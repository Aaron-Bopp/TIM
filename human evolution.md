#### <s class="topic-title">[[human evolution]]</s>

This is a miraculous and complicated process that has been taking place for 300,000 years.

> [!wikipedia:[human evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%20evolution)]
> 
> Human evolution is the evolutionary process within the history of primates that led to the emergence of Homo sapiens as a distinct species of the hominid family, which includes the great apes. This process involved the gradual development of traits such as human bipedalism and language, as well as interbreeding with other hominins, which indicate that human evolution was not linear but a web. 
> 
> Genetic studies show that primates diverged from other mammals about 85 million years ago, in the Late Cretaceous period, and the earliest fossils appear in the Paleocene, around 55 million years ago. 
> 
> Great apes diverged from gibbons some 15–20 million years ago; African apes diverged from orangutans about 14 million years ago; the tribe Hominini (including humans, Australopithecus, and chimpanzees) parted from the tribe Gorillini (gorillas) between 8–9 million years ago; and, in turn, the subtribes Hominina (humans and extinct biped ancestors) and Panina (chimpanzees) separated 4–7 million years ago.

#### The many keys to human evolution

##### Larger brains 

This is why [[Cracking bones and eating the marrow may have been human's first niche]] and [[Cooking allowed prehistoric humans to spend less energy on digesting]] are important, as they allowed for us to develop larger brains. 

##### Increased communication skills

Human's mastery of [[language]] is key to our abilities to understand each other. Our language is supple enough to transmit an unlimited amount of information from battle plans to gossip. #TO/DO/CITE 

##### Social cooperation

Our ability to communicate subjective matter's like emotions and feelings allows us to understand eachother socially unlike any other species. This increases our ability to trust and also our ability to know when not to trust.

##### Symbolism

[[Communication]] continues to lead the way as we start to construct symbols to more easily to transfer [[information]] to new generations.

[[Culture is built off of shared belief in an imagined reality]]

##### Social control

#### Advancement to today

Once these key traits were in place, adaptation and evolution would no longer be major players in [[human advancement]] and would instead take a backseat, providing the biological backdrop for [[human behavior]].  
In turn study of [[human behavior]] past this point stratifies into everything that is known today, but most immediately leads to:
