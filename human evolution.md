#### The many keys to human evolution

##### Larger brains 

This is why [[Cracking bones and eating the marrow may have been human's first niche]] and [[Cooking allowed prehistoric humans to spend less energy on digesting]] are important, as they allowed for us to develop larger brains.

In turn study of [[human behavior]] past this point stratifies into everything that is known today, but most immediately leads to:
