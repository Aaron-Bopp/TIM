#### <s class="topic-title">[[inflation theory]]</s> 

In physical cosmology, cosmic inflation, cosmological inflation, or just inflation, is a theory of exponential expansion of space in the early [[universe]]. The inflationary epoch lasted from 10−36 seconds after the conjectured [[Initial singularity]] to some time between 10−33 and 10−32 seconds after the singularity. Following the inflationary period, the universe continued to expand, but at a slower rate. The acceleration of this expansion due to dark energy began after the universe was already over 7.7 billion years old.
Many physicists also believe that inflation explains why the universe appears to be the same in all directions (isotropic), why the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] is distributed evenly, why the universe is flat, and why no magnetic monopoles have been observed.
