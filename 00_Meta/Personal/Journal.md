My religious upbringing is core to my understanding of the world

### 2021-12-21 12:17 pm

I am feeling really anxious. I am not quite sure why. It came as I was thinking about n[[note writing]], specifically differences between my system and the existing systems that it is based off of. I am going to see someone later, so it may just be [[social anxiety]], but it feels like something deeper. Like that I feel that I should be worried about something.

### 2021-12-12 12:39 am

I have been realizing how much of my difficulty comes from being scared or unaware of what others [[perception]]s of me are. I am obsessed with getting the right reactions from people, to the point of self-destruction. Obviously this isn't sustainable, nor am I trying to make it be. I am working towards finding a place where I can truly pursue being myself, both physically and mentally.

Observation: I don't think I ever struggled to observe social behaviors, I think I just struggled to apply them in my own life, because I was trying to ascribe [[neurotypical]] behaviors onto a [[neurodiversity|neurodiverse]] brain. I can observe and replicate an interaction of sincerity between friends, but I struggle to intuitively know when that sincerity would be met with disgust or appreciation. This is because I was not acting on a feeling of sincerity, I was trying to replicate a behavior and activate it based off perceived motivators. This is not because I cannot feel sincere, it's because the motivators for my form of sincerity are different from neurotypical people. Once I recognize this I can be just as sincere if not more sincere. The dissonance came because I was assumed to be and was trying to be something that I wasn't: [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]]

I've been thinking about the relationship between [[Empathy does not disallow judgment]] and [[You can't blame people for failing to rise above their circumstances]] recently in relation to the whole Gus Johnson situation. I realized that I was judging him, had no sympathy for him. I think it stems from the fact that we do have a similar background (grew up in the midwest), and that we are at a fairly similar stage in life. But Idk if that should rule out those two notes. Would I have done differently in his place, yes absolutely. Can I judge him for it? On principle I think no, but in practice I do. [[What is the difference between blame and judgement]]

I was fascinated by the concept of [[endurance]] when I was a kid. Was it because of [[ADHD]]? Enduring isn't effiecient? Was it because of [[transgender|trans]]? I was enduring so much? Was it because of [[Autism]]? lack of understanding emotion? #TO/PONDER/ME 

### 2021-10-23 4:10am

I've started using [[Spaced Repetition (plugin)]] to review the notes in my vault and its been going really well. I'm slowly making progress through my notes. I think it helps a lot with getting notes in my memory so that I can remember them when I need them, but we'll see how that goes as I get through my other 200 notes. I've also been making a lot of updates to my vault. Part of this was just because I discovered the search and replace tool on [[Visual Studio Code]], but it's also because I've just been excited to work in my vault. I've been thinking a lot about the structure (and come to the conclusion that it doesn't really matter), and have made some changes that reduce my stress while in the vault. I'm trying to use my entry points more and keep track of everything, but spaced repetition is the biggest thing.

What is the use of my intelligence if I can never find the answer? What is the use of my knowledge if I can never apply it? What is the use of my brain if it is riddled with chemical imbalances? I'm scared that one day I will finally realize that [[suicide]] has been the only reasonable option all along. What will happen when I grow tired of searching for the answers? I feel like a mad man. I'm so confused. I'm so incredibly confused and I think that hurts the most to say. What is the point... What is the god damn point.

If I'm not going to do it. Why? Maybe if I can at least answer that question I will be satisfied. If I can find the reason to continue on I will never need to answer questions again.

I've never wanted to be committed before this moment. I want all control stripped from me. I want to be naked.

I am in a strange state of hyperbolic lucidity. Manic lucidity. Maddening lucidity. I want to throw up

Will you not answer the questions?

Am I dissasociating? Am I just dramatic? Is imagining people reading this after my death the most logical thing to think?

Everything is a lie. Everthing is true

#### My unfulfilled need for parental validation became a fear of rejection and disregardment of affection

[[An unfulfilled need for validation results in a fear of rejection]] and [[A inwardly judgmental and outwardly accepting home creates trust issues]] were both at play during my childhood. [[my parents]] were very loving and very religious which I think is what brought about my [[religious trauma]] and my intense need for [[emotional validation]] from them.

### 2021-6-11

My self-image is purely based on other's perceptions of me

This is a bit part of [[My relationship with my parents]]. From an early age, [[Self-hatred is born out of dissonance between self-image and self-perception]] caused me to not trust my own experience of the world because as a [[transgender|trans]] person, my [[self-image]] or my gender was wholly different than the [[gender]] that was expected of me.

This really impacted my [[social anxiety]] because [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]].
#### I have a stored up emotion of hating myself

When human's feel a certain emotion, they have no choice but to deal with it. When they feel that emotion again they have a choice whether to deal with it the same way as before or a different way. 
^[#TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH [[empathy#Somatic empathy]] relationship [[Humans are a product of evolution]]]
In [[childhood]] we do not have many ways to deal with emotion, and so when they come up our brain will make strong and powerful decisions to deal with these emotions.
^[this is why [[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]]
The fundamental emotional reactions of crying, laughter, screaming, are all a part of how we deal with the world. This is instinctual, but as children develop they start to learn different methods of dealing with emotions. [[Parents need to model the ability to deal with emotion to their children]]. 

Unfortunately, one way of dealing with emotion is avoidance, and [[Avoidance IS the most-efficient way of dealing with emotion]]. 
#### In order to for my parents to love me, they need to admit they might be wrong

In order for me to feel like [[my parents]] [[love]] me, I need to see them empathize with me --> which requires them to consider the fact that they might be wrong:[[Empathy isn't understanding how you would make the decision it's understanding why they made the decision]]

[[empathy]] requires being able to put yourself in someone else shoes. For [[my parents]] this would mean recognizing that I may be right and that god doesn't exist. The reason this is so important to their [[love]] for me, is because their [[love]] for me is contingent on my being a [[Christianity|Christian]]. 

[[Loving a a non-believer requires loving the fact that they are going to hell]]. For me, the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] interpretation of hell, is so hateful, and destructive, that I cannot believe that the [[love]] [[my parents]] feel for me is real. If they did [[love]] me, they would not be able to live with the belief that I am going to hell. Similarly, [[Christians struggle to feel empathy because they must believe that non-christians are going to hell]]. 

This issue is not black and white, the [[love]] that [[my parents]] feel for me is real, but it is not as real, or as full as if I was a [[Christianity | Christian]]. They may never admit that their [[love]] is not real, but they admit that they do not [[love]] me as much as they would if I was a [[Christianity|Christian]]. I think that may be a thought that they have had. 

[[Religious concepts are often too powerful for a child's mind]]

#### I thought negative emotions were natural and that positive emotions weren't real

I think from an early age I had many sources of negative feedback for things that made me feel like who I was supposed to be was unnatural. Whether it was getting my hair cut short, or feeling a rush of testosterone when playing sports or being competitive, I didn't like the things that I was supposed to according to my assigned [[gender]] ([[Self-hatred is born out of dissonance between self-image and self-perception]], [[Gender Dysphoria is based in a intrinsic wrongness of self]]). Things that did make me feel good were discouraged and so I tried to repress to feeling and urges and in the process repressed most of my emotions. 

[[An unfulfilled need for validation results in a fear of rejection]]

The only logical thought process I could have at that age ([[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]) was that the positive emotions that received negative condemnation were unnatural and so I made a sweeping generalization that all positive emotions were unnatural. This is why I poured my interests into things that were intellectual pursuits. My unfulfilled need for parental validation became a fear of rejection and disregardment of affection

While I do think this sweeping generalization was there. Obviously as a child didn't understand it. Sometimes I would pursue things because I thought they really did make me happy, while other times they actually did make me happy but in a way that I didn't think was wrong. I still did things that makes me happy, I'm not going to lose those as I understand myself more ([[There aren't any downsides to working through trauma]]). As I have questioned my existence more and more I have discovered more and more internalized beliefs of mine that are irrational and unnatural. These discoveries give me hope, but the solution scares me. [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]]

This expanded on here: [[Sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion]]

You're never sure you're [[transgender|trans]]. I heard that in a [[tiktok]] today. I don't think you admit that you're [[transgender|trans]]. It's not a decision. You don't even really discover it. You just one day realize that you're a girl, and it makes total sense. That part is so obvious that it doesn't feel real. It feels like a dream that you can't achieve, and the process of achieving it is the difficult part

### 2021-05-29 6:52 pm

I seem to have had less [[anxiety]] since I started caring about [[socialization|social interaction]] as much. The reason I was able to care less is because I'm finding more joy in other things I do and I think maybe liking myself a little bit more

### 2021-05-24

I felt like my focus wasn't there today. I kept day dreaming about my future and other things while Nick was walking through the code. I was dreaming about my possible conversation with Ron Houston and what I would describe my career goal as. In those thoughts I was thinking about what kind of work would really fulfill me. I was thinking maybe being a consultant who comes in and has to absorb a lot of information fast and solve problems would be good for [[ADHD]] me but not for [[Adderall]] me. Like [[Adderall]] me really wants the overarching picture and to attack the problem from the outside in. What are ALL the inputs, how does EVERTHING work, before getting down to the smallest problem, but I feel like [[ADHD]] me would be better at absorbing needed information quickly and just solving the problem. Still not sure what my dream is, as I'm still questioning the role medication will play in my life. I'm not sure if I should even be on [[Adderall]] or if I'm taking too much. I might try on do a smaller dose tomorrow just to see what happens, but I think I will be sadder then. Not sure. I'm wondering if my problem is really a [[happiness]] thing and not a dopamine thing, or if the [[Adderall]] helps with the dopamine, but [[ADHD]] is not really the cause of it. [[ADHD]] makes sense, but I don't think it's a strong enough fit that other things couldn't be causing the problem.

When will I stop telling myself, "Just endure a little longer, Aaron. It'll be worth it in the end."

"Just endure a few more days, it'll be the weekend soon."
"Just endure a few more weeks, you'll see your sister soon." 
"Just endure a few more months, your internship will be over soon."

### 2021-05-14 12:34 am

I'm so confused. My brain just feels in a fog. I feel like the fog is emotion. I feel the fog is emotion I don't understand? Or maybe the fog isn't emotion, maybe the fog is my brain trying to find it's way through emotion. I can't think straight. I can't discover the source of this feeling. Why am I happy? Why do I feel like I could talk to people now? What is it about the last five days that has allowed me to feel this way and how do I replicate it? It feels good I think. I feels like I'm making progress, or is this just what my body needs. Is it the isolation and rest that is making me feel again, or is it the exploration of my gender? Or is it the reflection on my past when I was happy. Or is it the validation of my friends saying they [[love]] me. 

[[What is my path to happiness]]? 

Is what I'm feeling everybody else regular state or is it their hightened state? Because if its their hightened state, that would mean my normal state is normal, and that my feelings of brokeness are made up.

The genuine want to create and reach out to people feels unnatural because it is out of the norm, but it also feels like comfortable: it feels like it should be normal. 

I can't be normal. It shouldnt fell this odd to FEEL. Feeling should be the natural state, not not feeling. Or at least that's what I want it to be.

20 mins later back to feeling not much... Meh

[[I have a stored up emotion of hating myself]]
When this emotion comes up, the mind rationalizes it away, but the emotion is just stored away ([[Samskara]]: ball of emotion)

I don't know if I'm introspective, maybe I just spend a lot of time rationalizing [[my emotions]] instead of dealing them

I've always prided myself on being introspective, but as I watch and Dr. K's sessions and relate to something or see how something may have affected me it triggers my fight or fligh t. I'm starting to think that I'm not introspective, I just spend a lot of time rationalizing [[my emotions]] away instead of dealing with them.

I have a similar feeling where even when I'm happy and enjoying myself it feels pointless, because I know that sadness will come again anyways. I think maybe that's why you feel deflated/discouraged. You recognize that your productivity is the outlier not the rule, and you're not confident that it means anything. The fear of never stopping working seems like another thing, but idk what. I don't think either are weird or irrational thoughts though. 

The thought of idk how much pain im feeling/idk why im crying comes from [[my parents]] always discounting my crying by saying i have a fast cry trigger but I think that made me think that [[my emotions]] weren't natural and so I hid them and shut them off

Because I had so much trouble controlling [[my emotions]] as a child, I still view emotionality as weakness and there might be some misogyny there???? 
%% (yeah you're just trans hun 10/25/2021) %%

I isolate myself when I am sad or depressed because I am used to [[my emotions]] being invalidated. Did I say I don't know why I'm crying so often because if I said how I felt [[my emotions]] were invalidated or just because I actually didn't know? Why I am constantly searching for validation? What the fuck is even being validated? I never got an answer for why I was crying, so I just stopped crying. 

I'm never vulnerable, everything is always calculated.

I never allow myself to be vulnerable, I only do it when I forced to be.

Do I wanna be the girl or do I just want the [[emotional validation]] that girls get?

is it okay to want [[emotional validation]]? Do I want validation from people I know or people I don't know?

[[Emotional validation]] has been on my mind a lot recently. It feels like a lot of my worse behaviors are built around [[emotional validation]]. I cut myself off and refuse to reach out for help because I afraid that [[my emotions]] won't be validated. Of course this is a never ending circle
%%([[You can be taught to invalidate your own emotions]]) %%

Do I get tired of human interactions over time because I am an introvert or is the there a deeper meaning?

### April 2 

To [[my parents]], //My [[trauma]] manifesto

I loved you. I always loved you, from the day I saw your faces. I don't remember it, most kids don't, but I know I loved you. I don't [[love]] you anymore. I know it hurts to read, and I wish it hurt more to say. Turn away if you want. I can't hold back any longer. I can't coddle your feelings. You hurt me. Whether you like to admit it or not, whether you remember doing it or not, whether you believe you didn't or not. The [[purpose]] of my entire life has been to please you. I was never [[Christianity|christian]]. I pleased [[my parents]]. I was never a good student. I pleased [[my parents]]. I was never happy. I pleased [[my parents]]. 

Is this hyperbole? yes. Is it how I really feel? yes. You guys got lucky. You got a really smart kid. All your kids are smart, but ==only one had two examples of what not to do.== [^1] What not to do if you want to avoid that disapproving tone that strikes fear into our hearts to this day. You didn't have to beat me, ==I wish you did==.  I wish I could have realized earlier that there was no [[purpose]] in pleasing you. But how could I have known. How could I have known that ==who I was== [^2] would forever bar me from your [[love]]. I should have known that something about me that I couldn't change would be the reason that I would fail, because I changed everything else. Why do I have [[anxiety]]? because I see everything. Why do I hate myself for being [[Queer|gay]]? because I see everything. Why do I feel like the only thing that can make my life worth living is SAVING EVERYONE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD? because I see everything. ==Every disapproving stare==, ==every haughty laugh==, [^3] every pained face, every face with dried tears, every look of disdain, EVERY THING. I saw it all and I took it to heart. Everything was categorized: approved or not approved. If it was approved I strived for it. I made it part of my [[self]] worth. Why is every single part of my personality because of you? If it was disapproved of I shunned it. I buried it so deep inside of me that even I couldn't find it anymore. Thank god I'm smart enough not to send this. 

[^1]: I viewed myself as the best version of the brother a sister, even said it out loud for years ^8e0501
- I feel like it would be easier to admit and understand [[trauma]] that comes from a more common source ^ea7957
- being [[Queer|bisexual]]
- common from both [[parents]] ^14d024
- more common from mom than dad 

Eventually I buried so many things I thought I couldn't be saved. I started to get confused about what was a lie and what was me. How could I ever know if I was saved? I didn't know what I really thought, I didn't know if I was genuine or not because EVERYTHING I DID WAS TO PLEASE YOU. when I realized I couldn't do it anymore I gave up. I gave up trying, but I didn't give up hoping. I kept up appearances, because maybe I could do it. Maybe I could be the golden child. I failed. Eventually the facade started to slip. I started to realise I was happier when it did. I wanted to be honest with you but I was scared. Scared of the things that I had built my life to avoid. I learned how to manipulate so well I don't even know when I'm not. I don't know if I'll ever know if I'm genuine.

I don't know if I'll be able to work through this with you. For me this is freeing, but I don't know what itll be. I hope that deep down you've realized that maybe you made a mistake.

Why do I never reach out for help. I had to reach the point of emotional breakdown, on top of years of effort, just to give my Aunt a call. Why am I trained to keep it inside. I've always kept it inside. I could barely speak when I called her. I sounded like a driveling idiot. In your house that would have been an offence I wouldn't have allowed. I wouldn't have let that out. You wired my brain to be that way. You broke my brain. It's no surprise it took me so long to realize I had [[ADHD]]. In evolutionary theory, people with [[ADHD]] would have been the hunters. People whose brains were fast enough that they could be aware of every threat. Be aware of every opportunity of success. I was on the hunt, but really I was being hunted. I had so much going on that I needed that extra brain power. It wasn't until I was alone in my room with nothing to be afraid of that it was too much.

21 years its taken me to figure myself out.

[[Empathy]] first. I had [[empathy]] for you when Grandma died. It’s seared into my memory. I can remember it plain as day. It wasn't traumatic, but I think it changed me. I saw you grieving, I felt your pain. How I don't know but the brain is powerful and children's brains especially. Maybe I decided that I never wanted you to hurt that way because of me. Maybe I didn't understand it that well. I don't know

My childhood is a blur, I have memories but very few are strong. There's too many things to remember I suppose.

I can't believe [[my parents]]. My trust for them is broken. Too many lines crossed, too many problems disregarded. If you really loved me, it would be easy. There'd be nothing that could stand between you loving your child. No peace of [[theology]], no few verses in the bible, no single word in a single verse that was mistranslated in 1946. I know you think you [[love]] me. But you have to [[love]] all of me. and you have to like it. I can't compromise. I have my entire life.

I wish I could go back and not be [[Queer|bisexual]]. (this spawned a whole tangential brain tangent that I didn't write down) if that happened I wouldn't be writing this. I would be confused still. I probably would never address my [[trauma]]. Because being [[Queer|gay]] wasn't the reason I never felt loved. You didn't know, how could you, I hid it so well. I would still have [[anxiety]], I would still be depressed, I would still feel the weight of the world on my shoulders. I would have still have based every part of my life off of pleasing you. I just would have never realized it. Something about christianitys obsession with gayness never sat right with me. It was the start of it all, my walk away from the church, from my [[faith]], and finally from you. It is so incredibly illogical. It has no reason except embed hatred in the very nature of [[Christianity]]. It’s not a sin. It was never a sin. But it took the realm of sin away from action and into lifestyle.  How could you not hate people that LIVED A LIFE OF SIN. And once you hate one group of people for something they can't change it becomes a whole lot easier to hate other groups for the reasons they can't change. Who cares about poor people, it's their choice. Who cares about [[black people]], it's their choice. Who cares about [[Queer|gay]] people, it’s their choice.

I can't bottle this up. I will be dealing with this for the rest of my life. I have been dealing with it for my entire life. I just understand it better now.

I don't know if I'm right. Maybe I'm delusional. But I have to understand why I feel the way that I feel. it has to come from something. there is an explanation. maybe i've found it, but i don't know if i'll ever convince myself I have. I will live it. I will work through it. but it will never leave me.

### 3/28/20 1:17am 

Couple weeks into coronavirus quarantine. The loneliness is hitting hard, but I don't know if this is really because of the quarantine. I feel like I'm on the edge of the [[depression]] from last semester. I feel like the progress I've made is slowly slipping away. I feel like I'm becoming the person I was a few months ago, the one that was just okay, not the one that is improving. The worst part is I don't know how to stop it. I don't really know what I need to do to feel better. Maybe being creative will help, I can certainly try. 

### 3/13/20 12:37am 

The despair feels like it's hitting tonight. Life was going great, but it feels like I just got to a big cliff on the way up the mountain. I think I'll get up this cliff, I know I'll get up this cliff, but I dont know how long it will take, I don't know how hard it will be, and I don't know how much pain it will cause me. Coronavirus is sweeping the nation, not actually sweeping, just the fear mainly, and man is it fucking with stuff. I thought that a whole lot of other things would get in my way, but I never thought it would be a fucking virus. It's not so bad yet, my [[mental health]], but I can feel it getting worse, regressing back to what it was. I'm not sure if I'll be able to change things, now that I'm back in my old situation, but I hope I can. I hope you'll get some happy posts sometime journal, but I don't know when. 

### 3/12/20 1:30am 

I've just watched a video that resonated so deeply with me, that desperately want to find someone who can understand it. Unfortunately I feel it is so nice, and requires so much context to understand that any attempt to reach out and find a mutual audience for this video wouldn't result in me being seen as an outcast. 
I definitely feel like I am still figuring my life out, my brain out, my [[soul]] (? maybe [[conscious]]) out. I don't feel mentally stable, every day I could slip back into [[depression]], or bad habits. I have so many things that I want to do, but I feel like the world is always getting in my way. The better times get, the more I regret the past times that could've been better. Hopefully one day I get past that. It's interesting that I don't currently long for any past time. I feel like I'm at the peak of my life and the lowest point of my life at the same time, which means that I am currently on the slog up the hill to my peak, and the pain now is just the hard work to get there. Damn, that's the best thing to come out of these journal entries. I just shed a tear. 
I think mentally unhealthy people are easier to get into deep conversations with. Or maybe just people who are still working on their mental state. 

### 3/7/20 10:30pm 

It's okay to regret. Its okay to be sad. It's to improve yourself it's okay to get better. Even though it hurts. Even though every good time just makes all the bad times seem worse. Even though every bad time feels like it will last forever. Everybody has experiences that they regret. Everybody has times in their life that weren't as good. Everybody takes on life in a different way.

### 2/6/20 11:45pm 

I am feeling quite introspective tonight. I watched a youtuber who I haven't watched in a while. I expected his videos to make me feel sad and purposeless, but they made reavaluate my current spot in life. He struggled with living reactionarily, but reoriented his life to focus on what he valued. That brings the question, what do I value. 
That is a very hard question for me, as I do not have a solid [[purpose]] for living. The best I can think of is bringing [[happiness]] to myself and others, but that still feels like it's lacking something important, I just can't place my finger on it. 
What is the [[purpose]] of my life? 
Recently I have been living my life in a reactionary way. Minecraft provided me with joy and dopamine so I started playing it again, but what is playing advancing? It does improve my mood often and provide me with some temporary [[purpose]], but this is not lasting. I am spending quality time with Kire, which is important to do. He is my best friend and I think I am in some way improving his life. It is also detrimental to my schoolwork, but that has not proven serious as of yet. Really it is general apathy and laziness that hold the most danger for my school work 
I've decided to start writing this diary. Perhaps it will help me find something, or just put something into words, or maybe I'll wake up tommorow and be to apathetic to continue on the goals I set tonight. I uninstalled Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit. Not because they were really detrimental to my life, but because they allowed and escape that I was taking part in much to regularly. I hope to replace the time I spent on them with reading, but we'll see if that lasts. The bigger demon is YouTube, but I don't have the [[desire]] to cut it out. So much of what I watch is positive, it doesn't feel like the endless pit that the others are, even though it is. I might try and limit it but I don't know how I'd do that. 
Hopefully I'll spend this extra time doing things that I value, I just have to remember what those things are.
