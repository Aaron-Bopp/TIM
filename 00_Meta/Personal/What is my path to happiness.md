#### [[What is my path to happiness]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`
This is a question that I have pondered countless times through my life, ever since I realized my lack of [[happiness]] in high school. This is has taken many forms, a [[savior complex]], [[nihilism]], [[realism]] and [[pessimism]]. When I got diagnosed with [[ADHD]] I though that medication would be the answer, but when the [[happiness]] from being able to do things more easily started to go away I was left loss yet again. 

[[My Deconstruction journey]] > [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]] > [[Buddhism outlines a path and practice to end suffering, but does not promise it]]

For now I have settled on [[self-love]] as the answer and [[transgender|transitioning]] as the path.
