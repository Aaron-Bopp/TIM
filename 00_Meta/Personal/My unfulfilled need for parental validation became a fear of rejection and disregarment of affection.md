#### [[My unfulfilled need for parental validation became a fear of rejection and disregarment of affection]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[An unfulfilled need for validation results in a fear of rejection]] and [[A inwardly judgementful and outwardly accepting home creates trust issues]] were both at play during my childhood. [[my parents]] were very loving and very religious which I think is what brought about my [[religious trauma]] and my intense need for [[emotional validation]] from them.
