#### [[I have a stored up emotion of hating myself]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

When human's feel a certain emotion, they have no choice but to deal with it. When they feel that emotion again they have a choice whether to deal with it the same way as before or a different way. 
^[#TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH [[empathy#Somatic empathy]] relationship [[Humans are a product of evolution]]]
In [[childhood]] we do not have many ways to deal with emotion, and so when they come up our brain will make strong and powerful decisions to deal with these emotions.
^[this is why [[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]]
The fundamental emotional reactions of crying, laughter, screaming, are all a part of how we deal with the world. This is instinctual, but as children develop they start to learn different methods of dealing with emotions. [[Parents need to model the ability to deal with emotion to their children]]. 

#TO/PONDER/ME 
Unfortunately, one way of dealing with emotion is avoidance, and [[Avoidance IS the most-efficient way of dealing with emotion]].
