**<u>Companion Piece Write-Up (10 points)<u>**

**Instructions:** Access the assigned companion piece of the week (or find your own companion piece) and listen to, read, or watch the entire piece. Then, respond to all of the items. Your responses to each should be at least 0.5 double-spaced pages in size 12 font. To help, I grade 0.5 pages as 11 lines of content. If you have less than 11 lines, you will lose points for not writing enough.

**<u>Section 1 (Summary):</u>** Summarize the piece. Be sure to explain what the piece was about in enough detail that it is clear that you watched/read/listened to the entire piece. Also be sure to highlight aspects of the piece that show its relevance to race and/or [[gender]].

Treyvon Martin was shot when going to get snacks at the store.
Activist Sconik started a series called They Have a Name, that's goal was to make people aware of black kids being killed.
Zimmerman claimed that it was okay to shoot Treyvon because he "looked like a thug."
At first this story was like any other, but as Zimmerman continued to not be arrested people started to notice, and push for justice.
Lebron James, Dwayne Wade, convinced the Miami heat to use their platform to raise awareness for Treyvon.
They took a picture in their team hoodies.
The hoodie was a symbol.
The photo was a protest.
We all have hoodies, but Treyvon was killed for wearing his.
This event reignited influencers like athletes using their platform for politics and helped bring about movements for justice, like Black Lives Matter.
The conversation never ends because the murder of [[black people]] never ends.
Partially because of this it has become expected of influencers to use their platform to push for social change even if what they regularly do is completely unrelated.
Movements like Black Lives Matter have found a lot of traction in raising awareness and support for [[black people]] being killed.


**<u>Section 2 (Reading Connection):</u>** Discuss at least one **<u>reading from this week</u>** that relates to the piece. Be sure to explain which reading you are discussing, what the reading said about the topic, and how the reading is connected to the piece.

The murder of Treyvon Martin was likely an awakening moment in lots of [[black people]]'s identity development.
Both seeing Treyvon killed for such a pointless reason, and seeing no justice for his killer, brought a lot of awareness to way [[black people]] are treated differently in America. 
The murder of Treyvon Martin and the response of the Miami heat are very important parts of the encounter stage of the Nigrescence Black Identity Model. 
Treyvon's murder is very easy to personalize because everybody wears hoodies and yet Treyvon was killed for wearing his. 
He could look exactly like your nephew, your son, your brother, or even yourself, and was doing nothing wrong at the time of his death.
Additionally because of the way that new of Treyvon's death spread, it allowed it to be parred to positive and constructive messaging. 
Activists provided opportunities to fight for justice for Treyvon and change in the system, and influencers like the Miami Heat provided solidarity and support for those who were shocked by the event. 
This is important to the identity model, because if an encounter is negative and invdividual may not be as willing to commit to the Immersion-Emersion Stage.
These events can also relate to the White Identity Model becaue both general messages of support, like the Miami Heat's, and specific message like Sconik's "They Have a Name" series push the existence of systemic [[racism]] into the [[conscious|consciousness]] of white people.


**<u>Section 3 (Personal Reflection):</u>** Discuss how the piece relates to your own life experiences. Consider how the stories or information presented is similar to, or different from, what you've experienced. If the piece focuses on an identity very different from your own, you can think about how not having that identity has led to a different life. You can also discuss memories that the piece made you think of. You should <u>not</u> give your opinion or evaluation of the piece, and you should <u>not</u> just talk about how it made you feel (e.g. "this topic makes me sad").

I think that a lot of white people and especially religious white people who are unaware of their privilege and the existence of systemic [[racism]] are hesitant to engage with stories like Treyvon's because it shatters their moral superiority. When I was a kid I believed that [[my parents]] and the church were in the moral majority, and I prided myself on the [[empathy]] I had for other people. I remember reading and sharing messages about how bad Obamacare was because I believed it was truly making peoples lives worse. My father repeatedly shares stories about how his father lead an African-American battalion in [[WW2|World War 2]]. Our core belief was that [[racism]] no longer existed and that our beliefs were generally correct and any questioning of that was a slight to my grandfather and to my [[empathy]]. So stories like Treyvon's would make us sad, but anything that pointed towards the root cause of systemic [[racism]], would immediately be discarded. I think this could affect why it is so exhausting for people of color to continually educate white people, and why so many people who espouse [[unconditional love]] are so unwilling to address systemic [[racism]].
