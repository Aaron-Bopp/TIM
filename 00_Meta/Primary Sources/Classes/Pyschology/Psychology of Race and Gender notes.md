# Week 2
- Readings

	- [[National SEED Project - 'White Privilege Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack' and 'Some Notes for Facilitators]]
## Multiculturalism and Colorblindness
- Multiculturalism => multiple cultures living together and supporting each other without assimilating or sacrificing their culture.
	- what if people don't want to be a part of a culture that they are recognized for?
	- cons
		- can lead to tokenism and stereotyping 
- Color blindness => seeing everybody as equal, not labeling people according to the color of their skins
	- seen as separate from using color blindness to make racist remarks
	- != ignoring race's existence, applies more in individual situations
		- even if you can be colorblind you that will blind you to other peoples [[racism]]
##  Barriers: White Privilege 
- Privilege is exemption from struggles or added obstacles based solely on your social identity
	- people can have advantaged and disadvantaged identities [[intersectionality]]
	- race, ability, socio-economic status, religious status, [[gender]] are all forms of privilege
# Week 3
## Readings
- [[Historical Foundations of Race]]
- [[Winton (2020) - Scientific Racism and North American Psychology 1.pdf]]
## Race
- Race is a social classification based solely off of the color of your skin
- Races have been created for classifying and otherizing various groups of people over the years 
- Difference between race, ethnicity, and nationality
	- race is physical experience
	- ethnic background
	- place where a person holds citizenship
- Race is socially constructed
	- there is nothing in our genes that determines what [[black people]] or white people look like only arbitrary physical characteristics
	- if race is more than biology
		- racial differences arent due to biology
		- societal hierarchies around race are not based on "real" differences
		- the concepts of race and racial groups are malleable not fixed
	- intially used to reinforce racial inequality
		- science was only incorporated to justify inequality
	- early racial conceptions still persist today through steriotypes, raical categories, scientifiic research
- Race still exist despite being socially constructed
- There is nothing racist about categorizing people by race, it is when you treat people differently based off that group that it becomes racist.
### Scientific Racism
- The use of science to justify racist beliefs and racial stratification
- There has been a lack of objectivity in race based science
- Physiognomy: judging psychological factors based on external appearance, especially the face
	- now known as a pseudo-science 
- r/K theory: species can be ordered on a continuum based on number and quality of offspring
	- lower species have more/worse offspring, "higher" species have fewer/better
- cephalic [[INDEX]]: some races have smaller brains == lower IQ scores
- IQ scores increasing over time
	- black scores are increasing faster than other groups
- racial admixture
	- black kids with high iqs do not reliably have more european dna than those with lower IQs
- it all comes down to socio-economic status
# Week 4
## Readings
- [[Gray et al. (2020) - COVID-19 and the Other Pandemic.pdf]]
- [[7 Ways We Know Systemic Racism Is Real]]
## Institutional and Systemic Bias
- Why was there resistance to black lives matter?
	- White lives matter supporters didn't understand the point of BLM
	- People are made uncomfortable by the discussion/acknowledgement of the [[racism]] in america
- [[Racism]] vs systemic [[racism]]
	- [[racism]] is individual comes from disdain ahtred of a certain group
	- systemic [[racism]] is when the systems of society have been built to reinforce individuals [[racism]]
- Institutional bias - discrimination ingrained into society through culture, [[government|govt]], laws, norms
	- implicit or explicit (discrimination vs privelege)
- What is causing institutional bias?
## Racial disparities in covid
- [[black people]] (and navajo people) more likely to catch and more likely to die from covid
- Causes: Some of these are correlations not causation of race
	- Hospitals underfunded
	- higher percentage essential workers
		- can't work from home
		- can't take time off to get healthcare
	- crowded and multigenerational housing
	- less likely to have health insurance
	- distrust of healthcare and [[government|govt]]
	- higher rate of pre-existing conditions
		- lower health outcomes
		- lower life expectancy
	- lack of education
- Systemic causes:
	- poverty
	- redlining
	- school funding
	- biased research/medicine
	- historical discrimination
	- history history of racist treatment
	- slavery (==?what can we do about slavery today?how does this effects the conversation about solutions?==)
	- feedback loop
- Hurricane Katrina = example of inequal treatment in healthcare
# Week 5 

1.  [[Ritchey (2014) - Black Identity Development 1.pdf]] 
2.  [[Cook & McCoy (2017) - Messages in Collusion 1.pdf]] 
## Identity
- Identity models are about experience not age periods
### Black identity
- Black identity developmental model with goal of a positive racial identity with strong importance to [[self]]
	- Invented by a white man (Cross) who said it should only be for black identities
	- 4-5 stages
		1. pre-encounter
			- unware of race
			- identity is focused on othe internal aspects
			- disinterested in black issues or anti-black attitudes
				- white is taugh as the default
				- colorblind narratives are more dominant and so they won't understand the racial reasons behind inequalities
		2. encounter/personalize
			- event that evokes racial awareness
			- can be good or bad
			- can happen many times
				- reinforces or bring's it back to the forefront
			- individuals's sense of [[self]] is impacted and they re-evaluate
		3. Immersion-Emersion
			- immersion = full intense engagement in black culture
			- emersion - emergence from immersion with a nuanced understanding of racial identity/culture/relations
			- characterized by (justified) rage toward whiteness
		4. Internalization
			- transitions from action and emotion to internal change and view of [[self]]
	- criticisms
		- only applicable to african-[[America|americans]]
		- one-directional
			- people shift from stage to stage back and forth
### White identity 
- Abandonment of [[Racism]]
	1. Contact
		- Lack of awareness of race is importance in society
		- all people are evaluated by white criteria
	1. Disintegration
		- acknowledge race ==> feelings of guild, shame, [[anxiety]]
	1. Reintegration
		- Reversion back to recially-biased beliefs
		- idealization
		- racial superiority
		- guilt => fear anger
		- active vs passive expression
- To be not be racist you have to be anti-racist
	- you still benefit from white privelege even if you are not racist
- Defining a non-racist white identity
	1. Pseudo-independent
		- personal ownership of [[white privelege]]/[[racism]]
		- microagressions unconscious bias still present
		- wants to help POC but can become paternalistic
	2. immersion/emersion
		- immersion = what does a non-racist white person look like
		- emersion - how do I want to embrace whiteness
	3. autonomy
		- internalization of positive white identity
		- race is not viewed negatively
		- cfronts [[racism]]
		- rejects privilege
		- comfort when interacting with POC
