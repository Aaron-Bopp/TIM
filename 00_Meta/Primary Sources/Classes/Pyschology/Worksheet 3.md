**[Worksheet 3 (25 pts)]{.ul}**

**Instructions:** Respond to each of the following prompts by typing in the space below the prompt. Answers should be written in essay style, not bullet points. Keep in mind that short, 1-2 sentence responses are likely not enough to receive full credit for any of these prompts.

**Chapter 2: Theoretical Perspectives on Gender (pp. 33-50)**

**1.** Think of an example from your own life where you learned how to act according to your gender through social learning theory. Be sure to explain the example from your life, the concept from social learning theory, and how your example shows that concept in action. **(2 pts)**

When I was around 6 or 7, I told my mother that I wanted to be a girl. She looked at me in disgust and from that point on I knew that I was not a girl, I could not act like a girl, and that I would never be a girl. From then on the main part of social learning theory that applied to me was observational learning and imitation. I didn't need to be punished or reinforced because from that point on I was very focused on falling into the male model. Specifcally for imitation I would convince my mom to get me sweaters like my dad wore (he was a 50-year-old children's pastor). For observational learning, I was very nervous one day because I did not have any shorts that covered my knees, which is what my brother's short's did.

**Chapter 7: Lifespan Development (pp. 151-179)**

**2.** As discussed on p. 162 of your textbook, what is the *gender segregation effect*? Did your own childhood reflect this effect, or was your childhood different? Be specific. **(2 pts)**

The gender segregation effect is the way that children seperate themselves into male and female groups by gender, and has been ovserved across multiple different cultures with varying levels of gendered socialization. One possible root is boy's affinity for more energetic play, and girl's affinity for more social play. Children will encourage gendered behaviors in eachother when in grouped, but children playing alone have minimal gender differences. I was a pretty anti-social child, and bad at sports so I didn't really take part in much peer play. 

**Chapter 3: Gender Stereotypes and Gender Differences (pp. 61-81)**

**3.** Aggression, impulsivity, self-esteem, and helping behavior are four areas of potential gender differences discussed in chapter 3 of the textbook (pp. 71-76). Choose [two]{.ul} of these four and discuss the presence or absence of gender differences, being sure to explain (in your own words) what the difference is, what researchers believe is causing the difference, and in what circumstances the difference arises. **(2 pts)**

Aggression is often cited as the most gendered area, with men being seen as much more aggressive, but research suggests that this difference is mostly in physical aggression and the expectation of aggression. Studies into verbal aggression and indirect or relational aggression show no difference, while physical aggression is higher in boys. A study also showed that when gender roles are demphasized through deindividuation it eliminates the gender difference. While the cause is not clear between biological or social, it seems the main difference is in physicality and the social acceptance of aggression not in levels of aggression.

**4.** In your own words, explain the concept of stereotype threat as discussed by the authors on pp. 65-68 and in the lecture. In your summary, be sure to:

a.) Define stereotype threat; **(1 pt)**

[[Stereotype threat]] is when a person is concerned a negative sterotype affecting their treatment in a situation. This can lead to lower performance and higher stress. 

b.) Provide two examples of stereotype threat from the text, being sure to explain how they show stereotype threat; and **(2 pts)**
1. Black student's that were told a test was a measure of intelligence performed worse that black students who were told the opposite and both groups of white students.
2. Asian-American women performed better on math exams when their asian identity was empahsized and worse when their gender identity was emphasized


c.) Explain two psychological processes underlying stereotype threat. **(2 pts)**

There are two pyschological processes that underlie stereotype threat:
1. *Underperformance due to extra pressure*: The extra pressure of disproving a stereotype and avoid conflict leads to a lower [[working memory]]
2. *Underperformance due to threats of self-integrity and belonging*: If a person's [[self-worth]] or sense of belonging is threatened by a situation will protect themself by setting lower goals, withdrawing from the situation, or having less motivation.
**Chapter 10: Biology and Gender (pp. 223-240)**

**5.** Summarize the evidence presented in the textbook for the presence or absence of gender differences in the brain areas listed below. In each case, along with a summary of the evidence, be sure to state whether the research suggests a gender difference exists. **(3 pts)**

a.) The hypothalamus (p. 233)

The hypothalmus contains estrogen receptors that affected during fetal developement. In females, these estrogen receptors are turned on which makes them more sensitive to estrogen in the blood stream. This increases central nervous system excitability and creates a cyclic release of hormones into the bloodstream. In males the estrogen receptors are deactivated, which creates an acyclic release of hormones. It is theorized that these hormonal differences affects sexual and aggressive behavior. A gender difference exists

b.) The amygdala (pp. 233-234)

The amygdala is different sizes in men and women, but when studies are controlled for total brain volumen there is no difference in size by gender. 

c.) The "left-brained, right-brained" concept (pp. 234-235)

While we primarily do certain aspects of processes in certain hemispheres (right handed, right-eared), there is no difference for verbal or spatial skills by gender. Most skills are two complex to localized to one hemisphere.

**Sansfacon et al. (2020) -- I Knew That I Wasn't Cis**

**2.** The authors state that their research supports the presence of three *trajectories* of gender identity development in their transgender sample. In your own words, explain each of the three trajectories. In your explanation, be sure to describe the pattern of behavior that characterizes this trajectory as well as external factors that may lead someone to follow this trajectory instead of another one. **(6 pts)**

#TO/DO/CONCEPTUALIZE 
Trajectory A: these children realize dissonance in their gender early on and are able to process and verbalize it with their parents, and then receive support. 
Trajectory B: these children notice diferences early on, but either due to them struggling to understand them, looking for support and being rebuffed, or repressing these feelings, do not fully understand these differences until puberty makes them more prominent.
Trajectory C: these subjects do not report any feelings of wrongness in childhood, but differences become obvious once puberty hits. A factor for this may be indentifying as non-binary, so differences are less pronounced, even though they exists in childhood.

**Olson et al. (2016) -- Mental Health of Transgender Children**

**6.** Some research suggests that trans people have higher rates of psychological disorder compared to the general population. However, the authors note that these findings are usually based on research with people who transitioned later in life. Using information from pp. 5-7, and in your own words:

**a.)** Summarize the findings of Olson et al. (2016) as to the mental health of trans children. **(2 pts)**

Prepubescent social transition eliminated the mental health differences between cis and trans children. The author's place several qualifications that mainly relate to the higher quality of parental support in this sample. Due to the controversiality of transitioning this early the children were likely very confident in their gender identity and the parents were very willing to accept that. This level of parent child communication could also lead to better outcomes. 

**b.)** Is this data the same or different from that obtained with adults who transition later in life? **(1 pt)**

Different, adults who transition have much worse mental health outcomes.

**c.)** What factors might account for the similarities/differences between this study and previous research on trans mental health? Name and discuss at least one factor. **(2 pts)**

These children had lower internalizing symptons than previous studies. The previous studies included children that had not socially transitioned and used different scales.
