-   [[Evolution]]

- 

## Organic vs Inorganic Molecules

-   Organic: any molecule with a carbon and hydrogen backbone skeleton

-   Monomer: smaller molecules that act as building blocks

-   Polymer: larger molecules made up of repeating units of monomers joined covalently in a chain

## Carbohydrates

-   Carbohydrates are things like glucose sucrose starch and fiber

-   Follow the formula (CH~2~O)~n~

-   Monomers are known as monosaccharides (simple sugars, glucose, fructose)

-   Polymers are disaccharides (2 monomers, polysaccharides (many monomers)

-   Often Hydrophilic

-   Dehydration Synthesis -- when two polymers join together and give off water

-   Hydrolysis -- adding water to break apart a polymer

## Lipids

-   Amphipathic -- molecule with a polar region and a non-polar region

-   Saturated Fats -- straight structure, packs tightly, usually forms solids like butter, animal fats

-   Unsaturated -- bent structure (double carbon bond), loose, usually forms oil, seeds fats

-   Complete fats are made up of saturated and unsaturated

-   [[transgender|Trans]] fats are unsaturated fats where the H where lost on both sides. (Cis is normal saturated fat)

-   Phospholipids (the amphipathic lipid) -- forms the cell membrane

## Proteins

-   Essential to life

    -   Structural support inside and outside of cell

    -   Backbone for structures in cell

    -   Formation of enxymes

    -   Structure behind antibodies of the immune systems

    -   Most end in -ase

    -   Are reaction specific which is determinied by their active site

    -   Are not used up in reaction

    -   Substrates bind at the active site of the enzyme and become products

    -   Ezyme-substrate complex: whne the substrates and enzymes are bound together

    -   Facilitates 100 reactions per second

    -   pressure -- can cause denaturation

    -   enzyme concentration -- not enough enzyme

    -   substrate concentration

    -   not enough substrates

    -   inhibitors and cofactors

-   Enzyme Inhibition

    -   Competitive inhibitors act like substrate imposters and bind to the enzymes active site, blocking the true substrate

    -   Non-competitive inhibitors bind to the allosteric site (other place)

-   Denaturation: loss of 3d shape, all proteins are susceptible

## Nucleic Acids

# Cells

-   Cells basic unit of living matter

    -   Separated from environment by cell membrane

-   Cell Theory Tenets

1.  All know living things are made up of cells

2.  Cell is the structural and functional unit of all living things

3.  All cells cone from pre-existing cells by division

4.  Cells constrain hereditary information which is passed from cell to cell during cell division

5.  All cells are basically the same in chemical composition

6.  All energy flow (metabolism and biochemistry) of life occurs within cells

-   Cells are limited in how large they can be because of the surface area to volume ratio does not stay the same as their size increases. This makes it harder for large cells to get rid of waste

-   Structure of Cell

    -   The plasma membrane (surrounds cell)

    -   Cytoplasm that suspends the cell contents and dissolves substances

    -   The DNA containing region in eukaryotic celsl this area is called the nucleus, in prokaryotic the nucleoid region (doesn't have a membrane)

    -   Mosaic refers to the presence of many different components that are incorporated into the membrane

-   Components of membrane

    -   Phospholipids -- primary component, amphipathic (polar and non-polar region), form a double layer (bilayer)

    -   Cholesterol -- give structure between the tails of the phospholipids

    -   Glycolipids -- phospholipids with a carbohydrate attached. Identify the cell

    -   Glycoproteins -- are proteins with carbohydrates, function same as glycolipids

    -   Proteins -- many different proteins are fit in the membrane. Red blood cell has 50 different proteins

-   Membrane Proteins

    -   Peripheral proteins -- not imbedded in the hydrophobic middle of membrane

    -   Integral proteins -- imbedded in hydrophobic region

    -   Transmembrane integral protein -- spans both of the phospholipid layers

        -   Channel proteins -- act as a tunnel in the membrane that allows substances in/out

        -   facilitated diffusion -- requires membrane protein otherwise same as diffusion

        -   osmosis -- movement of water is inverse of the movement of substances because as substances increase concentration water decreases (salts and solutes suck water)

            -   isotonic solution -- solutions with equal solute concentration

            -   hypertonic solution -- higher solute concentration, less water needed

            -   hypotonic solution -- lower solute concentration, more water needed

    -   Active transport: requires energy, moves substances from low to high concentration, requires membrane protein

        -   membrane pumps -- concentrate ions on one side of membrane

    -   Chemical -- stored in chemical bonds like calories

    -   Solar -- from sunlight

    -   Thermal -- heat (not useful in biology)

    -   Potential -- energy derived from position

-   Entropy -- energy goes from an ordered to disordered state

-   Energy comes from the sun

-   Autotrophs (self-feeders) -- producers or their own organic material from inorganic nutrients (plants)

-   Heterotrophs (consumers) -- cannot make organic molecules from inorganic ones

-   ATP -- energy currency of the cell (made of adenine bases, ribose sugar, phosphate group)

-   Energy is stored in the phosphate group. Converting ATP to ADP releases energy (exergonic reaction)

-   Cellular respiration -- getting energy from food molecules (breaks down glucose and stores in ATP) can happen with or without oxygen (aerobic with O, anaerobic w/o O)

-   **Glucose + Oxygen -\> Carbon Dioxide + Water + Energy (ATP)**

## Cellular Respiration

-   Glycolysis -- glucose is broken down into 2 molecules of pyruvate in the cytoplasm

-   If oxygen is present (aerobic ) pyruvate moves into mitochondria and it enters the krebs cycle

-   If no oxygen (anaerobic) pyruvate stays in the cytoplasm and undergoes fermentation creating lactic acid in animals and ethanol in yeast

-   Krebs (citric acid) cycle -- creates electron carriers (NADH FADH which run the electron transpot chain) and a little ATP

-   Electron transport Chain -- Hydrogen is pumped out of the mitochondria and come back in through ATP Synthase (an enzyme) producing lots of ATP

-   Important shit

    -   **Glycolysis**: Glucose 2 Pyruvate, 2 net ATP, 2 NADH.

    -   **Krebs Cycle**: 2 ATP, Electron carriers produced (6 NADH and 2 FADH~2~) along with CO~2~ as a by-product (you're breathing this out).

    -   **Electron Transport Chain**: 32 ATP and water is produced.

-   **Energy Output**

    -   Glycolysis: 4 gross ATP, **2 ATP** net gain.

    -   Fermentation: just **2 ATP** produced in glycolysis.

    -   Krebs Cycle: **2 ATP**.

    -   Electron Transport Chain: **32 ATP**.

    -   Total ATP for aerobic reactions: **36 ATP/ glucose molecule**.

    -   Total ATP for anaerobic: **2ATP/glucose**.

- 

## Photosynthesis

-   Photosynthesis -- biological process that takes light energy and converts in to chemical energy

-   **Carbon Dioxide + water --(light)> sugar + oxygen**

-   Pore on undersurface of plant leaf (dermal layer) called stomata. Oxygen goes out CO2 goes in water is lost from evapotransporation

-   Chloroplasts

    -   Stroma -- liquid interior

    -   Grana towers made of thylakoids that have photosynthetic pigment molecules in their membrane

        -   Chloropyll a -- most abundant pigment, expensive to produce because it contains magnesium and nitrogen, absorbs violet-blue and orange red, reflects green, absorbs highest energy light

        -   Chlorophyll b -- accessory pigment, carbonyl group, also contains magnesium and nitrogen, absorbs blue light and reflects yellow-green

        -   Carotenoids and Xanthophylls -- many individual pigments (carotenoids), cheap molecules (no-nitrogen), reflects red, orange, yellow

    -   Key stages of photosynthesis

        -   Absorption of light -- cause pigments to lose electrons which breakdown water producing oxygen and hydrogen,

        -   Conversion of light energy in chemical energy (ATP and NADPH) - hydrogen is used to create ATP

        -   Use of chemical energy to convert atomospheric CO2 into carbohydrates -- calvin cycle takes in CO2 from atmosphere and uses the ATP/NADPH to create glucose

    -   Red algae -- marine, multicellular, photosynethetic, used in ice cream and sushi

    -   Chlorophytes -- green algae, symbioses with fungi (licken, 6% of earth surface, cndiarians, mulluscs,

    -   Choanoflagellates and relative -- closest protist to animal, flagellum with collar of microvilli, unicellular and colonial, life cycles unknown, pseudopodia extends through pores,

-   Common themes

    -   Diverse ecological roles - Producers consumers, parasites, symbionts

    -   Diverse habitats -- aquaic, terrestrial, parasites

    -   Many single celled

    -   Multicellularity and differentiation

Fungi

-   Deocomposers -- some parasites other form sybioses

-   Heterotrophs eat through absorption

-   Hyphae -- cells of filmentous fungi forms the mycelium

-   Coenocytic -- hyphae lack cross-wires

-   Chytridomycota -- unicellular, parasites of protists, spherewith branching rhizoids, produce zoospores for reproduction

    -   Causes chytridiomcosis -- mass extinctions of amphibians

-   Zygomycota -- bread molds, sporangiophores to reproduce asexually

-   Pilobolus -- sporangia blast spores far to infect new dung, coenocytic

-   Ascomycota -- yeats, mildew, etc, true hyphae with crosswalls, asexual via conidia, sexual via ascospores

    -   Symbionts in lichens

    -   Associate with plant roots/leaves

    -   Saprobes in ligno-cllulos
