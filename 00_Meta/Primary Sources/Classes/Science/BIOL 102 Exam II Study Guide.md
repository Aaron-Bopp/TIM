Terms:

DNA Polymerase -- replicates DNA

Helicase -- separate strands of dna

Topoisomerase -- can withstand high temperatures

Intron -- junk, will get cut out of actual protein

Exon - protein

mRNA -- brings message to ribosome to make amino acids

tRNA -- takes amino acids to the ribosomes

rRNA -- structural component of RNA

codon

anticodon

Cancer -- cell that is constantly dividing

Metastasis -- cancer cells break off and start to tumor

Benign

Malignant

Denaturation -- DNA breaks apart due to high PH, heat

Annealing -- primers (starting point for polymerase) come in and bind to DNA

Elongation

*Taq* Polymerase -- used by man to duplicate dna

Primer - (starting point for polymerase)

Vector -- doesn't directly cause [[disease]] but does spread it

Plasmid -- starting point of DNA

Restriction Enzymes -- cuts dna at certain points

Oncogene -- can become cancer cell

Proto-oncogene

Concepts:

-   What did Erwin Chargaff discover? If given the percentage of one nucleotide, be able to calculate the percentage of the remaining nucleotides.

-   What contribution did Rosalind Franklin make to the discovery of the structure of DNA?

-   What did Watson and Crick do?

-   Be able to describe the structure of DNA (i.e. nitrogenous bases, phosphates, sugars).

-   If given a DNA sequence, be able to give the complementary sequence, mRNA sequence, and amino acid sequence. You will be given a copy of the genetic code to determine the amino acid sequences.

-   Remember what 3' and 5' notations mean.

    -   Starting and ending of dna sequence

-   Know the enzymes involved in DNA replication and their functions.

-   Be able to write out the central dogma. Know where each step of the central dogma occurs (nucleus, cytoplasm, ribosomes, etc.)?

    -   The two-step process of transcription and translation

    -   RNA is synthesized by RNA polymerase

-   Know the differences between DNA and RNA. We saw three kinds of RNA -- what were they?

-   Know the three steps of PCR, what happens in each step, and the approximate temperatures at which each step occurs.

-   Know the ingredients of a PCR reaction.

-   What makes *Taq* polymerase so special? Why is it used in PCR instead of a DNA polymerase from a chicken or some other animal?

-   Know what restriction enzymes do and how they are used in recombinant genetics.

-   Understand the process of recombinant DNA technology.

-   Consider the positive and negative aspects of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). Be able to list and describe a few of each.

Differences Between RNA and DNA

DNA -- not mobile, Zx-stranded, Thymine, Deoxyribose, hereditary material

RNA -- mobile, single-stranded, Uracil, ribose, protein blueprint

**[Chapter 5: Chromosomes and Inheritance]{.ul}**

Terms:

Chromatin -- carry genetic material in eukaryotes

Genes

Histones

Sister Chromatids -- same gene duplicated, mitosis splits it apart

Centromere -- center of chromatid X

Centrosome -- makes spindle fiber

Mitotic Spindle=spindle =

fibers=microtubles - used in mitosis for moving stuff around

Centriole -- acts as anchor so you can pull apart sister chromatids

Cleavage Furrow

Cell Plate

Cytokinesis -- splits into new cells after mitosis is complete

Homologous Chromosomes -- get one from mom and one from dad, same gene but differences

Haploid -- sex chromosomes/cells (gametes)

Diploid -- rest of the chromosomes

Crossing Over -- creates variation

Random Assortment

Karyotype

Gametes

Phenotype

Genotype

Gene

Allele

Homozygous

Heterozygous

Truebreeding

Sex-linked inheritance

Barr Body

Sex chromosomes

Autosomes

Sex-influenced traits

Multiple Alleles

Pleiotropy

Concepts:

-   Why does a cell do mitosis? What cells do mitosis?

-   What is the difference between mitosis and cytokinesis?

-   In which stage of the cell cycle does a cell spend the majority of its life? In which stage is a cell metabolically active (does cell stuff)?

    -   interphase

-   Know and [[love]] the four stages of mitosis, be able to name them in order (use a mnemonic to help you), know generally what happens in each stage, and be able to draw and name them. Don't just copy from your book/internet but truly understand what happens at each stage. You need to draw the nuclear envelope, DNA, chromosomes, centromeres, and spindle fibers at each stage if they are present.

-   Which types of cells form a cleavage furrow vs. a cell plate?

-   Know how many chromosomes are present in human cells in both the diploid and haploid stages.

-   Know the stages of meiosis (PMAT x2) (see below) and be able to describe the end product.

-   How does Meiosis I differ from Meiosis II? Which stages are characterized by haploid cells? Diploid?

-   When does crossing over occur? Why is crossing over important?

-   What is random assortment? How does random assortment work?

-   What are the two ways that genetic variation is increased through meiosis?

-   Know the differences between mitosis and meiosis. **Draw the stages of each below**.

-   Know the difference between genotype and phenotype.

-   Name and describe Mendel's two laws of heredity.

-   Where are alleles located on chromosomes? Why do humans have two copies of a gene?

-   Be able to identify homozygous and heterozygous organisms when given the genotype.

-   Be able to complete Punnett square problems and answer questions about the results. You should be able to set up and complete both monohybrid and dihybrid crosses.

-   Know what a test cross is and why it is valuable. Be able to determine the genotype of an organism if given the mate and offspring genotypes.

-   If given a karyotype, be able to determine the sex of the individual from which the karyotype was made.

-   Know the difference between the four types of dominance that can appear in alleles and be able to determine the phenotype. (Complete dominance, incomplete dominance, codominance, and sex-linked).

-   Know which sex chromosomes are found in males and which are found in females.
