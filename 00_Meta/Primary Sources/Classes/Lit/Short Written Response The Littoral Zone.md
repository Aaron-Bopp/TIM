Intro to Lit Fall 2020

Short Written Response 1

In "The Littoral Zone," Andrea Barnett uses non-linear storytelling and third-person narration to slowly introduce the story to the reader in a very specific way. This method builds intrigue and influences the reader's position on the events of the story. The story is told from a sky-high point of view as if looking back on the character's lives. The first sentence sets the stage as 15 years ago, but it quickly jumps around in time. This obscures the actual relationships of the characters long enough to change the reader's opinion of them.

The reader is introduced to the main characters, Jonathan and Ruby, when they are still strangers, but their future relationship can be inferred with lines like, "The days before they became so aware of each other have blurred in their minds." Their first meeting is flirtatious, but The reader knows nothing else about their lives. The reader is easily charmed by these two characters, and their meeting seems to be an idyllic romantic encounter. Over the next few pages, Barnett starts to reveal the actual nature of their relationship.

Immediately following this flirtatious meeting is a jump forward to their worst moment: when they walk off the boat to see their separate families, "standing there, unaware and hopeful." The reader does not know what has happened between Jonathan and Ruby, but their mind can only race at the possibilities. This way of storytelling creates an incredibly compelling narrative, and it would be impossible without the non-linear storytelling and sky-high point of view.

Throughout the rest of the story, it jumps back and forth in Jonathan and Ruby's lives. The reader learns about their cheating and obsession with each other. The reader also sees how much it hurt their families, and how the regret they hold is barely held back. What is more interesting is what The reader doesn't see. The reader doesn't see the years in court or the hundreds of fights. The reader doesn't see their release when they finally get married to each other. All this is only inferred or referenced in lines like, "For months after this, as they lay in stolen, secret rooms between houses and divorces and jobs and lives." Holding back the details is imperative to maintaining the interest of the reader.

In a way, Barnett is spoiling her own story. There is no will they won't they. From their first meeting, it cuts to a moment that reveals that something must have happened. There is no build-up of emotions, The reader merely sees the aftermath of their choices. But what Barnett leaves out is imperative to keeping the reader interested. The reader knows what happens, but they don't know how it happened, and it is human nature to want to see the building burn, not just the ash.

Barnett also creates an interesting dynamic by never revealing Jonathan and Abby's spouses to us. There is dialogue with their children, but never their spouses. The reader is first introduced to Jonathan and Abby when they meet each other. The reader is bound to root for them because the reader has no intimate knowledge of their other lovers. This way the reader can feel the regret in the same way Jonathan and Abby do.

In conclusion, this story is strong in many aspects. The scenes are vivid and believable without sentences and sentences of description. The characters are flawed but real, and make the reader feel with them and for them. But the strongest aspect non-linearity and sky-high view. The story would lose its intrigue and uniqueness if it was not written this way.
