We want to know which variable appears to have the strongest association *with takeoff velocity*.

a.  Which variable is the response variable?

The takeoff velocity

b.  List the explanatory variables

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Sex      Body Mass (g)   Hind Limb Length (cm)   Muscle Mass (g)   Percent Body Fat
  -------- --------------- ----------------------- ----------------- ------------------

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

c.  Which variable has a positive association with *takeoff velocity* and which have a negative association?

Muscle Mass, body fat, body mass have negative associations

Hind limb length is positive association

d.  Which variable appears to have the strongest association with *takeoff velocity*? Justify

> Body Fat has the highest R\^2 of 0.4244 and therefore has the strongest association

e.  Describe the association between the variable in d. and *takeoff velocity*.

> As the body fat goes up the takeoff velocity goes down

f.  Compute the correlation *r* between the variable in d. and the *takeoff velocity*.

> R = 0.65146

g.  Write down the equation of the regression line between those two variables.

> y = -1.9534x + 397.65

h.  What is the intercept? Write a sentence to interpret the intercept.

> 397.65 Its what the takeoff would be if the body fat is 0

i.  What is the slop? Write a sentence to interpret the slope.

> -1.9534 As body fat increase by 1 the takeoff velocity decreases by 1.9

j.  Conclusion: Does the moderately strong correlation between the two variables imply the variable in d. is causing the slowdown in takeoff velocity? Justify.

> We conclude that it is at least one of the variables that is affecting takeoff velocity. It accounts for 42% of the points and this is much higher than any of the other R\^2s.
