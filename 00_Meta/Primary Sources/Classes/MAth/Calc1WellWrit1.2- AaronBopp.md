The monthly cost of driving a car depends on the number of miles driven. (Why?) Lynn found that in May it cost her \$380 to drive 480 miles and in June it cost her \$460 to drive 800 miles.

1.  Why would a linear model give a suitable model in this situation?

    a.  The car uses a certain amount of gas every mile it drives. There is some variance based on the terrain, but the price/mile ratio is consistent enough to have a constant slope. This cost also affected by the price of gas, which is represented by the y intercept.

2.  Define correctly variables *C* for the monthly cost and *d* for the miles driven in a month.

    a.  C(d) = monthly cost. For every mile driven the the cost is calculated based on all the factors in question 1.

    b.  d = miles driven. This is simply the variable that everything else gets based on. The more you drive the more the cost.

3.  Assuming that a linear relationship gives a suitable model, express the monthly cost *C* as a function of the distance driven.

    a.  C(d) = 1/4d + 260

4.  Use your model to in the above part to predict the cost of driving 1500 miles in a month.

    a.  \$635

5.  Draw a graph of the modeling function.

6.  What does the slope represent?

    a.  The slope represents the price per mile. Which is mainly how much gas the car uses per mile.

7.  What does the *C*-intercept represent?

    a.  The price of gas. This is a constant value that isn't effected by the car.

8.  What would be a reasonably be the domain for this function? (Why did you choose this domain?)

    a.  \[0,inf). Without any outside forces like friction, dust, rough driving, etc., the car could go forever. This won't be the case but it is impossible to predict when exactly a car will die. There are also unforeseen events like crashes that could end it early. I could base the domain of the average time a car dies, but I prefer to do it this way.
