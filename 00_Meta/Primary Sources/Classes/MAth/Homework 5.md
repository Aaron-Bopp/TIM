Homework 5

Birth weights of newborn babies in the USA can be modeled by a Normal curve with mean 3300 grams and standard deviation 570 grams.

a.  Are the measurements 3300 grams and 570 grams parameters or statistics?

They are parameters because they are about the whole not the sample.

b.  Draw the distribution of birth weights in the USA and label your graph

c.  Suppose you selected one new born (3800 grams) in the USA at random. How many standard deviation is this away from the center?

It is 0.877 standard deviations away from the median

d.  What the probability that the selected baby's weight is over 3800 grams?

There is a 18.9% chance that a babies weight will be over 3800 grams

e.  Now you plan on randomly selecting a sample of 120 babies and compute their mean weights$\ \overline{x}$. What is the sampling distribution of the mean$\overline{x}$? (Shape, center, spread, as always)

The mean is 3300 and the new standard deviation is 52. The shape is normal, unimodal,

f.  Draw the sampling distribution and label the horizontal axis in context.

g.  Shade the area corresponding to a sample mean exceeding 3800 grams. How many SD is this away from the center?

9.6 standard deviations away

h.  Calculate the probability that the sample mean exceeds 3800 grams.

3.5 x10\^-22, basically 0%

i.  Suppose we didn't know that the distribution of newborn weights was normal. Can you still calculate part c? How about part h?

You can not do it for part c but the dist of means in part h is always normal so you would always be able to calculate it.
