Homework 9

Download the real estate data and answer the following questions

1.  Sort the house prices by stories

2.  What is the mean for 2 story houses and the mean for 3 story houses?

Mean for 2 stories: 634072.9 Mean for 3 stories: 789820.2

3.  We would like to test whether 3 story houses are more expensive than 2 story houses. State the null and alternative hypothesis for the test.

H~o~ : Mean for 2 stories = mean for 3 stories

H~a~ : Mean for 2 Stories \< mean for 3 stories

4.  Check the conditions for the duplex prices and for the non-duplex prices (including drawing the histograms)

5.  Run an appropriate T-test: Write down the name of the test, the t statistics (how far is the statistic away from the center), and the p-value.

t-Test: Two-Sample Assuming Unequal Variances

T-stat is 2.2

P-value is very low 0.015

6.  State your conclusion:

The p-value is very low so from that we know it is unlikely. We also see that the mean for 3 story is 2.2 standard errors away from 2 story. Therefore we accept Ha and reject Ho.
