Homework 4.

I.  A random sample of 24 people participated in a "fantasy" baseball draft. The data in "FantasyDraftTimes "are the times (in seconds) that it took 24 people to make their selection.

```{=html}

```
1.  What is average and standard deviation of the sample of 24 people?

Average: 65.7 Standard Deviation: 8.8

2.  Estimate where the TRUE mean of how long it would take people to make a selection. (Construct a 95% [[confidence]] interval for the TRUE mean).

In the range (48.1, 83.3)

3.  Write your conclusion. In other words what does the 95% [[confidence]] interval mean?

That if you take many different samples of scores then the average will fall within that range 95% of the time.

4.  What happened to the margin of error if you consider 99% [[confidence]] instead of 95%?

It increases by one standard deviation on each side making the new [[confidence]] interval (39.3, 92.1)

II. Let *N*(100, 16) be the distribution of I.Q.'s.

```{=html}

```
1.  Where would the middle 95% of the population's I.Q.'s be?

(68, 132)

2.  What percent of people would have I.Q.'s below 68?

2.5%

3.  What percent of people would have I.Q.'s above 132?

2.5%
