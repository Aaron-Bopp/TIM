**Cryptocurrency**

Jarren Jackson, [[Christianity|Christian]] Jackson, Brady Kauffman

The number one problem with cryptocurrency is the scalability of the block-chain. This is the main reason why cryptocurrencies haven't been adopted globally as a mainstream currency. As of now, Bitcoin is only capable of 3 - 10 transactions per second, which is obviously not acceptable if it were to be adopted globally. Comparing this to Visa, which is able to process approximately 24,000 transactions per second, we can see a very large discrepancy between the two numbers. Once we are able to bridge this gap, we can provide a better currency globally. To combat this, we propose a solution called sharding. Sharding would take large block-chains such as Bitcoin and break its block-chain into smaller shards where each shard could share the overall load of the block-chain. This would ultimately reduce the query time and response time of accessing the block-chain. By doing this, we would also make it more widely available to people who don't have the resources necessary to operate a full node as less computational power would be required. This would result in a secure, anonymous, and fast form of currency that would be able to transcend borders allowing for a universally accepted currency which has never been implemented before.
