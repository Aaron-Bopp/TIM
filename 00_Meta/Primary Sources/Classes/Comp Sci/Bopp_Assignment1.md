Soft. Eng. Principles (Fall 2020)

Hw#1

Due Wednesday Sept. 9^th^, 2020

Ex#1 (10 pts)

List two Pros and two Cons of each of the following software development life-cycle processes.

1.  Waterfall model -- must complete every part before moving on

    a.  Pro: requirements are well known

    b.  Pro: integration one big bang at the end

    c.  Con: difficult to respond to changing customer requirements

    d.  Con: all requirements must be known upfront

2.  Incremental model -

    a.  Pro: easier to get customer feedback on work

    b.  Pro: cost of developing a system can be reduced

    c.  Con: products released may not have all functionality when released to client

    d.  Con: continued contact between client and team is required

3.  Integration and configuration model -- reusing components of existing applications in a system

    a.  Pro: Reduced costs and risk

    b.  Pro: Faster delivery

    c.  Con: you need existing systems and applications

    d.  Con: some components can be very expensive (licensing, etc)

4.  Spiral model

    a.  Pro: get big risks out of the way early

    b.  Pro: accommodates change

    c.  Con: lots of planning

    d.  Con: requires customer flexibility

5.  Scrum

    a.  Pro: constant development cycle allows flexibility in product delivery

    b.  Pro: plan-driven system, outputs are predicted in advance

    c.  Con: active customer involvement and team communication is required

    d.  Con: constantly changing requirements could prolong development

Ex#2 (10 pts)

Assume you are hired at the regional hospital in Maryville to work in the software engineering department. The software management system used in the hospital is based on the traditional such as the Waterfall software life cycle process where more rigid planning and documentation are required.

Discuss the pros and cons of switching to agile methodologies versus this traditional software model. You have been asked to focus on issues such as project size, team size, continuing multiple releasers over the years. You are also required to add other issues that you think are important.

The existing system was built with rigid documentation and system requirements but was most likely not built with the intention of being modified or built off of. An agile system would be built to be constantly changing and improving, its first iterations would be released quickly within the first few sprints. Agile allows for multiple teams to focus on one aspect or branch off too many different aspects based on what is needed, but in waterfall you need a large development team and a small maintenance team. If there is nothing to develop this large development team will have nothing to do and end up wasting money and time. Agile allows for smaller goals and a more efficient use of workers. The only cons of switching would be related to the healthcare industry, the possibility of agile releasing an incomplete project could be detrimental in a life or death situation.

Ex#3 (5 pts)

Explain how the incremental model is connected to the waterfall model. In other words, what is the connection between both models?

Every increment is just a small waterfall model. Both are linear processes and produce deliverable increments of software.

Ex#4 (5 pts)

Would it be possible to use one of the software life cycle models in open source systems development process. Assume there is no priori model framework. Justify your answer. Open source is used to mean more or less the same thing as free software. Free software is ''software that comes with permission for anyone to use, copy, and distribute, either verbatim or with modifications, either gratis or for a fee.''

Yes, but it depends heavily on what kind of open source it is. In large open source projects maintained by companies they most likely use agile or another process to develop it. In an open source that is maintained by large groups of independent programmers, they would each use their own method. Making it like a large agile process.
