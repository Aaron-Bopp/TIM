Network Fundamentals Homework Week 1 and 2

R3: Standards are important for protocols so that people can create networking systems and products that interoperate.

R8: Usually copper wire or fiber optics

R9: dial up -- 56Kbps, dedicated

ADSL -- 24 Mbps down and 2.5 Mbps up, dedicated

HFC -- 42.8 Mbps down 30.6 up, shared

FTTH -- 2-10Mbps up 10-20 Mbps shared

R11: the end-to-end delay is L/R1 + L/R2

R12: circuit switch has constant delays but packet switch can have varying delays. In FDM each circuit gets a fraction of the bandwidth. TDM each circuit periodicaly gets all the bandwidth

R14: ISPs peer to save money. IXPs earning money by charging the other ISPs fees

R16: processing, transmission, propagation are fixed delays, queuing are variable

R20: It breaks the file into smaller packets of information that include the order and destination of their arrival. Each time they get to a router they say where they are going and the router directs them

R23: top to bottom: application, transport, network, link, physical.

R27: A attacker gets a network of a bunch computers they can exploit through a vulnerability. Whenever they want they can use those computers to overload the target

P5: a. there is 6 minutes of processing delay at the toll booths and 90 minutes of travel delay = 96 minutes total delay

b\. 94 minutes and 48 seconds
