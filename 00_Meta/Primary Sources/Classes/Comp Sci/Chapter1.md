**Worksheet Chapter 1**

2.  Using the shorthand notation introduced in the chapter (see Figure 1-4), draw a single diagram to represent the following situation. A BANK has one or more BRANCHes (a BRANCH always belongs to exactly one BANK). Each BRANCH has one or more CUSTOMERs (but a CUSTOMER is assigned to only one BRANCH). Each CUSTOMER may own one or more ACCOUNTs, but each ACCOUNT is owned by only one CUSTOMER. Also each CUSTOMER may submit one or more TRANSACTIONs (but each TRANSACTION is submitted by one CUSTOMER). Finally, each ACCOUNT may have many TRANSACTIONs, and a TRANSACTION may be for more than one ACCOUNT.\*

3.  Using the notation from Chapter 1 (like in number 2 above), draw a single diagram that represents the following relationships in a hospital environment:

> A HOSPITAL has on its staff one or more PHYSICIANS.
>
> A PHYSICIAN is on the staff of only one HOSPITAL.
>
> A PHYSICIAN may admit one or more PATIENTS.
>
> A [[PATIENT]] is admitted by only one PHYSICIAN.
>
> A HOSPITAL has one or more WARDs. Each WARD is located in exactly one HOSPITAL.
>
> A WARD has any number of EMPLOYEEs. An EMPLOYEE may work in one or more
>
> WARDs.
>
> A CHARGE is incurred my one or more [[PATIENT]], and a [[PATIENT]] can incure more than one CHARGE.
