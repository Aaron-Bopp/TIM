**Dungeons and Dragons**

The E-R diagram for [[DnD]] will have the following entities. (If the person grading this plays [[DnD]] this isn't exactly how it is. Somethings have been simplified)

-   Campaign - Dungeon master prepares a story for players to play in. Each campaign must specify who the dungeon master is.

-   Player -- somebody who plays or has played [[DnD]]. Each player has a name as well as Experience which is how many years they have played and how many different campaigns they have played.

-   Character -- a character is a part of the story. A character has a name and a level. The character also has six different ability scores and an HP (health points) that is based off the level and the size of the HPDice from its class.

-   Class -- a class is the profession of a character. A class has a name and a list of traits and proficiencies. It also specifies the HPDice

-   Subclass -- a subclass supplements a class with an additional proficiency. A subclass is identified by its class and its name.

-   Background -- the background of a character. Has a name and a special ability.
