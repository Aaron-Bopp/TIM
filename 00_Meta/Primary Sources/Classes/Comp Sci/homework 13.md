Chapter 8 Review Problems

R1: confidentiality means an attacker cant interpret the message, integrity is if the receiver can tell if the message was changed in transit. they are independent of each other

R3: symmetric keys are the same for senders and receivers, public's are distinct and only the receiver has the decryption

R4: a known plaintext attack

R6: they need (n\*(n-1))/2 in a symmetric system, they only need 2n in a public system

R9: it is very difficult to find the hash for a message but the many checksums are the same

R10: a hash is one way, so no

R12: verifiable and non-forgeable means it was sent from where you think it was.

R14: false

R15: digital signature

R19: it has a digital signature

R24: false

R29: filter table (filters packets) and connection table (keeps track of connections)

R30:true

R33:true
