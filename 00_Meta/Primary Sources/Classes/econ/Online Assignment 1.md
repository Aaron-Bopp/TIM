#TO/EXPLORE/READ <https://www.manhattan-institute.org/reevaluating-prosperity-of-american-family> #TO/TEND/CONCEPTUALIZE old summary
Our measures of inflation do not give an accurate representation of the increase in cost of living. This is caused by quality adjustment(adding value does not increase inflation, even if the cheaper form is no longer available), risk sharing (new expensive procedure increases everyone's premiums), and social norms (backup cameras in cars). To address this, the author proposed the, "Cost-of-Thriving Index(COTI): the number of weeks of the median male wage required to pay for rent on a three-bedroom house at the 40th percentile of a local market's prices, a family health insurance premium, a semester of public college, and the operation of a vehicle."

d\) Discuss why you chose the article and how it relates to the course topic(s).

I find that GDP is an inaccurate measure of the success of our society. COTI is not perfect, but it provides and interesting look. I also like how it points out how housing, [[education]], and healthcare have inflated in ways that aren't measured in our normal metrics.

e\) React to the article---give your thoughts, opinions, comments, critique, etc.

I don't think COTI is a perfect measure, or really even as informative as inflation, but it provides an interesting analysis. It is harder to thrive now than it was in the past. This helps a narrow down on the reason why.
