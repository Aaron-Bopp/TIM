Online Assignment #5

**You will use the [[CIA]] World Factbook website to find and complete the following:**

-   Open this link to find the listing of countries ranked by per capita GDP: <https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/211rank.html#AF>

    -   Using this listing, choose 6 countries that you are interest in---2 high-income countries (>\$45,000 GDP per capita), 2 middle-income countries (between \$8,000 to \$20,000 GDP per capita), and 2 low-income countries (\< \$2,000 GDP per capita). Fill these countries and their per capita GDP into the table below.

    -   Now fill in the rest of the table using the [[CIA]] World Factbook data (<https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/af.html>) by choosing your country from the drop down menu that says "Please select a country to view".

        -   [[Unemployment]] rate and inflation rate can be found under the "[[economy]]" section. All other statistics can be found under the "People and Society" section.

-   If a statistic is not available for a particular country, just fill in N/A for that statistic. If a country has more than two N/As, please choose a different country.

-   Below the table, reflect on your findings.

Write a paragraph (minimum 5 sentences) reflecting on your findings:

I chose these countries for a few different reasons. I thought Liechtenstein would be interesting because of its small population and incredibly high GDP per capita. I feel like the negative interest inflation rate must be a fluke because of the large amount of money in the country, as they would still be affected by the inflation rates of the countries around it. I wish I could have found the physician density as I thought it would be quite high. [[China]] and North Korea I chose because of their totalitarian communist governments. I would think that the reason is that the physician density and [[unemployment]] rate of [[China]] being better than [[Iran]] could be because of CCP or possibly just because [[Iran]] was in [[war]] just a few decades ago. The super high physician density of North Korea feels like it must be [[propaganda]]. I am also surprised that North Korea's [[unemployment]] rate is so high, but it must be because of their low exports and natural resources compared to [[China]]. [[Afghanistan]] is the most [[war]] torn of the countries, but it still has a much higher fertility rate.
