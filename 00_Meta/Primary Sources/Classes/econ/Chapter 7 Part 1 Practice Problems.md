**Practice Problems (answers given below):**

1\. What are the four spending components of the expenditure approach to calculating GDP?

2\. For each of the following examples find: (1) which spending components of U.S. GDP are affected and by how much and (2) how much U.S. GDP increases.

> a\) A U.S. consumer purchases a shirt for \$25 that was produced in [[Vietnam]].
>
> b\) A grocery store in Nebraska purchases a new cash register for \$900 that was made in Texas.
>
> c\) The Missouri state [[government]] pays a teacher a salary of \$42,000.
>
> d\) A consumer in Maryville buys a new car for \$35,000 that was produced in Michigan.
>
> e\) The Maryville city [[government]] purchases new [[computer]] for \$1,000 that was made in [[China]].

3\. Suppose consumption spending is \$3.708 trillion, spending on nondurable goods is \$1.215 trillion, and spending on services is \$2.041 trillion. What does spending on durable goods equal?

**Answers:**

1\. consumption, investment, [[government]], and net exports

GDP = C + I + G +NX

2\. a) (1) Consumption (C): +\$25; Net exports (NX): -\$25

\(2\) U.S. GDP: unchanged

> b\) (1) Investment (I): +\$900
>
> \(2\) U.S. GDP: +\$900
>
> c\) (1) [[government]] (G): +\$42,000
>
> \(2\) U.S. GDP: +\$42,000
>
> d\) (2) Consumption (C): +\$35,000
>
> \(2\) U.S. GDP: +\$35,000
>
> e\) (1) [[government]] (G): +\$1,000; Net exports (NX): -\$1,000
>
> \(2\) U.S. GDP: unchanged

3\. Consumption spending = Durable goods spending + Nondurable goods spending + Spending on services

\$3.708 = Durable goods spending + \$1.215 + \$2.041

Spending on durable goods = \$0.452 trillion

**Practice Problems (answers given below):**

1\. Explain the difference between an increase in the QD of real GDP and an increase in AD.

2\. Based on the real balance effect, a decrease in the price level will cause \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in purchasing power, and therefore, total spending on goods and services (QD of real GDP) will \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

3\. Based on the interest rate effect, an increase in the price level will cause interest rates to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. This would cause people to borrow \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, and the QD of real GDP will \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

4\. Based on the international trade effect, when the U.S. price level rises relative to foreign price levels, foreign consumers will buy \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ U.S. goods.

5\. How will each of the following affect the AD curve?

a\) Interest rates decrease

b\) Consumer wealth decreases

c\) Foreign real national income increases

d\) Price level increases

6\. When the [[economy]]'s price level increases, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ will \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

a.  quantity demanded of real GDP; increase

b.  quantity demanded of real GDP; decrease

c.  aggregate demand; increase

d.  aggregate demand; decrease

7\. A shift to [[the left]] of the entire AD curve is called

a.  an increase in aggregate demand.

b.  a decrease in aggregate demand.

c.  an increase in quantity demanded of real GDP.

d.  a decrease in quantity demanded of real GDP.

**Answers:**

1\. An increase in the QD of real GDP is caused by a decrease in the price level and is reflected as a movement down and right along the AD curve. An increase in AD is caused by something other than a change in the price level and is reflected as a shift rightward of the entire AD curve.

2\. an increase; increase

3\. rise; less; decrease

4\. less

5\. a) AD shifts rightward

b\) AD shifts leftward

c\) AD shifts rightward

d\) Movement upward and left along AD curve (AD does not shift)

6\. b. quantity demanded of real GDP; decrease

7\. b. a decrease in aggregate demand.

**Practice Problems (answers given below):**

1\. How will each of the following affect the SRAS curve?

a\) Input prices increase

b\) Price level decreases

c\) Labor productivity increases

2\. Suppose there is a decrease in input prices. What effect will this have on the short-run equilibrium price level, real GDP, and the [[unemployment]] rate?

3\. Suppose the [[economy]] suffers an adverse supply shock. What effect will this have on the short-run equilibrium price level, real GDP, and the [[unemployment]] rate?

4\. Suppose the [[economy]]'s consumption spending decreases. What effect will this have on the short-run equilibrium price level, real GDP, and the [[unemployment]] rate?

5\. Suppose interest rates in the [[economy]] decrease. What effect will this have on the short-run equilibrium price level, real GDP, and the [[unemployment]] rate?

**Answers:**

1\. a) SRAS shifts leftward

b\) Movement downward and left along SRAS curve (SRAS does not shift)

c\) SRAS shifts rightward

2\. SRAS curve shifts to the right, causing equilibrium price level to decrease and equilibrium Real GDP to increase; [[unemployment]] rate will decrease

4\. AD curve shifts to [[the left]], causing both equilibrium price level and real GDP to decrease; [[unemployment]] rate will increase
