**Principles of Macroeconomics**

**Chapter 8 Part 2**

**Practice Problems (answers given below):**

1\. How will each of the following affect the SRAS curve?

a\) Input prices increase

b\) Price level decreases

c\) Labor productivity increases

2\. Suppose there is a decrease in input prices. What effect will this have on the short-run equilibrium price level, real GDP, and the [[unemployment]] rate?

3\. Suppose the [[economy]] suffers an adverse supply shock. What effect will this have on the short-run equilibrium price level, real GDP, and the [[unemployment]] rate?

4\. Suppose the [[economy]]'s consumption spending decreases. What effect will this have on the short-run equilibrium price level, real GDP, and the [[unemployment]] rate?

5\. Suppose interest rates in the [[economy]] decrease. What effect will this have on the short-run equilibrium price level, real GDP, and the [[unemployment]] rate?

**Answers:**

1\. a) SRAS shifts leftward

b\) Movement downward and left along SRAS curve (SRAS does not shift)

c\) SRAS shifts rightward

2\. SRAS curve shifts to the right, causing equilibrium price level to decrease and equilibrium Real GDP to increase; [[unemployment]] rate will decrease

3\. SRAS curve shifts to [[the left]], causing equilibrium price level to increase and equilibrium Real GDP to decrease; [[unemployment]] rate will increase

4\. AD curve shifts to [[the left]], causing both equilibrium price level and real GDP to decrease; [[unemployment]] rate will increase

5\. AD curve shifts to the right, causing both equilibrium price level and real GDP to increase; [[unemployment]] rate will decrease
