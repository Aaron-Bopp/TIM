**Principles of Macroeconomics**

**Chapter 8 Part 1**

**Practice Problems (answers given below):**

1\. Explain the difference between an increase in the QD of real GDP and an increase in AD.

2\. Based on the real balance effect, a decrease in the price level will cause \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ in purchasing power, and therefore, total spending on goods and services (QD of real GDP) will \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

3\. Based on the interest rate effect, an increase in the price level will cause interest rates to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. This would cause people to borrow \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, and the QD of real GDP will \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

4\. Based on the international trade effect, when the U.S. price level rises relative to foreign price levels, foreign consumers will buy \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ U.S. goods.

5\. How will each of the following affect the AD curve?

a\) Interest rates decrease

b\) Consumer wealth decreases

c\) Foreign real national income increases

d\) Price level increases

6\. When the [[economy]]'s price level increases, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ will \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

a.  quantity demanded of real GDP; increase

b.  quantity demanded of real GDP; decrease

c.  aggregate demand; increase

d.  aggregate demand; decrease

7\. A shift to [[the left]] of the entire AD curve is called

a.  an increase in aggregate demand.

b.  a decrease in aggregate demand.

c.  an increase in quantity demanded of real GDP.

d.  a decrease in quantity demanded of real GDP.

**Answers:**

1\. An increase in the QD of real GDP is caused by a decrease in the price level and is reflected as a movement down and right along the AD curve. An increase in AD is caused by something other than a change in the price level and is reflected as a shift rightward of the entire AD curve.

2\. an increase; increase

3\. rise; less; decrease

4\. less

5\. a) AD shifts rightward

b\) AD shifts leftward

c\) AD shifts rightward

d\) Movement upward and left along AD curve (AD does not shift)

6\. b. quantity demanded of real GDP; decrease

7\. b. a decrease in aggregate demand.
