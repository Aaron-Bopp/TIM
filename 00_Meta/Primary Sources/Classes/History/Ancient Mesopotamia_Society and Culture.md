            1.  Now the whole earth used the same language and the same words. **^2 ^**It came about as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. **^3 ^**They said to one another, "Come, let us make bricks and burn *them* thoroughly." And they used brick for stone, and they used tar for mortar. **^4 ^**They said, "Come, let us build for ourselves a city, and a tower whose top *will reach* into heaven, and let us make for ourselves a name, otherwise we will be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth." **^5 ^**The [Lord]{.smallcaps} came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men had built. **^6 ^**The [Lord]{.smallcaps} said, "Behold, they are one people, and they all have the same language. And this is what they began to do, and now nothing which they [[purpose]] to do will be impossible for them. **^7 ^**Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language, so that they will not understand one another's speech." **^8 ^**So the [Lord]{.smallcaps} scattered them abroad from there over the face of the whole earth; and they stopped building the city. **^9 ^**Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the [Lord]{.smallcaps} confused the language of the whole earth; and from there the [Lord]{.smallcaps} scattered them abroad over the face of the whole earth.

In fact, you sent \[the man\] Ilum-bani a half pound of gold! Which are the bracelets you left me? When you left, you didn't leave me an ounce of silver, you picked the house clean and took away everything! After you left, there was a sever famine in the city. Not so much as a quart of grain did you leave me, I always had to buy grain for our food. Besides that, I paid the assessment for the divine icon; in fact, I paid for my part in full. Besides that, I paid over to the town hall the grain owed \[the man\] Atata. What is the extravagance you keep writing me about? There is nothing for us to eat---we're the ones being extravagant? I picked up whatever I hand to hand and sent it to you---today I'm living in an empty house. It's high time you sent me the money realized on my weavings, in silver, from what you have to hand, so I can buy ten quarts of grain!"
