# American democracy's built-in bias towards rural (Republican?) areas

Its elections no longer convert the popular will into control of [[government]]

### [ Print edition \| Leaders](https://www.economist.com/sections/leaders) Jul 12th 2018

EVERY system for converting votes into power has its flaws. [[Britain]] suffers from an over-mighty executive; [[Italy]] from chronically weak [[government]]; [[Israel]] from small, domineering factions. [[America]], however, is plagued by the only [[democratic]] vice more troubling than the [[tyranny]] of the majority: [[tyranny]] of the minority. This has come about because of a growing division between rural and urban voters. The electoral system the Founders devised, and which their successors elaborated, gives rural voters more clout than urban ones. When the parties stood for both city and country that bias affected them both. But the [[Republican]] Party has become disproportionately rural and the [[Democratic]] Party disproportionately urban. That means a red vote is worth more than a blue one.

## The X factor

The consequences can be dramatic. In the three elections between 2012-16 [[Republican]] candidates got just 46% of the two-party vote for the Senate, and 49% of the popular vote for the presidency -- and yet Republicans control the Senate and the White House.

This imbalance is partly by design. The greatest and the smallest states each have two senators, in order that [[Congress]] should represent territory as well as people. Yet the over-representation of rural [[America]] was not supposed to affect the House and the presidency. For most of the past 200 years, when rural, urban and suburban interests were scattered between the parties, it did not. Today, however, the 13 states where people live closest together have 121 [[Democratic]] House members and 73 [[Republican]] ones, whereas the rest have 163 Republicans and just 72 Democrats. [[America]] has one party built on territory (the [[Republican]] Party) and another built on people (the [[Democratic]] Party).

The bias is deepening. Every president who took office in the 20th century did so having won the popular vote. In two of the five elections for 21st-century presidents, the minority won the electoral college only (and **[not]{.ul}** the popular vote). By having elected politicians appoint federal judges, the American system embeds this rural bias in the courts as well. Consider the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court. The justice, President Donald Trump's nominee duly confirmed by the [[Republican]]-run Senate, was appointed and confirmed by (Republican) politicians who were elected with less than half the two-party vote.

This bias is a dangerous new twist in the tribalism and political dysfunction that is poisoning [[Politics]] in Washington. [[America|Americans]] often say such partisanship is bad for their country (and that the other lot should mend their ways). The [[Founding Fathers]] would have agreed. George Washington warned that "the alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge...is itself a frightful despotism".

As a component of partisanship, the built-in bias is obviously bad for Democrats. But in the long run it is bad for [[America]] as a whole, including Republicans. When lawmaking is paralysed, important work, such as immigration and entitlement [[reform]], is too hard. The few big laws that are approved, like Barack [[Obama]]'s health-care [[reform]] or Mr Trump's corporate-tax cuts, pass on party-line votes. That emboldens the opposition to reverse or neuter them when they take power. Meanwhile, the task of resolving the most divisive political issues often falls to the courts. The battle over Mr Kavanaugh's confirmation will be a proxy [[war]] over issues, like [[abortion]] and health insurance, better suited to the legislature.

Some may ask why Democrats do not return to positions that appeal to rural voters (see our special report). Recall how Mr [[Obama]] won the presidency opposing [[Queer|gay]] marriage and [[Bill Clinton]] built a coalition in the centre-ground. But rancorous political disputes---over guns, [[abortion]] and climate change---split so neatly along urban-rural lines that parties and voters increasingly sort themselves into urban-rural tribes. Gerrymandering and party primaries reward extremists, and ensure that, once elected, they seldom need fear for their jobs. The incentives to take extreme positions are very powerful.

Bitter partisanship, ineffective federal [[government]] and electoral bias poison [[Politics]] and are hard to fix. Changing the constitution is hard---and rightly so. Yet the voting system for [[Congress]] is easier to [[reform]] than most people realise, because the constitution does not stipulate what it should be. [[Congress]] last voted to change the rules in 1967.

## Second thoughts about first-past-the-post

The aim should be to give office-seekers a reason to build bridges with opponents rather than torch them. If partisanship declined as a result, so would pressure on voters to stick to their tribe. That could make both parties competitive in rural and urban areas again, helping to restore majority rule.

One option, adopted in Maine this year and already proposed in a bill in [[Congress]] for use nationwide, is "ranked-choice voting" (RCV), in which voters list candidates in order of preference. After a first count, the candidate with the least support is eliminated, and his or her ballots are reallocated to those voters' second choice. This continues until someone has a majority. Candidates need second- and third-choice votes from their rivals' supporters, so they look for common ground with their opponents. Another option is multi-member districts, which were once commonplace and still exist in the Senate. Because they aggregate groups of voters, they make gerrymandering ineffective.

Voting [[reform]] is not the whole answer to partisanship and built-in bias, but it would help. It is hard, but not outlandish. To maintain the trust of all [[America|Americans]], the world's oldest constitutional democracy needs to [[reform]] itself.

**How to rig an election**

Apr 25th 2002 \| WASHINGTON, DC

From The Economist print edition

**In a normal democracy, voters choose their representatives. In [[America]], it is rapidly becoming the other way around**

IMAGINE a state with five congressional seats and only 25 voters in each. That makes 125 voters. Sixty-five are Republicans, 60 are Democrats. You might think a fair election in such a state would produce, say, three [[Republican]] representatives and two Democrats.

![](media/image2.png){width="3.6055555555555556in" height="2.9340277777777777in"}Now imagine you can draw the district boundaries any way you like. The only condition is that you must keep 25 voters in each one. If you were a [[Republican]], you could carve up the state so there were 13 Republicans and 12 Democrats per district. Your party would win every seat narrowly. Republicans, five-nil.

Now imagine you were a [[Democrat]]. If you put 15 Republicans in one district, you could then divide the rest of the state so that each district had 13 Democrats and 12 Republicans. Democrats, four-one. Same state, same number of districts, same party affiliation: completely different results. All you need is the power to draw district lines. And that is what [[America]] provides: a process, called redistricting, which, through back-room negotiations too boring for most voters to think about, can distort the [[democratic]] system itself.

All countries, in the interests of equal representation, adjust their electoral boundaries to reflect population changes. Most democracies hand over this job to independent commissions, which content themselves with tinkering with existing boundaries. In [[America]], in all but a few states, that idea sounds elitist and undemocratic. So every ten years, after the census, politicians in state legislatures meet to draw new voting maps which are approved by the state governor. Since America\'s population is both faster-growing and more mobile than that of other old democracies, and since the Voting Rights Act actually requires minorities to have special "majority-minority districts" in order to get an equal chance to elect candidates of their choice (ie, their race), redistricters end up doing a lot more than tinker.

# Voter Fraud Myths and Realities: Q&A

DEC 19, 2016 9:30 AM EST By [Francis Wilkinson](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/contributors/AQdiN7TnCuY/frank-wilkinson)

Richard L. Hasen, Chancellor's Professor of Law and Political Science at the University of California, Irvine, is a leading expert on U.S. election law. He runs the [Election Law Blog](https://electionlawblog.org/) and is the author of "[The Voting Wars](http://thevotingwars.com/)" and "[Plutocrats United: Campaign Money, the Supreme Court and the Distortion of American Elections](http://www.amazon.com/Plutocrats-United-Campaign-Distortion-Elections/dp/0300212453/ref=la_B0089NJCR2_1_7?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1430416698&sr=1-7)*.*" After President-elect Donald Trump made the [false claim](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/11/27/trumps-bogus-claim-that-millions-of-people-voted-illegally-for-hillary-clinton/?utm_term=.8e9171c781a3), in late November, that "millions of people" had voted illegally for Hillary Clinton, I asked Hasen to talk about the myths and realities of voter fraud.

**Wilkinson**: The entire issue of voter fraud is based on assumptions, isn't it? Many conservatives assume, without evidence, that fraud is widespread. Liberals counter with the assumption that since evidence doesn't exist, fraud doesn't either. How can you be sure that one assumption is superior to the other?

**Hasen**: I disagree with the premise of your question. Thoughtful people who have studied this issue (whether liberal or conservative) know that voter fraud is a real but very rare phenomenon. We do see occasional prosecutions for voter fraud, which usually involves the sale or theft of absentee ballots. People go to jail for this, as they do sometimes for voting in two jurisdictions (double voting).

However, cases of voter impersonation fraud, where one person goes to the polling place claiming to be someone else, are extremely rare. This is the kind of fraud that President Trump talked about in the run-up to the 2016 election, speaking of people voting 5, 10 or 15 times without detection. How do we know impersonation fraud doesn't exist in large numbers? To begin with, it would be an exceedingly dumb way to try to steal an election.

Trump beat Clinton by about 47,000 votes in Pennsylvania. Let's go back in time and say we wanted to flip this election. We would have had to find more than 4,700 people who each would have had to vote 10 times or more in Pennsylvania. We would have had to give them the names of more than 47,000 people who were listed on the voting rolls but were not going to show up to vote. And we would have had to pay those 4,700 people to vote even though we wouldn't be able to verify that they did, thanks to the secret ballot. Finally, all of them would have had to be silent about this. No word could get out. When you consider the level of difficulty it entails, you quickly realize that the entire idea is absurd.

We know other types of attempts at election fraud are not perfect crimes. People are caught each election somewhere in the country committing absentee fraud or trying to vote twice (although not 5, 10 or 15 times). Yet, at least since the 1980s, there are no examples of attempts or conspiracies to steal an election through impersonation fraud. We have only rare, isolated instances committed by individuals.

# America's unfair voting laws

A sweeping new report says the [[government]] must do more to protect minorities' right to vote

### [Democracy in America](https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica)

Sep 19th 2018 by C.K. \| WASHINGTON, DC

![](media/image5.png){width="4.605555555555555in" height="3.3979166666666667in"}IN ITS latest report on minority voting rights in [[America]], published this month, the bipartisan United States Commission on [[Civil Rights]] reports that a range of restrictive voting measures have been enacted by states in recent years. They range from laws demanding that voters produce specific forms of identification to reductions in the number of locations where people can cast their ballot. These laws have a disproportionate effect on the ability of minority groups to exercise their voting rights. And thanks to a 2013 Supreme Court decision that weakens federal authority to restrict such laws, they are remaining on the books.

The 1965 Voting Rights Act and its extensions helped dismantle generations of rules and regulations that had disenfranchised minority voters---and in particular black [[America|Americans]]. One of the act's major provisions mandated that jurisdictions with a history of voter rights discrimination, including Texas, North Carolina, and seven other states, had to "pre-clear" new voting requirements. This involved persuading the federal [[government]] or a three-judge panel that the requirements would not be discriminatory in impact. 

But in 2013, the Supreme Court struck down the pre-clearance process. The majority opinion suggested that the act had worked, and that it was hard to find continuing evidence of discrimination. In 1965, when the act was passed, the black-white enrolment gap in Mississippi, for example, was 7% to 70%. By 2004, that had reversed---the black enrolment rate was nearly 4% higher than white enrolment. The majority on the court took this as evidence that the pre-clearance process was no longer required.

But critics at the time noted that the court's argument that the act had worked was instead strong evidence of the risk to voting rights if it was dismantled. Their fears were quickly realised. Within two hours of the Supreme Court decision in 2013, Texas's attorney-general said the state would reinstitute a strict voter ID policy that had failed pre-clearance. A day later, North Carolina revised a bill to tighten its own ID laws. 

Both laws were later struck down by courts as discriminatory, but the process took years. Since the 2013 Supreme Court decision, [[civil rights]] groups and the federal [[government]] have had to file suit against potentially discriminatory voter laws after the fact, and the burden of proof is now upon them to demonstrate discriminatory impact. The Supreme Court also denied injunctions to delay implementation of the laws until after the cases were determined, with the result that the restrictions were operative during elections including the 2014 vote for federal House and Senate seats.

The passage of laws and regulations likely to disproportionately impact minority voters has taken off across [[America]]. Country-wide, the number of states requiring identification to vote has climbed from 14 in 2000 to 33 in 2016, for example. Nine states have introduced strict photo ID standards. Charles Stewart, a political scientist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has found that black and [[Latine|Latino]] voters are particularly likely to lack such ID, and are disproportionately likely to be asked for it at polling stations. 

The impact of new ID laws, voter purges and limits to voting times on actual votes cast by minority electors is complex to determine and debatable. But voter registration and turnout amongst blacks and Hispanics both dropped nationwide between 2012 and 2016, and while black turnout in North Carolina increased by 1.8% in 2014 compared to prior elections, that was a marked decline in the rate of growth over previous election cycles. 

Even if the size of the cost in terms of successful voter suppression is arguable, experts tend to agree that that such laws have few benefits. The major argument in favour of strict voting requirements is that they reduce significant voter fraud. But repeated attempts to measure the problem suggest fraud is extremely rare. In 2011 a survey by the [[Republican]] National Lawyers Association could find only one or two cases in each of 21 states over the period 2000-2010, for example. 

The Commission on [[Civil Rights]] Report is officially directed at the president, vice president and Speaker of the House. It is not clear how much these three [[Republican]] men will share the commission's concerns or seek to address the problem the report highlights. Just 14% of registered Hispanic voters and 3% of black voters identify as members of the [[Republican]] Party. And Mr Trump in particular has frequently reiterated his baseless theory that voter fraud is widespread.

# What if Election Day were a holiday?

**[Alia E. Dastagir](http://www.usatoday.com/staff/2283/alia-e-dastagir/), USA TODAY**Published 4:57 p.m. ET Feb. 1, 2019 \| **Updated 12:33 p.m. ET Feb. 4, 2019**

*Wondering if you can come in late or leave work early to cast your vote in an election? Well, in 30 states, you are actually allowed to leave to go cast your vote. According to [[Business]] Insider, currently, there is no federal law that mandates employers provide their employees time off to vote. But, the majority of US states have time-off-to-vote laws, also referred to as voter leave laws. So, it really depends on where you work so you need to check before you cast that vote.*

House Democrats introduced their first piece of legislation in the new [[Congress]] in February 2019, an [anti-corruption bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1/all-info) that proposed making Election Day a federal holiday  and encouraged private employers to give their workers the day off, too. 

Senate Majority Leader [Mitch McConnell dismissed the legislation on the Senate floor, calling it a \"power grab\"](https://amp.usatoday.com/story/2728121002) by Democrats. He was subsequently dragged by progressive lawmakers on Twitter, including Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who tweeted that \"voting isn't a \'power grab.\' It's democracy, and it's literally the entire point of our representative [[government]].\"  According to the Pew Research Center, [[America|Americans]] on both sides of the aisle support making Election Day a national holiday: [71% of Democrats and 59% of Republicans favor the idea. ](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/11/06/weekday-elections-set-the-u-s-apart-from-many-other-advanced-democracies/)

[[Civil rights]] and voting rights groups have been pushing for years to make Election Day a holiday, arguing it would allow working voters greater opportunity to cast their ballots. The measure has been included in several voting rights bills, including one in 2005 proposed by then New York Sen. Hillary Clinton, but they never passed. Numerous measures have been introduced by Republicans as well, [including a 1998 bill that tried to make it a holiday called "Freedom and Democracy Day." ](https://www.congress.gov/bill/105th-congress/senate-bill/1922?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22%5C%22election+day%5C%22%22%5D%7D&s=5&r=19) Despite what history suggests are long odds, USA TODAY spoke to four experts about what it would be like if [[America|the United States]] did actually have Election Day as a holiday. 

## [It could improve voter turnout ]{.ul}

\"Making election day a holiday would transform the culture around voting in our country and most inevitably improve turnout and participation rates across the board,\" said **Kristen Clarke**, president and executive director of the Lawyers Committee for [[Civil Rights]] Under Law. \"Enduring long lines, obtaining access to child care, finding the money to take public transportation to the polls are all real barriers that make it harder for people to exercise their voice on Election Day. By clearing away some of those hurdles, we would inevitably make it easier for people to participate.\"

![Advertisement](media/image6.gif){width="6.944444444444444e-3in" height="6.944444444444444e-3in"}[According to a United States Census Bureau survey](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/voting-and-registration/p20-580.html) of about 19 million registered voters who did not vote in the 2016 general election, 14.3 percent said busy schedules was the main reason they didn\'t cast a ballot. A little more than 60% of U.S. citizens cast ballots in the 2016 presidential election, according to Pew, and whites made up 73.3% of them. Those who did not vote[ \"were more likely to be younger, less educated, less affluent, and nonwhite."](http://www.people-press.org/2018/08/09/an-examination-of-the-2016-electorate-based-on-validated-voters/) 

Clarke said it\'s difficult to speculate whether Democrats or Republicans would benefit more from an election holiday, but she would expect to see some specific groups with higher participation rates. 

\"I think you would need real data over a few elections to make an assessment about partisan impact, if any,\" she said. \"But what I can say is that more working mothers, more young people, more low-income workers with long hours, more of our emergency personnel are all constituencies who we would see participating in higher rates if Election Day were a holiday.\"

In the 2016 presidential election, 53% of [[America|Americans]] making under 30,000 a year voted [[Democratic]] and 49% voted [[Republican]]. Among voters aged 18-29, 55% voted [[Democratic]] and 37% [[Republican]]. In the 2018 midterm elections, [67% of voters ages 18 to 29 favored the [[Democratic]] candidate.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/11/08/the-2018-midterm-vote-divisions-by-race-[[gender]]-education/)

## [It would put us in line with other democracies]{.ul}

Of the 36 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), [27 countries hold their national elections on a weekend.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/11/06/weekday-elections-set-the-u-s-apart-from-many-other-advanced-democracies/) [[Israel]] and South Korea hold theirs on weekdays but they\'re national holidays. \"We have among the lowest turnout rates of any modern democracy in the world today,\" Clarke said. In data analyzed by Pew, [the U.S. ranks 26th in voter turnout.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/21/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/)

## [It could make a statement about civic participation]{.ul}

**Holly Jackson**, an associate professor of English at the University of Massachusetts and the associate editor of *The New [[Britain|England]] Quarterly*, a peer-reviewed culture and history [[Journal]], says making Election Day a federal holiday would send a strong message about American values.

While Election Day was never an official federal holiday, it was once observed as a holiday in communities across the country, the date having been chosen to accommodate agricultural work schedules, she said. Many businesses closed for the day and some states declared an official holiday. \"The period of our history with the highest voter turnout rate was in the 19th century  ---from the 1840s-1890s --- when election days were not only holidays in the sense that people got a day off work, but were truly celebrated with big public gatherings, food and drink,\" she said. \"Even children too young to vote were involved in these festivities, which got them in the practice of civic participation and instilled a sense that it was important and fun.\"

\"Observing a holiday for Election Day is not only about allowing working people to access the polls --- although this is obviously an important consideration --- it's a starting point for creating a culture in which the [[democratic]] process is honored and celebrated.\"

**Justin Levitt**, a scholar of constitutional law and the law of democracy at Loyola University, agrees that an Election Day holiday would send a signal, but said it\'s not clear which party would benefit. 

\"I think the main impact of an Election Day holiday is not the notion that individual federal workers don't have to go to work, but the broader social stamp of seriousness on Election Day participation,\" Levitt said. \"The hope is that --- particularly in combination with the other opportunities to vote before Election Day, and to register on Election Day --- it would help to spur participation by those who vote less regularly at the moment. But especially in the Trump era, it's not clear whether those voters would likely be Republicans or Democrats.\"

## [It could nationalize what some states are already doing (but there\'s a catch)]{.ul}

Laws governing whether people get time off to vote vary widely across the country. Election Day [is a paid holiday for state workers in 13 states,](http://knowledgecenter.csg.org/kc/system/files/8.7.2018.pdf) according to Pew. Some states that allow time off to vote will penalize employers that keep workers from exercising that right. But in other states voters only get a limited amount of time to go to the polls, [according to Workplace Fairness](https://www.workplacefairness.org/voting-rights-time-off-work), and don\'t necessarily have to be paid if they do. In 20 states, you can be fired for taking time off to vote. 

Levitt, who served as deputy assistant attorney general in the Department of Justice\'s [[civil rights]] division under President Barack [[Obama]], says it\'s difficult to look at what states have done to increase voter turnout and make assumptions about how those changes would play out under a federal proposal. He said the impact of a state holiday on election day won't tell you much about the impact of a federal holiday, he said, in part because the \"real impact of a holiday is the social message --- and a federal holiday is a much stronger message.\"

In addition to making Election Day a federal holiday, the bill Democrats introduced would also promote automatic voter registration and early voting. These measures, which are getting less attention, are what create an \"election period\" rather than a single Election Day, and are the kinds of conveniences that may ultimately move the needle more than a holiday itself.

Levitt said it\'s also difficult to gauge a law\'s impact until you\'ve had a number of election cycles to observe changes in voter turnout. He uses the example of Georgia and Indiana, both of which passed strict voter ID laws between 2004 and 2008, which critics feared would deter minority voters. The opposite happened.

\"If you just look at turnout from 2004 to 2008, it skyrocketed, particularly among African [[America|Americans]]. But if you were to give an honest answer as to why, you would have to say, \'I have no idea,\' because there are so many intervening factors,\" Levitt said, pointing to the fact that both were battleground states and that [[Obama]] was the first African-American major party candidate in 2008.

There are some states where changes in election rules have led to increases in voter turnout, but it would be difficult to say how those changes would translate to the country unless the demographics of that state (or states) reflected the demographics of the nation as a whole.

Oregon, for example, has been lauded for its voting-by mail [[reform]], adopted in 1998 and which has seen several election cycles. [A 2008 study in the Social Science Quarterly](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23523998_Voting_by_Mail_Turnout_and_Institutional_Reform_in_Oregon) found Oregon\'s voter turnout increased by around 10 percentage points of registered voters in both presidential and mid-term elections due to the [[reform]]. In 2014, Oregon, alongside Colorado and Washington --- three \"vote-at-home\" states --- averaged a 65-percent turnout compared to 48 percent in other states.

But Levitt said he isn\'t sure you\'d see the same impacts in a place like Texas or Florida, which have a much different socioeconomic and demographic makeup.

## [It could reduce confusion ]{.ul}

**Paula Brantner**, a senior advisor at Workplace [[Fairness]], says state laws that govern voting rights vary so widely, most people don\'t even know what protections they have on Election Day. She said the Workplace [[Fairness]] website, which serves as a clearinghouse of information about workers\' rights, gets between 2.5 to 4 million visitors a year, and the biggest spike in visitors is on Election Day.

\"People are scrambling to find out this information \... and unfortunately sometimes you have to notify your employer in advance, and you\'ve lost your window of opportunity to do that,\" she said.

In Tennessee for example, employees are given time off to vote unless their workday begins more than three hours after polls open or ends more than three hours before polls close. 

\"What about carpool, and getting your kid to school? Even those three hours may not be enough,\" Brantner said. \"What if you already have an hour and a half commute to work? Or the polling place is in the opposite direction of where you have to go?\"

# 7 specific ways states changed voting in 2016 

## Those long early voting lines aren't a total accident.

By [German Lopez](https://www.vox.com/authors/german-lopez)[\@germanrlopez](https://www.twitter.com/germanrlopez)<german.lopez@vox.com>  Nov 7, 2016, 1:20pm EST

1.  **Voter ID requirements:** [**Alabama**](https://www.alabamavotes.gov/VoterID.aspx?m=voters), [**Mississippi**](http://msvoterid.ms.gov/), [**New Hampshire**](http://sos.nh.gov/voterid.aspx), [**Rhode Island**](http://sos.ri.gov/divisions/elections/Voters/voter-id), [**Virginia**](http://www.elections.virginia.gov/registration/photo-ids-required-to-vote/), [**South Carolina**](https://mgtvwcbd.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/southcarolinavoteridtoolkit.pdf), [**Tennessee**](https://www.tn.gov/safety/topic/photoids), [**Texas**](http://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/pamphlets/largepamp.shtml), and [**Wisconsin**](http://elections.wi.gov/elections-voting/photo-id) passed new laws that require voters prove their [[self]] with a voter ID. [**Indiana**](https://www.brennancenter.org/voting-restrictions-first-time-2016) also passed a law letting party-nominated election officers demand voter IDs at the polls. The laws can severely limit which IDs are valid --- Texas, for example, allows a gun permit and other [[government]]-issued IDs but not a student ID. Some states allow exceptions to their laws, but the process of obtaining an exception can be arduous, especially for poor, time-constrained voters.

2.  **Early voting cuts:** [**Ohio**](http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/23/politics/ohio-golden-week-early-voting/) cut a whole week from early voting, eliminating the "golden week" in which voters could register and vote** **on the same day. And [**Nebraska**](http://netnebraska.org/node/1048431) cut its early voting period from 35 days to no more than 30 days.

3.  **New requirements to register to vote:** [**Kansas**](http://www.dmv.org/ks-kansas/voter-registration.php) passed a law that requires new voters to show proof of citizenship to register to vote. [**Virginia**](http://www.elections.virginia.gov/registration/registration-drives/index.html) also required groups submitting 25 or more voter registration forms to register with the state, and reduced the amount of time to deliver the forms from 15 days to 10 days.

4.  **Limits on mail-in ballots:** [**Arizona**](http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/11/04/us-court-blocks-arizona-ban-groups-collecting-ballots/93300560/) made it a felony to collect and turn in someone else's mail-in ballot, even with that voter's permission. [[America|The US]] Supreme Court recently [**let the law stand**](http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/04/politics/arizona-ballot-collection/index.html) for 2016.

5.  **Provisional and absentee voting changes:** [**Ohio**](http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/10/31/husted-asks-supreme-court-to-deny-paring-back-ohio-voting-rules.html) passed strict rules that can invalidate absentee and provisional ballots if forms accompanying those ballots aren't filled out in a very specific way.

6.  **Polling place closures:** Southern states, from Arizona to North Carolina, have [**closed down**](http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/4/13501120/vote-polling-places-election-2016) at least 868 polling places since [[America|the US]] Supreme Court [**struck down**](http://www.vox.com/cards/voting-rights-fight-explained/what-was-shelby-county-v-holder) part of the Voting Rights Act in 2013. (The Voting Rights Act could have allowed the Department of Justice to stop these closures before, but not anymore.) These are only the closures tracked in about half the counties that were once covered by the Voting Rights Act due to their long histories of racial discrimination, so there have likely been hundreds or even thousands more closures nationwide.

7.  **Voter roll purges:** Several states have attempted to conduct sweeping purges of voter rolls if a voter has not cast a ballot in recent elections, potentially undoing voters' registration without their knowledge. Some of these purges --- such as [**North Carolina's**](http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/5/13533936/north-carolina-voter-purge-court) and [**Florida's**](http://www.projectvote.org/press-releases/florida-purge-program-was-illegal-rules-federal-court/) --- have been overturned by courts, but not all are even known to the public until it's too late.

Due to socioeconomic disparities, these types of restrictions disproportionately impact minority voters. For example, since minority [[America|Americans]] are less likely to [**have flexible work hours**](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516588&xs=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs10834-007-9090-7) or [**own cars**](http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~raphael/BerubeDeakenRaphael.pdf), they might have a harder time affording a voter ID or getting to the right place (typically a DMV or BMV office) to obtain a voter ID, rely more on early voting opportunities to cast a ballot, or require a nearby voting place instead of one that's a drive, instead of a walk, away from home or work.

The impact of these voting restrictions isn't normally enough to swing a national election. [**Studies**](http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/2/13481816/voter-id-suppression-turnout) show that restrictions like voter ID and early voting cuts tend to have little to no effect on voter turnout. But when an election is very close --- as is the case in North Carolina, which reduced the number of polling places this year --- even a small impact could make a significant difference.

That's especially the case if the restrictions target minority [[America|Americans]] --- since they tend to vote [[Democrat]], keeping them from the ballot box could give Republicans an advantage. [**Studies**](http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/10/31/13478134/voter-fraud-id-2016-trump), [**court findings**](http://www.vox.com/2015/8/6/9106055/north-carolina-voting-rights), and [**Republicans' own admissions**](http://www.vox.com/2016/9/2/12774066/voter-id-laws-racist) suggest that the new voting restrictions disproportionately impact, often purposely so, minority voters.

# Senate Report: Russians Used Social Media Mostly To Target Race In 2016

October 8, 20192:50 PM ET

![](media/image7.jpeg){width="3.0062554680664917in" height="2.255318241469816in"}Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., (left) and Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., released a new report on how [[Russia|Russians]] used social [[media]] targeting to meddle with the 2016 election.

*J. Scott Applewhite/AP*

The Russian government\'s interference in the 2016 U.S. elections singled out African [[America|Americans]], a [new Senate committee report](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report_Volume2.pdf) concludes.

Using Facebook pages, Instagram content and Twitter posts, Russian information operatives working for the [[Internet]] Research Agency had an \"overwhelming operational emphasis on race \... no single group of [[America|Americans]] was targeted \... more than African [[America|Americans]].\"

That was evident throughout the IRA\'s Facebook content, the report said, citing the fact that over 66 percent of that content contained a term related to race.

And using ads with location targeting \"principally aimed at African-[[America|Americans]] in key metropolitan areas,\" the Russian information operations focused on pages like Blacktivist, which garnered 11.2 million engagements with Facebook users.

The report, written by the [[Republican]]-led Senate Intelligence Committee, also said the [[Internet]] Research Agency, which worked \"at the direction of the Kremlin,\" increased its activity after Election Day in 2016.

Following the 2016 election, \"Instagram activity increased 238 percent, Facebook increased 59 percent, Twitter increased 52 percent, and YouTube citations went up by 84 percent,\" the report found.

The committee\'s work also affirmed the conclusions of earlier investigations on Russian interference in the elections, including the Mueller report\'s findings and the Jan. 6, 2017, Intelligence Community Assessment.

\"The Committee found that IRA social [[media]] activity was overtly and almost invariably supportive of then-candidate Trump,\" the report reads. \"The Committee found that the Russian [[government]] tasked and supported the IRA\' s interference in the 2016 U.S. election.\"

The Senate committee found that the [[Internet]] Research Agency sought to harm [[Democrat]] Hillary Clinton and support Donald Trump \"at the direction of the Kremlin.\"

And the study also concluded that the IRA sought to focus on socially divisive issues like race to pit [[America|Americans]] against one another.

The results of the report are part of an ongoing investigation into Russian election interference first launched by the Senate Intelligence Committee in 2017.

### [2020 Election: Secure Your Vote](https://www.npr.org/series/754498433/secure-your-vote-2020-election-security)

\"By flooding social [[media]] with false reports, conspiracy theories, and trolls, and by exploiting existing divisions, [[Russia]] is trying to breed distrust of our [[democratic]] institutions and our fellow [[America|Americans]],\" Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr said in a written statement.

The recommendations of the report include better coordination between social [[media]] companies, as well as more information sharing between Big Tech companies and the [[government]].

The report also recommends that [[Congress]] pass legislation that requires that tech platforms disclose who paid for online political advertisements and that the executive branch form an interagency task force to monitor foreign use of social [[media]] for [[democratic]] interference.

# Election Officials To Convene Amid Historic Focus On Voting And Interference

January 27, 20205:21 AM ET [PAM FESSLER](https://www.npr.org/people/2100470/pam-fessler)

Top election officials from all 50 states are meeting in Washington this week to prepare for 2020 --- a gathering amid widespread concern over whether the upcoming elections will be fair and accurate, as well as free of the kind of foreign interference that marred the 2016 campaign.

Despite major [[government]] efforts to upgrade security, an [NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/21/797101409/npr-poll-majority-of-[[America|americans]]-believe-trump-encourages-election-interference) found that about 41% of [[America|Americans]] surveyed do not think the country is prepared to protect the U.S. election system from another attack.

Voters also say their biggest concern is disinformation, followed by voter fraud and voter suppression. Forty-four percent think it\'s likely that many votes will not actually be counted in 2020. While most voters have [[confidence]] in their state and local governments to run a fair election, 43% do not think those officials have done enough to make sure that there\'s no foreign interference. Many more blame President Trump. Fifty-six percent say he has done little or nothing to keep the elections safe. A slim majority think the president, who has repeatedly questioned Russian tampering in 2016, actually encourages foreign interference.

This lack of voter [[confidence]] has unnerved lower-level election officials as the nation heads into what\'s expected to be a highly contentious presidential race with high levels of turnout. \"My biggest concern in 2020 is that regardless of outcome, we will be faced with somewhere around the end of the first week in November, this concern by half of the country that they lost the election illegitimately, \" says Colorado Election Director Judd Choate. Choate is one of the officials who will be gathering in Washington to discuss ways to address the threat.

**Gamut of fears**

Most of those who run elections believe the biggest danger is not someone tampering with actual votes --- although that is a concern --- but causing enough confusion to undermine public trust in the process. Officials are preparing for a range of possibilities, including disruption of voter registration systems, social [[media]] disinformation campaigns, ransomware attacks and even power outages. But Choate and other officials hope a number of changes made since 2016 will help boost voter [[confidence]].

States have spent hundreds of millions of dollars beefing up security and purchasing new voting equipment. Some 90% of voters, many more than in 2016, will cast their votes on paper ballots, which are immune from cyber-mischief and can be audited later to verify that results were accurate. Election officials have also been working closely with the U.S. intelligence community and other federal agencies to tighten security and share information about potential threats.

Christopher Krebs, leader of the Cybersecurity and [[Infrastructure]] Security Agency within the Department of Homeland Security --- charged with helping to secure the nation\'s election [[infrastructure]] --- says he isn\'t surprised that voters are worried about what might happen this year. But Krebs thinks they should be more confident than some say they are. \"The federal [[government]] is working together on this singular issue, election security, frankly better than any other issue that I\'ve ever seen,\" he says.

**The red team**

Officials at all levels of [[government]] have conducted countless training sessions, vulnerability assessments and tabletop exercises since 2016. Another tabletop training is scheduled with top state election officials this week in Washington. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose says he\'s on the phone with federal security officials almost every day. \"Whether it\'s myself personally or a member of our IT team, we work with DHS hand in glove,\" he says. Security preparations have involved all partners in elections, including voting equipment vendors, which are also seen as potential targets.

Sam Derheimer, director of [[government]] affairs for Hart InterCivic, one of the main suppliers of voting equipment in the country, recalls an incident last year that he says illustrates the improvement in coordination. One of the company\'s customers, an election official in a small Texas county, received a phone call from someone pretending to be from Hart who asked about sensitive security measures and tried to get the official to log into unfamiliar websites. \"She didn\'t know the person on the other side of the phone, and red flags were raised immediately,\" says Derheimer.

### [FBI Vows To Warn More Election Officials If Discovering A Cyberattack](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/16/797102287/fbi-vows-to-warn-more-elections-officials-if-discovering-a-cyberattack)

The local official immediately called the company with her concerns. Hart then contacted the Department of Homeland Security, which issued an alert through an information-sharing group that includes election officials and vendors around the country. \"It really laid out the incident as best we knew it --- what had occurred and what to be wary of in the future,\" says Derheimer, \"because if it happened to this one local election official, it easily could have occurred to others.\" It turns out that the woman was unknowingly the target of a security firm hired by her county to test its cyberdefenses. For those who run elections, the quick national response was a promising sign that everyone is much more attuned to potential threats than they have been in the past. \"An election official --- \[who\] three or four years ago would have probably just blindly and blithely followed the instructions --- now is like, \'Wait a second. That doesn\'t sound right,\' \" says Krebs.

**Spreader of doubt**

Still, the push to tighten election security and boost public [[confidence]] has been complicated by Trump\'s downplaying of the foreign threat and his repeated claims, without evidence, that voter fraud is rampant. Former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff thinks Trump\'s remarks are \"unhelpful\" --- imagine, he asked, how much difference it might make if the president were on the same page as his advisers and local election officials. \"A president who got out there and really encouraged investment in the security would be again a positive factor.\" But, adds Chertoff, \"I think that it\'s not deterring the people who are actually doing the work from carrying it out.\"

Shelby Pierson, the election threats executive within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, was asked by NPR point-blank whether she has to try to work around Trump. No, she said. And for his part, Krebs insists that he has all the support and guidance he needs from the White House to do his job. \"We all know what\'s at stake here,\" he says. \"And it\'s defending democracy. It\'s protecting 2020, and I think the American people need to have [[confidence]] that we take this seriously.\"

Krebs warns, though, that there\'s no such thing as 100% security and that the threat is evolving. While [[Russia|Russians]] conducted the attacks in 2016, intelligence officials expect that attacks this year could come from others as well, including [[Iran]], [[China]] or some domestic player.

### [Congress Allocates \$425 Million For Election Security In New Legislation](https://www.npr.org/2019/12/16/788490509/congress-allocates-425-million-for-election-security-in-new-legislation)

Krebs says voters also have a security role to play by making sure they know where to vote and how and what their rights are if something does go wrong at the polling place. He also says voters should make sure they get their information about elections from trusted sources and not believe everything they see on social [[media]]. \"We\'ve got to be prepared and resilient as a people, as a democracy, as voters, to not let someone else, not let the [[Russia|Russians]], not let the Iranians, not let someone else decide the outcome of this election,\" he says. \"American voters should decide American elections, and that\'s why we\'re putting as much effort into this as we are.\"
