**2019 Preliminary Semiannual Uniform Crime Report Released**

January 21, 2020 \-- Violent and Property Crime Show Decrease from 2018 Statistics

![](media/image1.jpeg){width="3.5267858705161856in" height="1.6024748468941383in"}Preliminary statistics show overall declines in both violent and property crime in the first half of 2019 compared to the same time frame the previous year, according to FBI crime statistics released today.

The [*Preliminary Semiannual Uniform Crime Report*](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/preliminary-report/home) covers January through June 2019. It contains data from more than 14,000 law enforcement agencies nationwide that voluntarily submitted information to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program.

According to the report, all categories of violent crime offenses decreased between the first half of 2018 and the first half of 2019, including:

-   Robbery (-7.4 percent)

-   Rape (-7.3 percent)

-   Murder and nonnegligent manslaughter (-3.9 percent)

-   Aggravated assault (-0.3 percent)

Property crime also declined during the same period, specifically:

-   Burglary (-11.1 percent)

-   Motor vehicle theft (-6.7 percent)

-   Larceny-theft (-4.2 percent)

The full *Crime in [[America|the United States]], 2019* report will be released later this year.

# Rethinking Mass Incarceration in America

A new book challenges the popular understanding of how the U.S. [[prison]] population skyrocketed.

[MATT FORD](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/matt-ford/) MAR 2, 2017

Stop me if you've heard this one before: Starting in the 1970s, U.S. policymakers embraced draconian criminal-justice policies as part of the [[war on drugs]]. Tough-on-crime politicians rose to power by pledging longer mandatory-minimum sentences and more intense policing practices. The American legal system became the primary tool for addressing the nation's social ills. And as incarceration grew rapidly in the following decades, so, too, did the coffers of an emerging [[prison-industrial complex]].

That's what John Pfaff, a law professor at Fordham University in New York, calls the "standard story" of mass incarceration. But in his new book *Locked In*, Pfaff offers a different account of the phenomenon's origins. Instead of the [[war on drugs]], he points to violent crime as the key factor that fueled [[America]]'s exceptional incarceration rate. Public-employee unions and rural politicians, not just the private-[[prison]] industry, trumpeted the boost in jobs and help to small-town economies that large penitentiaries can provide. And prosecutors, not judges or legislators, made the crucial decisions that gave [[America|the United States]] the world's largest population behind bars.

Revisiting mass incarceration's causes involves more than historical study---it also means reassessing both the utility of recent [[reform]] efforts and the path activists take next. I spoke with Pfaff about his research, the conclusions he drew, and what they could mean for the future of criminal-justice [[reform]]. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

**Matt Ford:** What do you think we're getting wrong about mass incarceration?

**John Pfaff:** I think it's less that we're getting something wrong, and more that we're paying too much attention to secondary causes and ignoring more fundamental causes. So what I argue is that it's not the [[war on drugs]], it's not longer sentences, it's not private prisons---none of those things are irrelevant, they all matter, but we overemphasize their importance. As a result, we don't pay enough attention to prosecutors, to violent crimes, to public-sector unions, and to the politicians. So it's more about reframing how we look at it rather than saying we're looking at the wrong thing.

**Ford:** In your book, you describe those overemphasized aspects of mass incarceration as the "standard story" of its origins. Why has that narrative become so dominant?

**Pfaff:** There are several reasons. Part of it, I think, was sort of out of necessity. After 40 years of steady, unrelenting [[prison]] growth, we weren't going to start pushing back on that by passing a be-lenient-towards-murderers bill. Drugs was a natural place to start pushing back against mass incarceration, so I think part of it was understandable and a justifiable political necessity.

Part of the problem is that we tend to talk a lot about the federal system. Federal [[prison]] sentences are about half drugs and the states are about 16 percent drugs, but the feds get a tremendous amount of attention. *Vox* [had a survey a couple of months ago](http://www.vox.com/2016/9/7/12814504/mass-incarceration-poll) in which they asked people, "Do you think about a majority of people in [[prison]] nationwide are there for drugs?" And a majority of liberals, moderates, and conservatives all said yes. As for the focus on private prisons over the public sector, I think that probably reflects the political biases of the early reformers, who tend to be more liberal and tend to distrust the private sector.

The failure to pay attention to prosecutors, that's the one I find hardest to understand---why they've been able to skate through the cracks for so long. Part of it is just that we don't have data on prosecutors the way we do on policing and judging and sentencing---but then again, maybe we don't really have data on them because we don't focus on them. I'm not sure which is the chicken and which is the egg there. But they occupy this sort of middle area. They're not the ones out there with the sirens and the badges that get our attention on the front end. They're not the ones in the courtroom announcing sentences, the way we view judges culturally in the criminal-justice system. So they somehow manage to escape detection.

**Ford:** Your focus on prosecutors really stood out to me because we usually think of mass incarceration as the product of judges and legislatures. But you're telling us to look at the district attorney's office instead?

**Pfaff:** Exactly. My own empirical work is constrained to the 1990s onward, just because of the data that's available. But at least during that period, when [[prison]] populations continued to rise even as crime steadily fell, the one thing that seemed to drive that growth was an increased willingness on the part of prosecutors to file felony charges against people who were arrested. We're arresting fewer and fewer people over that time, and charging more and more people with felonies. Once they're charged with a felony, the probability they went to [[prison]] didn't change and the time they spent in [[prison]] didn't change. But the risk of your arrest turning into that felony case grew substantially.

**Ford:** So in a way it sounds like activists don't have one criminal-justice system or 50 systems to [[reform]], they have about 3,000 of them, one for each county with a prosecutor, then?

**Pfaff:** Yes and no. There's policing that we have to [[reform]], and that's at the city level, so it's even more of those---about 17,000 or 18,000 law-enforcement agencies. There's reforming of prosecutors---that's not quite one per county, but there are about 2,500 prosecutors' offices. There are some parole reforms you can make, and that's a state-level change. So each stage requires work, and I think it's important to stress that the term "criminal-justice system" is very misleading. What we have is not a system at all, but a patchwork of competing bureaucracies with different constituencies, different incentives, who oftentimes might have similar political ideologies, but very different goals and very different pressures on them.

**Ford:** Does that make [[reform]] less likely to succeed? I mean, if activists don't have a single system to target, are they less likely to effectively marshal resources to change it?

**Pfaff:** There are two reasons to be fairly optimistic. First is that while there are over 2,000 prosecutors' offices, over 60 percent of all felony cases are processed by the 11 percent that are in the counties with 250,000 people or more. The majority of cases are managed by some 200 or so prosecutors' offices, so it's more manageable to have a big impact. You can accomplish a lot with a small number of these districts. The other thing is the decentralization: On the one hand, it does make work harder, you have to go to more places, but it can also be protective in that one bad decision or one bad approach at the very top has a much harder time percolating down.

It's why, at least on the [[prison]] side, I remain fairly optimistic that [[reform]] will keep pushing ahead despite the Trump and \[Attorney General Jeff\] Sessions administration. It's hard for D.C. to sort of push the system in one direction or the other because there's no single system for it to push on. And there's reason, I think, to be optimistic that local efforts are working. 2016 was a very interesting election cycle because at the same time that a large number of [[America|Americans]] voted for Donald Trump, with his very 1980s-style tough-on-crime rhetoric, about 20 or so tough-on-crime prosecutors were voted out of office and were succeeded by [[reform]]-minded challengers.

**Ford:** How does the [[war on drugs]] play into this? In the standard story, it's a central feature, but it seems less focal in the view you offer.

**Pfaff:** If you define the [[war on drugs]] as arresting people for drug offenses, then as it stands right now, only about 16 percent of all people in state [[prison]] are there on a drug charge. The increase in sending people to [[prison]] for drugs explains about 20 percent of all [[prison]] growth between 1980 and 2010, so it's not the dominant driver. What a majority of people are in [[prison]] for are for crimes of violence, so at some point we have to start confronting how we punish people for violent crimes.

And I think that does point to one risk of our standard-story approach: By emphasizing the [[war on drugs]] and telling people we can accomplish [[reform]] by decarcerating people for drug offenses, we don't encourage them to think about how to punish violence differently. In that same *Vox* survey that showed a majority of [[America|Americans]] think a majority of prisoners are there for drugs, a more disturbing question they asked was something like, "Are you willing to punish those who are convicted of violence and pose little threat of recidivism, are you willing to punish them less?" And a majority of liberals, moderates, and conservatives said no, that they are unwilling---even for those who pose a low risk of recidivism---they're unwilling to contemplate punishing those convicted of violence less.

I think we've convinced people that we can really impose deep cuts just by focusing on the safe, easy cases of the nonviolent drug offender. And the fact is, any sort of deep cut in our [[prison]] population will require us to reduce the number of people in [[prison]] for violence. And I think we can do that and maintain public safety. One statistic that doesn't get enough attention is that our violent crime rate right now is about where it was in 1970---it might be even better than that depending on which numbers you use---but our incarceration rate is five times higher. So unless you think [[America|Americans]] are five times more violent today than in 1970, that's hard to justify. And if anything, I'd say the crime-age American citizen today is probably less violent than the same person in the 1970s, so it's even harder to justify that way.

**Ford:** If I'm a state legislator who's worried about being painted as soft on crime, and I'm worried about all the traditional political attacks that go with it, what steps could I take to reduce the number of people in [[prison]] for violent offenses that would be safe and equitable and just?

**Pfaff:** One thing they could focus on would be expanding parole options for people convicted of violence. Often when we see states push to expand parole choices, more often than not they explicitly exclude those convicted of a current violent offense, or sometimes even any prior violent offense**. **And that's kind of [[self]]-defeating, because the fact is our popular model of violent behavior is not really accurate. We tend to use the term "violent offender." I work very hard to never use it if I can, because it defines someone who commits a violent act as that's who they are: They are a violent person, it's a state of being. And violence isn't a state of being, it's at most a phase. People also age into and age out of crime. Someone who commits a violent crime when they're 16 isn't going to be nearly as violent when they're 30 or 35. There's hormonal changes, there's cultural changes, social changes---you get married, you have a job, and that helps you desist from offending. We tend to lock them up for longer periods of time just as they're aging out of crime.

So the thing a legislator could do is expand parole options for people who have been convicted of violence and stop excluding violent crimes from eligibility. But I think the central role violent crimes have played in [[prison]] growth suggests that this isn't necessarily something legislators can fix for us. These are not acts that we necessarily want the legislature to decriminalize, and even current sentence lengths aren't that long. The median time in [[prison]] of someone convicted of violence remains about four to four-and-a-half years. That's a long time in [[prison]], but not some staggeringly long sentence.

I think what it points to is a greater need on the part of prosecutors to either use their discretion better or for us to figure out ways to channel or limit their discretion so they're not quite so aggressive, to rely on [[prison]] less, and focus more on preventative approaches that prevent the violence from happening in the first place.

**Ford:** One of the themes that really struck me throughout your book was sort of the statistical gaps we have---especially about prosecutors but also about other parts of the criminal-justice system. How does that shape how we understand criminal justice itself, as well as the efforts to [[reform]] it?

**Pfaff:** It's important to stress that however weak our data is on policing and prisons and crime, our data on prosecutors is almost nonexistent. There's no centralized data set on what they do, and most of the offices don't provide information of a meaningful sort themselves, so you have almost no idea what they do. And from a policy point of view, that makes it hard for us to regulate them. It makes it hard for voters to make careful decisions about what the DA is doing and whether they support that policy or not. From a policymaker's perspective, it means that we don't really know how legal changes will actually play out in practice.

**Ford:** We've seen a lot of states experimenting with various criminal-justice reforms in recent years. Are there many states where you think they're much more accurately addressing the causes of mass incarceration---looking at violent crime, looking at prosecutors---than others?

**Pfaff:** When it comes to violent crime, very little. But one state that does deserve credit is actually Mississippi, which is, as far as I can tell, the only state I've seen that actually explicitly cut time served for people convicted of violence. Like many states, Mississippi had what's called a truth-in-sentencing law that said for certain categories of offenses, often for violent crimes, an inmate must serve a minimum of 75 percent of the sentence before he's parole-eligible. And a couple of years ago, they actually cut that back from 75 percent of the sentence to 50 percent of the sentence, and that was just for people convicted of violence.

But you see very little of that. More often you see the exact opposite. Even states that have gotten praise for their reforms, like South Carolina, what they often do is agree to cut time served for drug and property crimes, or raise the threshold for a felony so they move how much you have to steal for felony theft---but then they pair it with an increase in punishment for violent offenses. So they sort of say, "We'll cut sentences for the nonviolent crimes to free up space for people convicted of violence, and we'll increase the sanctions for violent offenses." It's happened in South Carolina, it's happened in Maryland, it's happened in other places. I wouldn't say it's backwards, but it's concerning, because while the cuts for the property and drug offenses make sense and are laudable, we also need to start figuring out how to cut back on violent crimes, and we're doing the exact opposite.

When it comes to prosecutors, I've seen nothing by any state that really aggressively goes after them. California's very complicated realignment approach, which was their response to [the Supreme Court's ruling on the Ninth Circuit's overcrowding litigation](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/05/the-supreme-court-declares-californias-prisons-overcrowded/239313/), has had an impact on prosecutors. They told counties that if you convict someone of what's called a "triple non"---a nonviolent, non-serious, non-sexual offense---even if he's supposed to go to [[prison]] for years and years, you have to keep him imprisoned in the county jail. And what that does is have important---and I would say somewhat boring---budgetary implications. One reason why prosecutors can be so tough on crime is that they are county officials, but prisons are paid for by the state. So if you convict someone of a felony and send them to the state, your county doesn't pick up the cost, the state does. So being tough on crime is actually financially free and political popular.

Jails, on the other hand, where we send people convicted of misdemeanors, those are paid for by the county. So what California's basically said is that for these triple nons, the county has to pay for their incarceration, not the state, which undermines to some extent this free-riding opportunity that prosecutors had. It's complicated, it's imperfect, but that's the only real effort I've seen that affects prosecutors. I think more consistent with what we see towards them was Hillary Clinton's end-to-end criminal-justice-[[reform]] plan that talked about policing and talked about parole and completely ignored the prosecutor, didn't mention it once. To me, it wasn't so much end-to-end as it was end-and-end. It got the ends, but it missed that critical middle of the prosecutor.

**Ford: **Activists enjoyed a few years under the [[Obama]] administration where they had a combination of low crime and bipartisan support to really try to change the conversation. Now that there's a president who's willing to be not only as vocally tough on crime as politicians during the peak era, but also in some cases even more so---does that change the dynamic for criminal-justice reformers and how they should look at the other aspects of the system you mentioned?

**Pfaff:** I'm less concerned about Trump's rhetoric and more concerned about the actual uptick in violent crime we've seen over the past two years. Here's why I'm somewhat less concerned about Donald Trump than I think many people are: Partly, like I said, I think it's the localism that's what matters---that decisions being made are being made by local prosecutors and they respond to their own local interests. So there's not much that Trump can do to move them one way or the other.

I think the example that I find most striking for this isn't a federal one, it's actually a state one, which is the Rockefeller drug laws. In 1973, New York passed some of the harshest drug laws in the country. \[Governor Nelson\] Rockefeller passed them to appear tough on crime in his effort to do a sort of end-run on the right as part of his national political aspirations.

Yet what's interesting is that shortly after these laws were passed, there was a slight uptick in New York state prisons for drugs---but then it drops. And by 1984, 11 years after the laws were passed, there were actually fewer people in New York state prisons for drugs than there were in 1973 when the laws were adopted. So New York passes these tough drug laws, the governor is using them as a statement to show he is tough on crime---and all the local prosecutors just ignore them. Then, in 1984, the number of people in [[prison]] for drugs starts to rise, and rises precipitously for the next 10 or 12 years. That's not just drugs, that's crack. When the crack-related violence broke out across New York and the rest of the country, the prosecutors responded by using the drug laws as one way to target that violence.

And then the number of people in New York state prisons for drugs starts to drop in 1999, years before the first [[reform]] law. When those [[reform]] laws were passed, there's no change in the decline of the number of people in [[prison]] for drugs in New York. So basically what happened is the New York City DAs who led this decline had decided to stop sending people to [[prison]] for drugs independent of what was happening in Albany.

What that story tells me is that DAs are very local and they'll respond to local conditions. If crime is going up, they will become tougher. And it will look perhaps like Trump's rhetoric is pushing it, but I think it's more that if things get tougher, Trump's rhetoric will be a mirror of the underlying changes, not so much the cause of them.

And I would say that even if crime is going up, I don't think that means we should turn more to incarceration. Even if violent crime is rising, there are other, far better options that we can and should use, and I think reformers need to get out ahead of that. Oftentimes we see a lot of the big [[reform]] groups saying, "Look, don't worry, crime isn't going up that much, it's not really going up at all, we can still reduce prisons and reduce violence," and that troubles me because that ties [[prison]] [[reform]] to low crime.

The fact is that whether crime is high or low, [[prison]] is not the most efficient way to respond to it, and I think we need to start telling a story that there are better ways---even if violent crime is rising, say, "Look, even if this is a real upward trend, [[prison]] is not what is going to rein it in. We can do this much better, much more smartly, in a much less costly way by focusing on well-established interventions that are good at disrupting violence."

# America's prisons are failing. Here's how to make them work

A lot is known about how to [[reform]] prisoners. Far too little is done

### [Print edition \| Leaders](https://www.economist.com/sections/leaders) May 27th 2017

![](media/image2.png){width="5.272222222222222in" height="2.4256944444444444in"}SHIRLEY SCHMITT is no one's idea of a dangerous criminal. She lived quietly on a farm in Iowa, raising horses and a daughter, until her husband died in 2006. Depressed and [[suffering]] from chronic pain, she started using methamphetamine. Unable to afford her habit, she and a group of friends started to make the drug, for their own personal use. She was arrested in 2012, underwent drug treatment, and has been sober ever since. She has never sold drugs for profit, but federal mandatory minimum rules, along with previous convictions for drug possession and livestock neglect, forced the judge to sentence her to ten years in [[prison]]. Each year she serves will cost taxpayers roughly \$30,000---enough to pay the fees for three struggling students at the University of Iowa. When she gets out she could be old enough to draw a pension.

Barack [[Obama]] tried to reduce the number of absurdly long [[prison]] sentences in [[America]]. His attorney-general, Eric Holder, told federal prosecutors to avoid seeking the maximum penalties for non-violent drug offenders. This [[reform]] caused a modest reduction in the number of federal prisoners (who are about 10% of the total). Donald Trump's attorney-general, Jeff Sessions, has just torn it up. This month he ordered prosecutors to aim for the harshest punishments the law allows, calling his new crusade against drug dealers "moral and just". It is neither.

More is not always better

Prisons are an essential tool to keep society safe. A burglar who is locked up cannot break into your home. A mugger may leave you alone if he thinks that robbing you means jail. Without the threat of a cell to keep them in check, the strong and selfish would prey on the weak, as they do in countries where the state is too feeble to run a proper justice system.

But as with many good things, more is not always better (see [article](http://www.economist.com/news/international/21722654-world-can-learn-how-norway-treats-its-offenders-too-many-prisons-make-bad-people)). The first people any rational society locks up are the most dangerous criminals, such as murderers and rapists. The more people a country imprisons, the less dangerous each additional prisoner is likely to be. At some point, the costs of incarceration start to outweigh the benefits. Prisons are expensive---cells must be built, guards hired, prisoners fed. The inmate, while confined, is unlikely to work, support his family or pay tax. Money spent on prisons cannot be spent on other things that might reduce crime more, such as hiring extra police or improving pre-school in rough neighbourhoods. And---crucially---locking up minor offenders can make them more dangerous, since they learn felonious habits from the hard cases they meet inside.

[[America]] passed the point of negative returns long ago. Its incarceration rate rose fivefold between 1970 and 2008. Relative to its population, it now locks up seven times as many people as [[France]], 11 times as many as the Netherlands and 15 times as many as [[Japan]]. It imprisons people for things that should not be crimes (drug possession, prostitution, unintentionally violating incomprehensible regulations) and imposes breathtakingly harsh penalties for minor offences. Under "three strikes" rules, petty thieves have been jailed for life.

A ten-year sentence costs ten times as much as a one-year sentence, but is nowhere near ten times as effective a deterrent. Criminals do not think ten years into the future. If they did, they would take up some other line of work. One study found that each extra year in [[prison]] raises the risk of reoffending by six percentage points. Also, because mass incarceration breaks up families and renders many ex-convicts unemployable, it has raised the American [[poverty]] rate by an estimated 20%. Many states, including Mr Sessions's home, Alabama, have decided that enough is enough. Between 2010 and 2015 [[America]]'s incarceration rate fell by 8%. Far from leading to a surge in crime, this was accompanied by a 15% drop.

[[America]] is an outlier, but plenty of countries fail to use [[prison]] intelligently. There is ample evidence of what works. Reserve [[prison]] for the worst offenders. Divert the less scary ones to drug treatment, community service and other penalties that do not mean severing ties with work, family and normality. A good place to start would be with most of the 2.6m prisoners in the world---a quarter of the total---who are still awaiting trial. For a fraction of the cost of locking them up, they could be fitted with GPS-enabled ankle bracelets that monitor where they are and whether they are taking drugs.

Tagging can also be used as an alternative to locking up convicts---a "[[prison]] without walls", to quote Mark Kleiman of New York University, who estimates that as many as half of [[America]]'s prisoners could usefully be released and tagged. A study in Argentina finds that low-risk prisoners who are tagged instead of being incarcerated are less likely to reoffend, probably because they remain among normal folk instead of sitting idly in a cage with sociopaths.

Justice systems could do far more to rehabilitate prisoners, too. Cognitive behavioural therapy---counselling prisoners on how to avoid the places, people and situations that prompt them to commit crimes---can reduce recidivism by 10-30%, and is especially useful in dealing with young offenders. It is also cheap---a rounding error in the \$80 billion a year that [[America]] spends on incarceration and probation. Yet, by one estimate, only 5% of American prisoners have access to it.

The road to rehabilitation

Ex-convicts who find a job and a place to stay are less likely to return to crime. In Norway prisoners can start their new jobs 18 months *before* they are released. In [[America]] there are 27,000 state licensing rules keeping felons out of jobs such as barber and roofer. Norway has a lower recidivism rate than [[America]], despite locking up only its worst criminals, who are more likely to reoffend. Some American states, meanwhile, do much better than others. Oregon, which insists that programmes to [[reform]] felons are measured for effectiveness, has a recidivism rate less than half as high as California's. Appeals to make prisons more humane often fall on deaf ears; voters detest criminals. But they detest crime more, so politicians should not be afraid to embrace proven ways to make [[prison]] less of a school of crime and more of a path back to productive citizenship.

# Congress discovers a bill with bipartisan support that the president signed

###  Print edition \| United States Dec 15th 2018\| WASHINGTON, DC

Tough, anti-crime rhetoric has been part of Donald Trump's public persona for decades. Well before he ran for office, in 1989, he took out full-page ads in New York papers that said, "Muggers and murderers...should be forced to suffer, and when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes." He announced his candidacy by inveighing against Mexicans "bringing crime", then courted support from rank-and-file police officers. His first attorney-general, Jeff Sessions, was a hoary drug warrior who reversed Justice Department efforts to help police departments [[reform]] and to send fewer people to [[prison]]. William Barr, Mr Sessions's prospective replacement, has similar views. In 1994 he chaired a commission in Virginia that recommended longer imprisonment and the [[abolition]] of parole.

But Mr Trump has also been receptive to personal arguments against harsh criminal-justice policies. At the urging of Kim Kardashian, a fellow reality-television star, he commuted the life sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old woman imprisoned for money laundering and drug trafficking. And at the urging of his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, he has become an unlikely champion of the First Step Act, a criminal-justice bill with bipartisan support. Reversing an earlier decision, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said he would bring it up for a vote before the end of 2018. Despite gripes from some on the right who deem it too soft on criminals, and some on [[the left]] who feel it does not go far enough, its passage looks likely. That's right: a bipartisan bill will probably make it through [[Congress]] and then be signed by the president.

The First Step Act is a sentencing-[[reform]] bill that repeals some of the harsher federal laws passed in the 1980s and 1990s. In 2010 [[Congress]] passed the Fair Sentencing Act, which among other things reduced the sentencing disparity between convictions for crack and powdered cocaine. The First Step Act would make that measure retroactive, allowing nearly 3,000 offenders imprisoned for crack-cocaine offences to petition judges for early release.

It would also reduce the mandatory-minimum sentence for serious drug felonies from 20 to 15 years, and for conviction on a third drug-trafficking or violent felony from life to 25 years. Judges would have more discretion to sentence people with minor previous convictions to less than the mandatory minimum (at present they can exercise that discretion only for non-violent drug offenders with no criminal history). According to an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office, more than 2,000 people a year would be affected by that "safety valve" expansion.

Prisoners would no longer be sent to facilities more than 500 miles from their homes, and pregnant prisoners would no longer be shackled. The bill allows some prisoners, though not those convicted of most violent crimes, to earn time off their sentences by participating in rehabilitative programmes, and it expands federal funding for job-training and educational programming in prisons. More elderly and terminally ill prisoners would be eligible for compassionate release. And all prisoners would be able to reduce their time in [[prison]] by up to 54 days per year of their sentence for good behaviour. The Brennan Centre, a think-tank and advocacy group, estimates the bill would result in the release around 5,000 prisoners and shorten sentences for roughly 100,000 more.

Though welcome, this would only nibble at the [[prison]] population. Roughly 2.2m people are imprisoned in [[America]]. Less than 10% of them are in federal prisons, and federal prisoners are the only ones affected by the First Step Act's reforms (see chart). Still, Inimai Chettiar of the Brennan Centre calls the bill "a good compromise"---the resigned view held by many advocates of criminal-justice [[reform]]. Given the rhetoric of Mr Trump and policies set by Messrs Sessions and Barr, it is probably as much as anyone could hope for from this administration. It may also encourage Democrats, particularly those eyeing a presidential run, to argue for bolder reforms.

![](media/image3.png){width="4.170833333333333in" height="2.9444444444444446in"}Even this modest change has its critics. Jonathan Thompson, executive director of the National Sheriffs' Association, calls the bill "a giant social experiment," and argues for "rational [[prison]] [[reform]] that doesn't just let people out hoping they won't recidivate." Tom Cotton, a [[Republican]] senator from Arkansas who has previously said that [[America]] has "an under-incarceration problem," blasted the First Step Act for allowing "early release for many categories of serious, violent criminals".

Yet while carjackers and bank robbers would indeed be eligible for sentence reduction by completing job-training and educational programmes, Mr Cotton is conflating "early release" with "early transfer to pre-release custody". The federal [[prison]] system does not just wash its hands of violent criminals who manage to chip away at their sentences; they are instead sent to halfway houses, home confinement with ankle-monitoring and other types of supervised, conditional release.

NOTE: The First Step Act passed the [[Republican]]-controlled House in May 2018 by 360 votes to 59, and passed the Senate 87-12 later that year. President Trump signed the bill into law on December 21^st^, 2018.

# The troubling spread of plea-bargaining from America to the world

*A tool for making justice swifter too often snares the innocent* Nov 9th 2017

In plea-bargaining, as the promise of a lesser penalty in return for a guilty plea is commonly known, prosecutors offer to drop some charges, to replace the original charge with a less serious one or to seek a lower sentence. It has long been central to [[America]]'s criminal-justice system. But over the past three decades it has spread across the world. A study of 90 countries by Fair Trials International, a campaigning group, found that in 1990 just 19 used some form of plea-bargaining. Now 66 do.

Plea-bargaining took off in [[America]] around 1920 with Prohibition, which led to a steep increase in the number of criminal offences. By 1930 the number of federal prosecutions under the Prohibition Act alone was eight times the total figure for all federal prosecutions in 1914. Bargaining with defendants to plead guilty in return for lighter punishment seemed like the only way to cope. Prohibition ended in 1933, but plea bargains did not. Since 1970, when the Supreme Court ruled that they were permissible, they have become ubiquitous. In 1980 some 19% of federal defendants went to trial. In 2010 the share was below 3%, where it remains.

The strong arm of the law: When [[America]]'s Supreme Court gave its seal of approval to plea bargains in 1970, it did so on the understanding that they would not be used to press innocent defendants falsely to admit [[guilt]]. But since then a series of miscarriages of justice and new psychological research suggest that, all too often, that is what happens.

In 2002 Brian Banks, a high-school football player, was accused of rape and kidnapping by an acquaintance. After his arrest, prosecutors offered him the chance to plead guilty and spend just a few years in jail, or to go to trial where he could face up to 41 years if convicted. He took the deal. After he was released, his alleged victim contacted him. They met and, in a conversation which he recorded, she admitted that she had invented the incident. In 2012 he was exonerated.

Mr Banks is not alone in pleading guilty to a crime he did not commit. Of the 149 [[America|Americans]] absolved of crimes in 2015, 65 had pleaded guilty. The Innocence Project, an organisation that uses DNA evidence to re-examine convictions, has proven the innocence of 300-odd people, most of them convicted for rape and murder. At least 30 had pleaded guilty. According to the National Registry of Exonerations, a collaboration between several law schools, a quarter of [[America|Americans]] cleared of murder between 1989 and 2012 had confessed. But such figures only hint at the scale of the problem. Often, plea bargains are conditional on giving up the right to challenge a conviction later.

...In [[America]], prosecutors have broad freedom to slash sentences, including for crimes that carry the death penalty. The extensive use of plea-bargaining can reshape an entire criminal-justice system. By definition, it means fewer trials---and therefore fewer occasions on which police and prosecutors must make a solid case in an open courtroom. The ability to carry out investigations can atrophy. And statutes that are vague or unjust may go unchallenged because so few cases go to trial.

For defendants who plead guilty, the consequences go beyond any (reduced) sentence they must serve or fine they must pay. In [[Europe]] criminal records are usually wiped clean of all but the most serious offences after some time, provided people do not re-offend. In the meantime, however, sensitive jobs such as teaching or public administration are likely to be off-limits. And minor transgressions, such as traffic offences, may be punished more harshly.

In many American states the consequences are more severe and long-lasting. Criminal records may never be expunged and may mean being barred from voting, evicted from public housing, denied welfare or turned away when applying for a job. The extra legal restrictions placed on people with criminal records, some bizarrely specific, mean they are more vulnerable to future charges. In Illinois, for example, it is a crime to own a dog that has not been spayed or neutered---but only for people with a criminal record.

# The Dangerous Domino Effect of Not Making Bail

[[America]]'s money-bail system mostly traps low-level offenders who can't afford their freedom while awaiting trial.

**[CHERISE FANNO BURDEEN](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/cherise-fanno-burdeen/)** APR 12, 2016

...Most of the 12 million jail bookings in [[America|the United States]] each year are for low-level, nonviolent charges. Yet far too many of these defendants remain in jail while awaiting their day in court because they cannot afford money bail. More than 60[ percent of people](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/jim14.pdf) locked up in [[America]]'s jails have not yet been to trial, and as many as [nine in ](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fdluc06.pdf)10 of those people are stuck in jail because they can't afford to post bond. They are presumed innocent until proven guilty, according to a bedrock principle of the justice system. Low-risk defendants charged with offenses like shoplifting or traffic violations often wait in jail for days, months, or[ even years](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/09/nyregion/kalief-browder-held-at-rikers-island-for-3-years-without-trial-commits-[[suicide]].html) for a trial. But that's the reality of the current justice system, one that spends nearly [\$14 billion](http://www.safetyandjusticechallenge.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/The-Price-of-Jails-report.pdf) a year on pretrial confinement.

The system often seems indifferent to the damage pretrial detention can cause. This was illustrated in the Department of Justice's[ Ferguson Report](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/ferguson_police_department_report.pdf), which found that some court systems not only fail to give credit for time served pretrial, but also don't even track the total time a person has spent in jail as a part of a case. When asked why this was not tracked, a member of the court staff n Ferguson told the Department of Justice, "It's only three days anyway."

But three days count. Even short-term incarceration can have dire consequences. People can lose their jobs, housing, even custody of their kids if they're in jail. Studies also show pretrial detention makes otherwise low-risk defendants more likely to commit new crimes and less likely to appear in court. Spending the full pretrial detention period in jail also makes a person more likely to be sentenced to jail or [[prison]] and for a longer time---effectively adding to the problem of mass incarceration. These harms are not shouldered evenly. Blacks, Latinos, and Native [[America|Americans]] are [twice as likely](https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/Abstract.aspx?id=204620) to be stuck in jail because they cannot afford money bail. This is in no small part because they face higher bail amounts on average than white defendants with similar charges. All this harm can happen even if a person is eventually found innocent or the charges are dismissed. The other side to this dysfunction is that [about half](http://www.pretrial.org/download/research/Developing%20a%20National%20Model%20for%20Pretrial%20Risk%20Assessment%20-%20LJAF%202013.pdf%E2%80%9D) of the most dangerous defendants exploit the money-bail system, often with assistance from for-profit bail bondsmen, to come up with the cash that lets them leave jail unencumbered by monitoring or supervision by the courts. 

Many jurisdictions already know how to replace outdated pretrial justice policies like cash bail with risk-based systems that are safer, fairer, and more effective. The District of Columbia instituted reforms in the 1990s that effectively replaced cash bail with a [pretrial risk assessment program ](https://www.psa.gov/?q=about%E2%80%9D)that evaluates which defendants are too risky to be released. The highly effective program doesn't demand cash bail; instead defendants are assessed for their likelihood to appear for their trial and potential impact on public safety. Most defendants are released on their own recognizance or under minimal supervision, and only about [15 percent of defendants](https://www.psa.gov/?q=node/390) are held in jail. D.C.'s model has an [89 percent](http://www.csosa.gov/about/financial/budget/2014/FY14-PSA-Budget-Submission.pdf) court appearance rate, which is comparable to what is seen elsewhere under cash bail. The model is being adopted in a growing list of other jurisdictions, including, mostly recently, the state of New Jersey.

The damage money bail causes is serious enough---and the solutions so within reach---that pretrial [[reform]] should be a priority. States can improve the laws that govern pretrial detention, and counties can implement risk assessment and right-sized supervision for those who need it. More and more legislators, activists, and state leaders are following the example of [Colorado](http://www.pretrial.org/download/risk-assessment/CO%20Pretrial%20Assessment%20Tool%20Report%20Rev%20-%20PJI%202012.pdf), [Kentucky](http://www.pretrial.org/download/infostop/Pretrial%20Reform%20in%20Kentucky%20Implementation%20Guide%202013.pdf), and dozens of other places that have already begun implementing smarter pretrial justice practices. There are different strategies for realizing these changes. The non-profit civil-rights organization[ Equal Justice Under Law](http://equaljusticeunderlaw.org/wp/current-cases/ending-the-american-money-bail-system/) has been successfully using the equal-protection clause to challenge the constitutionality of money bail. Many jurisdictions, like [Connecticut](http://portal.ct.gov/uploadedFiles/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/Press_Room/Press_Releases/2016/01-2016/2016.01.28%20Gov%20Malloy%20Second%20Chance%202-0.pdf), are championing bail [[reform]] through legislative action. In February, Representative Ted Lieu of California introduced the[ No More Money Bail Act of 2016](https://lieu.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-ted-w-lieu-introduces-no-money-bail-act-2016-0), which would give states three years to replace money bail with risk-assessment alternatives or face the loss of federal funds for common justice programs and initiatives.

# A 'Constitutional Crisis' in Missouri

In a class-action lawsuit filed Thursday, a group of defendants argued the state's public-defender system is too underfunded and overworked to meet the Sixth Amendment's standards.

**[MATT FORD](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/matt-ford/)** MAR 14, 2017

When the ACLU filed a class-action lawsuit against Missouri's struggling public-defender system on Thursday, Michael Barrett wasn't surprised.

"We\'ve been jumping up and down trying to call attention to this matter for the last two years, telling the state, 'This is coming, this is coming,' although we didn\'t know precisely when it would come," Barrett, the director of the Missouri State Public Defender Office, told me Friday. "It was inevitable, just given all the studies that have been done regarding our caseload and the limited number of lawyers the state gives us."

The lawsuit, filed on behalf of five Missourians in the state's criminal-justice system, accuses public defenders of failing to provide poor defendants with their constitutionally guaranteed right to legal counsel. The 53-page complaint depicts an overwhelmed system in which a too-small cadre of lawyers is burdened with too many cases and, as a result, too little time to properly defend their clients in court.

"For more than two decades, Defendants have failed to provide the resources required to adequately represent poor people accused of crimes in Missouri, leading to the actual and constructive denial of counsel for, and ineffective representation of, indigent defendants across the State," the lawsuit claims.

Barrett echoed similar sentiments on the problems facing his office. "A lawyer can probably only handle 40, maybe 50 case at any one time," he explained. "Our lawyers have three times that amount, and people are taking pleas because they\'re sitting in local jail waiting for their lawyer to get to them." With so little time spent on each of their many clients, lawyers are often unable to conduct interviews, review evidence, or pursue avenues of investigation that could be crucial to their defense.

Under the Sixth Amendment, everyone who enters the American criminal-justice system has the right to adequate legal counsel. Two landmark decisions by the Warren Court in the 1960s gave force to that promise. First, the justices unanimously ruled in *Gideon v. Wainwright* that states must provide a lawyer if a defendant cannot afford one, effectively mandating the creation of modern public-defender systems. Four years later, in *In re Gault*, the Court held that juvenile defendants are entitled to the same due-process rights as adults, thereby imposing the same requirement on the juvenile-justice system.

But more than a half-century after the Warren Court's [[revolution]] in criminal justice, the plaintiffs' stories offer a window into how Missouri's system falls short of that promise. A public defender told Shondel Church, one of the plaintiffs, he'd have to wait six months in jail before his lawyer could help him beat his felony theft charge. Church pled guilty to misdemeanor theft after three months instead. Brian Richman's lawyer waived Richman's right to appear before a judge with counsel for some hearings in a felony drug-charge case without consulting Richman first.

One of the most startling cases cited in the lawsuit is that of Randall Lee Dalton, who was charged with felony possession of a controlled substance after police raided the nursing home where he lived in January. Officers found a single pill of Lorazepam and arrested him for it, then discovered he had an outstanding warrant for writing a bad check and had failed to register as a sex offender in his county. (He was given a suspended sentence for misdemeanor sexual contact in 1994, according to the lawsuit.)

Dalton, who is described as physically disabled and mentally impaired, was then held on a \$30,000 bond without seeing either a judge or his public defender, according to the lawsuit. He also did not have access to medication, nor did he meet his assigned public defender until he was brought into a courtroom for a bond hearing this month. He remains in jail while proceedings unfold as of the complaint's filing.

The plaintiffs' fleeting interactions with their own lawyers aren't isolated incidents, according to the ACLU. "Public defenders \[in Missouri\] average just 8.7 hours on the most serious non-homicide felonies, amounting to less than 20 percent of the minimum time recommended by the American Bar Association," the lawsuit said. "Overall, they are forced to devote fewer than the minimum hours recommended by the ABA in more than 97 percent of their cases."

Nor are Missouri's problems unparalleled across the country. When state legislators push for [[budget cuts]], funding for programs that help impoverished defendants can be a more politically palatable target than public schools or state health-care systems. A [similar class-action lawsuit](http://www.npr.org/2017/03/10/519211293/public-defenders-hard-to-come-by-in-louisiana) is also underway in Louisiana, where declining traffic-fine revenues and a billion-dollar budget shortfall at the state legislature have hamstrung indigent-defense funding. Public defenders throughout Kentucky [often take](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2016/09/07/when-the-money-runs-out-for-public-defense-what-happens-next#.QuNJOZ1id) more than twice the caseloads recommended by the ABA. The district attorney for New [[Mexico]]'s Lea County asked the state supreme court to intervene in December after the state's chief public defender [ordered his lawyers](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/29/us/new-[[mexico]]-lawyer-shortage.html) to stop taking new cases there.

But even amid a nationwide crisis, Missouri stands out: The state ranks 49th out of 50 states in indigent-defense funding, Barrett said. Only neighboring Mississippi ranks lower. "Mississippi\'s excuse is, 'we\'re the poorest state in the Union,'" he added. "I\'m not quite sure what Missouri\'s excuse is, beyond that we\'re just not interested in this particular constitutional right---although we\'re quite fond of some of the other constitutional amendments."

Even the U.S. Supreme Court has taken notice of the funding crisis for indigent defense, albeit only in passing. In *Luis v. United States* last year, the justices mulled whether federal agents could seize a defendant's untainted financial assets if that seizure would prevent the defendant from hiring a lawyer of their choice. The justices sided with Sila Luis, who had \$2 million in assets at issue, in a 5-3 decision.

Most of the decision focused on a legal balancing act between a defendant's right to counsel and the state's power to punish criminal acts---a battle ultimately won by the Sixth Amendment in this case. But Justice Stephen Breyer also raised a practical concern in his majority ruling. Seizing Luis's assets would "render her indigent" and force her to rely upon "underpaid and overworked public defenders," he noted. If the Court had accepted the federal [[government]]'s side in the case, Breyer surmised, it "would render less effective the basic right the Sixth Amendment seeks to protect."

Breyer's observation about the nation's public-defender systems unnerved some of Breyer's colleagues, especially when taken to its logical conclusion. "Given the large volume of defendants in the criminal justice system who rely on public representation," Justice Kennedy wrote in his dissent, "it would be troubling to suggest that a defendant who might be represented by a public defender will receive inadequate representation."

For Missouri, that suggestion appears to be a reality. The ACLU lawsuit describes a crisis for impoverished juvenile defendants, who are even less equipped to defend themselves in court. The lawsuit cites a 2015 Justice Department [report](https://sites.ed.gov/underservedyouth/files/2017/01/Report-Investigation-of-the-St-Louis-County-Family-Court.pdf) on the St. Louis County Family Courts in which federal officials found routine violations of children's rights in juvenile delinquency proceedings. Many of those violations sprung from the assignment of a single public defender to the county's juvenile-court system, who took 394 cases in 2014 alone. And Missouri's problems aren't limited to St. Louis County. A 2013 report by the National Juvenile Defenders Council cited by the lawsuit [found](http://njdc.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Missouri-Assessment.pdf)that 60 percent of state's young defendants come before its courts without legal counsel.

Barrett said he's tried reaching out to the governor and to state legislators to increase funding without success. Some of those attempts have been more dramatic than others. In one episode that received national attention, Barrett [used a provision](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/08/when-the-governor-is-your-lawyer/494453/) of the state's indigent-defense law in an attempt to compel former Missouri Governor Jay [[Nixon]], a [[Democrat]] and a trained lawyer, to represent a defendant last August. (A judge subsequently allowed [[Nixon]] to step aside.) His experience with Governor Eric Greitens, a [[Republican]] who replaced [[Nixon]] in November, hasn't been much better, Barrett said.

"I\'ve sent several letters to the new governor and multiple phone calls, none of which have been returned," Barrett said. "I\'m very interested in sitting down and trying to figure out a resolution to this, but I\'m not getting a lot of interest reciprocated." Greitens's office did not respond to a request for comment.
