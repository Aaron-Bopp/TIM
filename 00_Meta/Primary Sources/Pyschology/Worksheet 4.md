**2.** In this article, the authors argues that, having relevant expertise, police officers are better at differentiating between armed and unarmed targets in the first-person shooter task (FPST). However, the authors mention that police officers perform poorly on the FPST under certain conditions. Using information from the section titled "The Role of Cognitive Control in Expert Performance" (pp. 207-209), describe [two]{.ul} circumstances where a police officer is more likely to show racial bias in the FPST. In your response, be sure to explain the situation as well as why this may cause police officers to exhibit racial bias. **(5 pts)**
