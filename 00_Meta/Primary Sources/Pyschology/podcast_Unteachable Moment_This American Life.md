**<u>Companion Piece Write-Up (10 points)</u>**

**Instructions:** Access the assigned companion piece of the week (or find your own companion piece) and listen to, read, or watch the entire piece. Then, respond to all of the items. Your responses to each should be at least 0.5 double-spaced pages in size 12 font. To help, I grade 0.5 pages as 11 lines of content. If you have less than 11 lines, you will lose points for not writing enough.

**<u>Section 1 (Summary):</u>** Summarize the piece. Be sure to explain what the piece was about in enough detail that it is clear that you watched/read/listened to the entire piece. Also be sure to highlight aspects of the piece that show its relevance to race and/or gender.

Starbucks held national implicit bias training after an incident in one of their stores. This training consisted of a day long employee lead training seminar. Starbucks all accross the country were closed, and there would be more trainings in the coming months. The training did not focus on the specific incident (a black person not being a allowed to use the bathroom because they had not purchased a drink), but rather focused on bias and prejudice in general. While there were some specific references to Starbucks specific scenarios most of it was general. The conversations ranged from how white people react to natural hair, to incidents with black customers, to differences between people. National feeback to this move by Starbucks was mixed, but it was quickly overshadowed by the Roseanne incident. Starbucks CEO was interestingly hostile when the public relations nature of this move was addressed by reporters. 


**<u>Section 2 (Reading Connection):</u>** Discuss at least one **<u>reading from this week</u>** that relates to the piece. Be sure to explain which reading you are discussing, what the reading said about the topic, and how the reading is connected to the piece.

In the podcast they discussed a little bit of how implicit bias training has been seen as innefective by the public. I see 



**<u>Section 3 (Personal Reflection):</u>** Discuss how the piece relates to your own life experiences. Consider how the stories or information presented is similar to, or different from, what you've experienced. If the piece focuses on an identity very different from your own, you can think about how not having that identity has led to a different life. You can also discuss memories that the piece made you think of. You should <u>not</u> give your opinion or evaluation of the piece, and you should <u>not</u> just talk about how it made you feel (e.g. "this topic makes me sad").
