# Diagnosing Gender Dysphoria :: That's Gender Dysphoria, FYI

> ## Excerpt
> It's clinical.

**The [[Gender Dysphoria]] Bible is a Living Document**

The contents of this site will change over time as new additions and revisions are made to further expand upon the full breadth of [[Gender Dysphoria]]. In its current iteration it is severely lacking in AFAB narratives, [[non-binary]], agender & genderfluid specific dysphoria, and Third [[Gender]] narratives. The GDB is an open source and publicly funded project, [content](https://github.com/GenderDysphoria/GenderDysphoria.fyi) and [fiscal](https://patreon.com/curvyandtrans) contributions are extremely welcome.

This section is going to focus on the diagnostic criteria under the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of [[mental disorders]], version five (DSM-5). The reason I’m focusing on this standard is because, well, nobody else has one. The [[Britain|UK]]’s National Health Service basically mirrors the APA’s DSM. Other countries have their own local standards, but they’re all either very similar, or a lot more outdated.

The WPATH SoC describes ways that [[Gender Dysphoria]] manifests, but does not define clear diagnostic criteria, instead leaving it up to individual [[mental health]] professionals to make their own diagnoses. In general it advocates that if the [[patient]] is of sound mind and body and says that they have [[Gender Dysphoria]], then they should be believed. The key piece here is “sound mind and body”, it is left to the [[mental health]] professional to do the due diligence to ensure that there are no other conditions which may be causing the [[patient]] to believe this.

Or to put it bluntly, WPATH says that if you think you’re [[transgender|trans]], you’re [[transgender|trans]]. This has been the attitude that the majority of the community has adopted as well. As long as you believe your [[gender]] does not match what you were assigned at birth, you are [[transgender]]. However, insurance companies aren’t so happy with [[self]]-diagnoses, so here are the criteria which are defined in DSM-5 for diagnosing someone with [[Gender Dysphoria]].

#### For Your Information

Diagnosis of [[gender dysphoria]] in prepubescent children requires the child must have a documented six month history of meeting six of these criteria, as well as demonstrated distress or impairment in function.

1.  A strong [[desire]] to be of the other [[gender]] or an insistence that one is the other [[gender]]
2.  A strong preference for wearing clothes typical of the opposite [[gender]]
3.  A strong preference for cross-[[gender]] roles in make-believe play or fantasy play
4.  A strong preference for the toys, games or activities stereotypically used or engaged in by the other [[gender]]
5.  A strong preference for playmates of the other [[gender]]
6.  A strong rejection of toys, games and activities typical of one’s assigned [[gender]]
7.  A strong dislike of one’s sexual anatomy
8.  A strong [[desire]] for the physical sex characteristics that match one’s experienced [[gender]]

**Note** These are the criteria for adolescents and adults. Children have a different set of criteria, which [you can find here](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-[[gender]]-dysphoria). I have also changed the wording slightly, here, as the official criteria are binary-centric.

For an adult to be diagnosed with [[gender dysphoria]] by a licensed [[mental health]] professional they must meet two of these six criteria, and have experienced those criteria for longer than six months.

-   [[No]] ==**A marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed [[gender]] and primary and/or secondary sex characteristics**==

    The way the person sees the world and interacts with the world does not align with the way it is typically expected for someone of the [[gender]] they were assigned at birth. There are a very broad number of traits which fit into this description. It can be in the way they interact with others, how they talk, what hobbies they prefer, how they dress, their body language and mannerisms, what [[gender]](s) they relate to more.

-   [[Yes]] ==**A strong [[desire]] to be rid of one’s primary and/or secondary sex characteristics**==

-   [[Yes]] ==**A strong [[desire]] for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of another [[gender]]**==

    These two are pretty well paired. This is physical dysphoria as previously defined. The person finds discomfort with aspects of their body which are a result of their sex at birth.

-   [[Yes]] ==**A strong [[desire]] to be of another [[gender]]**==

-   [[Yes]] ==**A strong [[desire]] to be treated as another [[gender]]**==

    These are the social and societal dysphoria. They are how a person wants to interact with the world, and wants the world to interact with them.

-   [[Sometimes]] ==**A strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions of another [[gender]]**==

    This is pretty [[self]] explanatory.


As I said, only two of these conditions need be met for a formal diagnosis. You may notice that only two of these comprise the physical body. It is perfectly valid for a [[transgender|trans]] person to be experiencing [[Gender Dysphoria]] without actually hating any part of their body, or wanting to change any part of their body. Physical Dysphoria is only one fraction of the many ways that lead to being [[transgender|trans]].

Now, here is the kicker. If you identify as [[transgender]], meaning that your [[gender]] does not align with the binary sex you were assigned at birth, you already meet two of these criteria! You have a strong enough [[desire]] to be of another [[gender]] that you are identifying that you _are_ another [[gender]], and you have a strong conviction of what your [[gender]] feels like, and it isn’t what you were given at birth.

So, it is literally impossible for a person to identify as [[transgender|trans]] and not experience [[gender dysphoria]]. By the WPATH requirements anyone can identify as [[transgender|trans]]. Ergo, the statement “you do not have to have dysphoria to be [[transgender]]” is a logical paradox.

Then why do we still say it? Because most people don’t know what [[gender dysphoria]] actually is, and it is easier to repeat the mantra than to explain the nuances and subtleties of how [[Gender Dysphoria]] manifests. But hey, look, now you’ve got a nice article to link to that can help people understand that.
