- From [[13 Diagnosing Gender Dysphoria]]

    - **A strong [[desire]] for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of another [[gender]]**
    - **A strong [[desire]] to be of another [[gender]]**
    - **A strong [[desire]] to be treated as another [[gender]]**
- From [[2 A Brief History of Gender Dysphoria]]
    - This incongruence is so deep inside the brain�s subsystems that there is no obvious message of what the problem is.
- From [[4 Physical Dysphoria]]
    - Sometimes it may just simply be a feeling of being incorrect, which you may not even attribute to [[gender]] or sex.
    - It�s okay if you don�t hate anything about your body, and just wish you looked more feminine or masculine.
- From [[5 Biochemical Dysphoria]]
    - A sense of detachment or estrangement from your own thoughts, feelings, or body: �I know I have feelings but I don�t feel them�
    - Feeling as if you have an �unreal� or absent [[self]]: �I have no [[self]]�
    - Being absorbed in yourself and experiencing a compulsive [[self]]-scrutiny or extreme rumination
    - Having an ongoing and coherent dialog with yourself
    - You may put little care into your physical appearance, reaching for only the basic utilitarian needs in clothing and personal hygiene.
    - You may be unconcerned with the state of your body, perhaps not even fearing death, because you have so little attachment to your life.
    - You have an underlying sense that you are "not like" most people.
    - Your friends might get you, but you draw an instinctive and unconscious line between you and "normal" people. When you interact with a "normal" person, you're not sure what to say or how to act.
    - You find it hard to prioritize your own feelings. You're aware of emotions you \*should\* be feeling, but they're distant and fake-seeming
    - You struggle to imagine a future for yourself where you are happy or fulfilled.
    - You only take steps to better your life when external forces \*make\* you.
    - You'd rather withdraw and [[self]]-minimize and focus on escapist hobbies
    - Your surroundings seem alien or unfamiliar, even if you�ve always been there, like someone has swapped out your house for a stage replica.
    - Distortions in [[perception]] of time, such as recent events feeling like distant past.
    - DPDR sometimes comes with an emotional stunting. You are able to laugh and find humor, but rarely ever genuine joy. Moments of sadness or grief cause you to just go numb, dissociated by the event that caused it.
    - This can also go in the opposite direction, where the person is under so much [[anxiety]] that their emotional response is extremely disproportionate to the catalyst, resulting in severe crying or violent outbursts from seemingly small events.
- From [[6 Social Dysphoria]]
    - When you interact with very masculine men, you're nervous. You don't really know how to carry on a conversation with them, or want to.
    - You're awkward at social touch.
    - You struggle even to voice innocent physical compliments to others, like "Looking good!" You are hyper-aware that virtually anything could sound like unwanted sexual attention, coming from you. You feel like your attention is uniquely, universally unwelcome.
    - When an AFAB friend expresses disapproval, you're devastated. You scramble to get their approval back. You're worried you're coming across as a simpering "nice guy," all of whom you despise. You just value your AFAB friends' opinions more highly, for reasons you can't explain.
    - They may feel themselves drawn more to friendships with [[women]], but become frustrated at the social and heterosexual dynamics that come into play between men and [[women]], preventing them from forming platonic relationships.
    - They may find themselves deeply hurt when [[women]] shy away from them on principle.
- From [[7 Societal Dysphoria]]
    - For example, many [[transgender|trans]] [[women]] have stories about feeling the need to cover up their chest pre-transition out of an intrinsic sense of modesty.
    - AMABs may find themselves wishing _they_ were the one being pampered
- From [[9 Presentational Dysphoria]]
    - a wish to be able to present as people of that [[gender]] do.
    - When you get ready to go, you just roll out of bed and throw on whatever. You don't really do any [[self]]-grooming, or care about what's on your body. You're a little proud of your lack of vanity, your deeper, non-appearance-level existence.
    - Your clothes are chosen almost entirely for comfort.
    - Feeling envious of other girls for being pretty is a thing that many many [[women]] feel. Dysphoria is a real headfuck of a layer on top of that feeling, yet I just wanna say that if you�re a [[transgender|trans]] woman feeling envious of another [[transgender|trans]]

# [[No]]

- From [[0 That's Gender Dysphoria, FYI]]
    - Some children identify it at as soon as they are able to grasp the concept of the differences between the sexes, others don�t start to feel anything until the onset of puberty

    - When a video game gives you the option of choosing your [[gender]], you tend to choose differently than your assigned [[gender]].
    - A preference for literature and film with characters of your true [[gender]], or with characters who break [[gender]] norms (Mulan, Little [[Women]]).
    - Pornographic outlets which satisfy strong desires or feel more relatable, such as a draw towards gay/lesbian porn, bridal kink, or transformation sequences.
    - Crossdressing or performing drag.
    - Finding excuses to cut hair short, or to grow it out.
    - Wearing loose and baggy clothing that hides the shape of your body.

    - Growing and meticulously grooming facial hair (the so-called �denial beard�).

    - Aggressively passive engagement in anything connected to one�s true [[gender]].
    - Long hours spent at work.
    - Obsessively cleaning one�s living space.
    - Sleeping. Lots and lots of sleeping.
- From [[13 Diagnosing Gender Dysphoria]]
    - **A marked incongruence between one�s experienced/expressed [[gender]] and primary and/or secondary sex characteristics**
- From [[4 Physical Dysphoria]]
    - It can manifest as a compulsion to be rid of certain body traits, such as obsessively shaving body or facial hair. This can also manifest in the opposite compulsion, leading to meticulous grooming of those traits in order to try to control them, like maintaining a perfect beard, persistently keeping ones nails manicured and polished, or spending hours in the gym attempting to hone ones shape.
- From [[5 Biochemical Dysphoria]]
    - Feeling split into two parts, with one going through the motions of participating in the world and one observing quietly: �There is this body that walks around and somebody else just watches
    - Experiencing the world as distant, dreamlike, foggy, lifeless, colorless, artificial, like a picture with no depth, or less than real
    - Lacking a sense of agency � feeling flat, robotic, dead, or like a �zombie�
    - Inability to imagine things
    - you may hyperfocus on your appearance, attempting to try to spark some kind of joy, any kind of feeling of pride in your own body, only to be met with more hollowness.
    - You often feel directionless in life. When asked about career goals in High School, you didn't really care about your answer. Even careers centered in your interests seemed kind of intolerable.
    - Surroundings that appear distorted, blurry, colorless, two-dimensional or artificial, or a heightened awareness and clarity of your surroundings. Leaves on trees feel like they have extra sharp edges, for example.
    - Distortions of distance and the size and shape of objects
    - People with DPDR tend to have a mile long stare as they move about in the world; eyes so gloomy and dead that they look like a shell.
- From [[6 Social Dysphoria]]
    - Being vulnerable around strange men is terrifying. You're anxious when you use the public men's room.
    - Their behaviors and mannerisms feel strange and surprising, where interactions with individuals of your true [[gender]] feel easier.
- From [[7 Societal Dysphoria]]
    - Before I transitioned, just the thought of doing any sexual or romantic with a girl made me nauseous, because doing that would feel like I was adopting a masculine role - the role of the boyfriend, the male lover - and that kicked my latent dysphoria into overdrive
    - When I read cishet experiences of their sexuality, I feel nothing but alienation.
- From [[8 Sexual Dysphoria]]
    - Deviations from these roles often result in shame, both from partners and from peers.
    - [[transgender|Trans]] people who enter into perceptually heterosexual relationships pre-transition sometimes find themselves losing interest in sexual intercourse, as penetrative acts do not produce the fulfillment that they would expect.
    - [[transgender|Trans]] children often internalize their view of their peers based on their true [[gender]], and one does not objectify their equals
    - Even around the most beautiful [[women]], I would avoid even looking at them,

# [[Sometimes]]

- From [[11 Managed Dysphoria Gender in Disguise]]
    - Shaving of body hair, or a refusal to shave hair you�re expected to.
    - Avoiding social gatherings whenever possible, seeking isolation.
    - Many [[transgender|trans]] people speak about having a phase of life where they attempted to �buy-in� on their assigned [[gender]], performing masculinity or femininity to extremes in order to try to �fix� themselves
- From [[13 Diagnosing Gender Dysphoria]]
    - **A strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions of another [[gender]]**

    - Feeling like a veil or glass wall separates you from the world
    - Emotional or physical numbness, such as a feeling of having a head filled with cotton
    - Being able to think clearly, but feeling as if some essential quality is lacking from your thoughts or experience of the world
    - A sense of disconnectedness from life, impeding you from creative and open involvement with the world
    - When someone else is upset, it's much more real and urgent. You believe this is just your stoic, protective nature.
    - Moving through the world feels like you�re walking on a treadmill, with the buildings moving around you instead of you through them.
    - Feeling emotionally disconnected from people you care about, as if you were separated by a glass wall, or like they are just actors pretending to be the people they claim to be.
    - Feeling like a passive observer in the events of your life
- From [[6 Social Dysphoria]]
    - Changing in a gym locker room is unthinkable.
    - Even when your commentary is solicited, everything you could say feels unwanted and inappropriate
    - For example, an AMAB [[transgender|trans]] person may find themselves very uncomfortable in groups of men. They may feel out of place and struggle to fit in among their male peers. Masculine social interactions don�t come naturally to them, and trying to emulate their male friends feels awkward.
- From [[8 Sexual Dysphoria]]
    - as someone with a strong fascination with [[women]]�s apparel, particularly lingerie.
    - But on top of all of this, I was _terrified_ to be seen expressing legitimate sexual interest in other [[women]].

    - an interest in feminine presentation to be misinterpreted as sexual [[desire]].
