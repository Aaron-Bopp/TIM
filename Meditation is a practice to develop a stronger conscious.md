#TO/TEND/MULCH 
[[Zen]] helps you develop [[conscious|consciousness]] by making you aware of your [[Indriya]] but [[Trataka]] helps you strengthen your ability to to focus on one thing and allow your [[subconscious]] to be closer to the world:
[[Meditation is a practice and discipline of observation]]

^[[[Brahman]]]
[[Consciousness is the fundamental unit of existence]]
