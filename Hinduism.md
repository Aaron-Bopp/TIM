#### <s class="topic-title">[[Hinduism]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [Hinduism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism)
> 
> Hinduism is an Indian religion and [[dharma]], or way of life. It is the world's third-largest religion, with over 1.2 billion followers, or 15–16% of the global population, known as Hindus. 
> 
> 'Hinduism is a diverse system of thought marked by a range of philosophies and shared concepts, rituals, cosmological systems, pilgrimage sites, and shared textual sources that discuss [[theology]], [[metaphysics]], [[mythology]], Vedic [[yajna]], [[yoga]], agamic rituals, and temple building, among other topics. 
> 
> Prominent themes in Hindu beliefs include the four Puruṣārthas, the proper goals or aims of human life; namely, [[dharma]] (ethics/duties), artha (prosperity/work), kama (desires/passions) and [[moksha]] (liberation/freedom from the passions and the cycle of death and rebirth), as well as [[karma]] (action, intent and consequences) and saṃsāra (cycle of death and rebirth). 
> 
> Hinduism prescribes the eternal duties, such as honesty, refraining from injuring living beings (Ahiṃsā), patience, forbearance, self-restraint, virtue, and compassion, among others. 
> 
> Sources of authority and eternal truths in the Hindu texts play an important role, but there is also a strong Hindu tradition of questioning authority in order to deepen the [[understanding]] of these truths and to further develop the tradition.
