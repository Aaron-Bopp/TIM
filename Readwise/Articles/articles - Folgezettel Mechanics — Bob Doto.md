A mechanistic view is one that privileges the mechanics of a process over the experiential. It ignores the emotional. It tries to establish cohesion often through reductive arguments, determining value (more or less of it) by how parts function together as a system divorced from the subjective experience of the user.

At its best, the idea that folgezettel "doesn't establish meaningful connections," is an unfortunate misrepresentation of what takes place when a thoughtful user directly engages with the alphanumeric system of identification.

The numbers themselves may appear meaningless to the untrained eye, but over time they, and the note titles that follow, speak not only to their placement in a physical or digital enumerated list, but to their content, as well as the way that content relates to the content of other notes.

Folgezettel gives the note maker a bird's eye view of the initial connections that have been made between notes as they were imported into the zettelkasten. Whereas timestamps provide a record of when notes were created, folgezettel provides a window into how an idea was first contextualized at the time it was imported.

Eufriction is good friction. Just as weight training, writing a book, and giving birth can all be considered a form of eustress[6], so too is folgezettel a form of eufriction. It slows the note maker down just enough to force them to think about what they're doing. It builds good habits. It strengthens mental connections. It's the kind of friction needed to help note takers who tend to drown in capture bloat—always onboarding, never offloading.
