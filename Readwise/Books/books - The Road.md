The boy being God is a main theme of this book. The boy does not posses any godlike features except the most important one, the ability to fuel belief. Without the boy, the man would not be able to believe that there are people out there, that those people might be worth saving, and that there is a reason for their suffering.

He knew only that the child was his warrant. He said: If he is not the word of God God never spoke.

What would you do if I died? If you died I would want to die too. So you could be with me? Yes. So I could be with you. Okay.

Then he just knelt in the ashes. He raised his face to the paling day. Are you there? he whispered. Will I see you at the last? Have you a neck by which to throttle you? Have you a heart? Damn you eternally have you a soul? Oh God, he whispered. Oh God.

You promised not to do that, the boy said. What? You know what, Papa. He poured the hot water back into the pan and took the boy’s cup and poured some of the cocoa into his own and then handed it back. I have to watch you all the time, the boy said. I know. If you break little promises you’ll break big ones. That’s what you said. I know. But I wont.

Sooner or later they will catch us and they will kill us. They will rape me. They’ll rape him. They are going to rape us and kill us and eat us and you wont face it. You’d rather wait for it to happen. But I cant. I cant.

###### ^283957206q

The one thing I can tell you is that you wont survive for yourself. I know because I would never have come this far. A person who had no one would be well advised to cobble together some passable ghost. Breathe it into being and coax it along with words of love. Offer it each phantom crumb and shield it from harm with your body. As for me my only hope is for eternal nothingness and I hope it with all my heart.

The mother did not try to shield the boy from her madness  

###### ^283957207q

The hundred nights they’d sat up debating the pros and cons of self destruction with the earnestness of philosophers chained to a madhouse wall. In the morning the boy said nothing at all and when they were packed and ready to set out upon the road he turned and looked back at their campsite and he said: She’s gone isn’t she? And he said: Yes, she is.

The man observing the nature of the boy after his mother killed herself.  

###### ^283957208q

Always so deliberate, hardly surprised by the most outlandish advents. A creation perfectly evolved to meet its own end.

The man isn't refering to the boy as god, but the author does write it in such a way that it almost sees that way  

###### ^283957209q

God, he whispered. He reached and shook the boy, keeping his eyes on the road.

This is my child, he said. I wash a dead man’s brains out of his hair. That is my job.

The boy sat tottering. The man watched him that he not topple into the flames. He kicked holes in the sand for the boy’s hips and shoulders where he would sleep and he sat holding him while he tousled his hair before the fire to dry it. All of this like some ancient anointing. So be it. Evoke the forms. Where you’ve nothing else construct ceremonies out of the air and breathe upon them.

He’d seen it all before. Shapes of dried blood in the stubble grass and gray coils of viscera where the slain had been field-dressed and hauled away. The wall beyond held a frieze of human heads, all faced alike, dried and caved with their taut grins and shrunken eyes. They wore gold rings in their leather ears and in the wind their sparse and ratty hair twisted about on their skulls. The teeth in their sockets like dental molds, the crude tattoos etched in some homebrewed woad faded in the beggared sunlight. Spiders, swords, targets. A dragon. Runic slogans, creeds misspelled. Old scars with old motifs stitched along their borders. The heads not truncheoned shapeless had been flayed of their skins and the raw skulls painted and signed across the forehead in a scrawl and one white bone skull had the plate sutures etched carefully in ink like a blueprint for assembly. He looked back at the boy.
