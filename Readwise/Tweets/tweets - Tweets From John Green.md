@Aranmanmy I side with Rabi'a al-Adawiyya, who was once asked why she was carrying a bucket of water and a torch. "I am going to burn down the gates of heaven and pour water on the fires of hell, so that people will not love God for want of heaven or fear of hell, but because He is God."

If a religion achieves its power even partly through telling children they will spend eternity in torment if they don't adhere to a particular religious worldview, then I think there is a huge theological and moral failure at the beating heart of the religion.
