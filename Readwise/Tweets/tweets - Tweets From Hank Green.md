McKinsey (and various other institutions) have become ways to outsource your conscience. Many people at these companies know how to put profit above their communities, but they can’t bring themselves to do it until they pay a fancy consultant to tell them to. https://t.co/fKrHhtCivh

I still want to deserve what I have, but I've realized that I can't. There's no there there. Nothing could ever mean I deserve clean water because that would mean someone else /doesn't./
John helped me get to "there is no deserving, only doing what you can with what you have."

I once confided in a therapist that I was worried that having better systems for dealing with my insecurities would make me a less effective person and she said something I really really really didn’t expect: “That is very common.”

I wanted to cultivate my insecurity to remain "effective," but why not just take out some of the insecurity and focus on what I actually want...to do work I'm good that solves problems.
Not "I want to deserve what I have so I'll solve problems" but "I want to solve problems."
