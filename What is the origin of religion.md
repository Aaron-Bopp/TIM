#### [[What is the origin of religion]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Prior to [[Emile Durkheim]] [[Animism]] and [[Naturism]] where the foremost theories of the origin of religion.
Durkheim's main argument was that these theories were not adaptive enough to be a 
result of:: [[Humans are a product of evolution]]

Durkheim states that 
broadly [[religious belief]] itself is not adaptive due to the way it misrepresents the world but that [[Religion creates social order through group membership and prescribed behavior]].
