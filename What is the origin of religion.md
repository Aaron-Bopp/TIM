#### [[What is the origin of religion]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Prior to [[Emile Durkheim]] [[Animism]] and [[Naturism]] where the foremost theories of the origin of religion.
Durkheim's main argument was that these theories were not adaptive enough to be a 
result of:: [[Humans are a product of evolution]]

Durkheim states that 
broadly [[religious belief]] itself is not adaptive due to the way it misrepresents the world but that [[Religion creates social order through group membership and ritual]].

This separates the origin of religion from the origin of [[belief]]. This distinction is important in modern times as religious people often associate lack of [[religious belief]] as [[nihilism]], but [[belief]] in atheists can be just as strong

answers:
- as a [[spandrel]] of [[Belief can motivate adaptation]]
	- Religious belief based of observation such as [[Animism]] and [[Naturism]] would be in this bucket. They viewed the complexity of the world and assumed their must be a designing agent. They weren't wrong: [[Natural selection is a designing agent]]
- [[Religion creates social order through group membership and ritual]]
- [[Religion is a rational bid for supernatural reward]]
- 
%% [[Atheists don't believe that god doesn't exist they believe in a different source of truth]] %%

- [[Moral social control promotes pro-social behavior in groups]]
- [[Religion promotes high social control]]
