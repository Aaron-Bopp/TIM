#### [[Farming capitalized on group selection]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

As early humans transitioned from [[human foraging]] to [[human farming]], their overall quality of life went down not up. Plague's of infectious [[disease]] and starvation were unheard of in foraging times, partially because [[Foraging kept populations down]] and because [[Foraging allowed for a diverse diet]], but mainly because their were never enough people around to die.

However, farming was able to overtake foraging as the main method of survival in just few millennia by capitalizing on [[Evolution]]. Simply by influencing humans to have more children, evolution was able to overcome the disadvantages of farming life.

This was not the only evolutionary force acting on humans, as [[Wheat domesticated humans]]

This is part of [[Greater cooperation and communication has lead to the success of humans as a species]]
