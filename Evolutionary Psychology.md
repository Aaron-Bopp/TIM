#### <s class="topic-title">[[Evolutionary Psychology]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [Evolutionary Psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary%20psychology)
> 
> Evolutionary psychology is a theoretical approach in the social and natural sciences that examines psychological structure from a modern evolutionary perspective. It seeks to identify which human psychological traits are evolved adaptations â€“ that is, the functional products of [[natural selection]] in [[human evolution]]. 
> 
> For physiological mechanisms, such as the heart, lungs, and immune system, thinking about adaptation is common. 
> Evolutionary psychology is applying the same thinking to [[psychology]], arguing that the modularity of [[mind]] is similar to that of the [[body]] and with different modular adaptations serving different functions. 
> The argument is that much of [[human behavior]] is the output of psychological adaptations that evolved to solve recurrent problems in human ancestral environments.
> This means that behaviors or traits that occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary psychology,
> including the abilities to infer others' [[emotions]], discern kin from non-kin, identify and prefer healthier mates, and cooperate with others.
> 
> Criticism of evolutionary psychology involves questions of testability, cognitive and evolutionary assumptions (such as modular functioning of the brain, and large uncertainty about the ancestral environment), importance of non-genetic and non-adaptive explanations, as well as political and ethical issues due to interpretations of research results.

Like any other theory, Evolutionary Psychology needs to be used reasonably, 
as [[Experts are often far too confident in the effectiveness of their theories]].
This is reflected 
in [[Evolutionary Psychology is just a framework not a prescription of behavior]].
