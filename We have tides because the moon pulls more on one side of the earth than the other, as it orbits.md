#### [[We have tides because the moon pulls more on one side of the earth than the other, as it orbits]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

My understanding: 
Moon is always orbitting the earth
Water on the moon side is getting pulled more toward to moon, water on the no moon side is getting less pulled toward moon. Earthy gravity is static, so both sides have high tide while the middle sides are low tide, so "normal" level is actually in between high tide and low tide.

It feels like the moon would always be putting the no moon at low tide, but it is high tide because their is less gravity pulling that water in the direction of the moon, letting it pull a little bit a way from the earth, compared to the rest of the water.
