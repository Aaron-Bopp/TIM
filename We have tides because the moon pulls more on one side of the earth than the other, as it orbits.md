#### [[We have tides because the moon pulls more on one side of the earth than the other, as it orbits]] 

My understanding: 
The [[Earth]] is always rotating so at any given point there is a side of the [[Earth]] that is closer to the moon than the other.

Due to [[gravity]],
Water on [[the moon]] side is getting pulled more toward to moon, water on the no moon side is getting less pulled toward moon. 
If feels like
the side closer to the moon would be at high tide because it is getting pulled more by the moon's gravity,
but actually
both the side closer and the side farther from the moon are at high tide and the sides perpendicular to the moon are at low tide.
The reason the no moon side is at high tide is because there is less gravity pulling that water in the direction of the moon, letting it pull a little bit a way from the earth, compared to the rest of the water.
The reason the moon side is at high tide is because it is getting pulled a little more by the moon's gravity.
