Wheat did not offer us a better life, but [[Farming outcompeted foraging by shear force]]. Cultivating wheat allowed for the population to grow exponentially.

This domestication lead to the development of [[society]] and [[culture]] as human's being closer together for long periods of time allowed them to develop an [[Imagined reality]], which lead to [[Social order is built off of a shared belief in an imagined reality]]
