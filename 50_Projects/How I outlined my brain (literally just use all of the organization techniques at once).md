# [[How I outlined my brain (literally just use all of the organization techniques at once)]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Since I started my [[second brain]], 
^[[[Communities are knowledge graphs]]]
I have been fixated on the idea of *outlining everything I know.*

I have tried many different ways of doing this. At first I tried creating outlines inside of my [[topic note|topic notes]], and then embedded them into each other to creat one massive index. However this eventually grew constricting as I spent more and more time deciding what topic note each [[evergreen notes|evergreen note]] should go into, and then where that topic note should go--it was everything that I didn't want it to be. So I decided to stop focusing on topic notes and to instead focus [[Using spaced repetition for your conceptual notes|on interlinking my evergreen notes]]. While this process was fruitful, it did not fulfill my need to *organize.* I wanted to know where things went, I wanted to know how things fit together, and not just as singular concepts in space, but as a **building blocks** of the ***puzzle of reality***... Anyways, slightly villanous aspirations aside, I wanted to be able to organize my notes without constricting myself, so I continued to explore.

## The search
Somewhere along my [[knowledge management|PKM]] journey,
I discovered the [[Johnny Decimal System]].
Not only was this a way to number and organize folders so that they made sense,
it was a [[philosophy]] of organization that my brain stuck on to.
"Divide everything in to ten things, then in each area, divide in ten again."
I felt that if I could divide my [[evergreen notes]] into systems of ten
it would mean that I understood how they fit together in the real world. The problem was [[Johnny Decimal System]] was a system for organizing folders, and I had all of my [[evergreen notes]] in one flat folder.
### Why I was so committed to a flat file structure
### What makes organizing worth it
## The solution

I am eventually going to fall short, and then what, I will have to move my files.
causing tons of [[friction]].
until I realized, why not keep a flat folder structure, and just use [[Breadcrumbs]] to create a hierarchy on top. 
This is almost as good folders, except it does not port as well, but it allows me to create hierarchy without putting things into folders.

The beautiful thing about a [[web of thought]] is, you aren't constricted to just one organization structure. You can mix and match all you want, because at the end of the day, you will always have the all-powerfu [[bi-directional links]].
