#### [[Using Obsidian's graph as a class companion]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Early this year I started do a self-paced online course created by [[Dr. K]] about [[meditation]], [[depression]], and [[anxiety]]. I have been watching [[Dr. K]] for a little over a year and I already had plenty of [[evergreen notes]] relating to these subjects, so this course offered an opportunity to expand my knowledge in those areas.

I downloaded the glossary as markdown and used a little bit of [[Regex]] and [[Note Refactor (plugin, obsidian)|Note Refactor]] magic to turn all of the terms into their own [[topic notes]]. This enabled two things. One, I know had editable definitions that I could use as jumping of points for writing and could connect together to start to form a little [[web of thought]]. Second, as I started to take notes on all the videos, [[Various Complements (plugin, obsidian)|Various Complements]] was able to autocomplete all of those terms and link those notes at the same time. This made the actual note-taking process more streamlined and contributed to the [[web of thought]].
