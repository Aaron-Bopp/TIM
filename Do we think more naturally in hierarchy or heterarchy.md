#### [[Do we think more naturally in hierarchy or heterarchy]]

At first thought I think we think no because neurons don't have an up connection and down connection
but in society we definitely gravitate towards some kind of [[hierarchy]].
[[We naturally define relationships between ideas]] but relationships don't have to be hierarchical.
Even if we do think in [[hierarchy]] it definitely isn't static.
Can we hold multiple different items as children of the same item?
