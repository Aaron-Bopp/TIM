#### [[There shouldn't be more than a minute between lightning and thunder]]

Thunder can only be heard for a distance of 10 miles, this means the longest time between seeing lightning and hearing thunder should be 50 seconds.

This is because the speed of sound is roughly .2 miles per second so each mile should account for 5 seconds.
