#### [[You need to teach yourself what you read]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This
answers:: [[How to read to understand]],
in addition to:: [[You need to remember what you read]]

To understand and to remember is to learn, but the book is not teaching you, the author is not teaching you, [[spaced repetition]] is not teaching, you are teaching yourself. You need to be working with the content in order to understand.
^[Thankfully, unlike school, you want to be there, otherwise you wouldn't be reading the book]
%%
You need to giving yourself homework. Write prompts and research questions for yourself. 
You don't necessarily need to be creating new thought, 
but 
You even need to be creating new thought about what you read.
%%
Any insight that you can find original or not is vital to your understanding.
The main point is not just to rephrase the author,
although that is helpful,
the point also not to quiz yourself on what the author is telling you,
although that also can be helpful,
the point is to work with the material enough that you could teach it to someone else,
so first you need to teach it to yourself.
