#### [[You need to teach yourself what you read]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This
answers:: [[How to read to understand]],
because:: [[You need to remember what you read]]

To understand and to remember is to learn, but the book is not teaching you, the author is not teaching you, [[spaced repetition]] is not teaching, you are teaching yourself. You need to be working with the content and giving yourself homework. Write prompts and research questions for yourself. You even need to be creating new thought about what you read. Any insight that you can find original or not is vital to your understanding
