#### [[Note titles should be abstractions of the note content]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

The note title is the most important part of any note, because it is the symbol of that concept in your [[second brain]]. 
Notes in your [[second brain]] will have varying levels of detail in line with
[[Conceptual notes vary in size and scope]], 
but whatever level detail it is at,
the note title should capture the concept that note is about.
The only way to do this is through [[abstraction]]. 
Your not title needs to be the most concise way of conveying what the note is about and means.
