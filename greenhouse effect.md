#### <s class="topic-title">[[greenhouse effect]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [greenhouse effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse%20effect)
> 
> The greenhouse effect is a process that occurs when energy from a planet's sun goes through its atmosphere and warms the planet's surface, but the atmosphere prevents the heat from returning directly to space, resulting in a warmer planet. Light arriving from our Sun passes through Earth's atmosphere and warms its surface. The warmed surface then radiates heat, which is absorbed by [[greenhouse gases]]. 
> 
> Most of the atmosphere is transparent to infrared, but a tiny proportion of greenhouse gases makes it almost completely opaque to wavelengths emitted by the surface. Greenhouse gas molecules absorb and emit this infrared, so heat up and emit radiant heat in all directions, warming other greenhouse gas molecules, and pass heat on to the surrounding air. Radiant heat going downwards further increases the surface temperature, adding to energy going up into the atmosphere.
