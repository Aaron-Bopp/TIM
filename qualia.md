> [!wikipedia] [qualia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia)
> 
> In:: [[philosophy]] of [[mind]],
> qualia are defined as individual instances of [[subjective]], [[conscious]] experience. The term qualia derives from the Latin meaning "of what sort" or "of what kind" in a specific instance, such as "what it is like to taste a specific apple — this particular apple now".
> Examples of qualia include the perceived sensation of pain of a headache, the taste of wine, as well as the redness of an evening sky.
> 
> As qualitative characters of sensation, qualia stand in contrast to propositional attitudes, where the focus is on beliefs about experience rather than what it is directly like to be experiencing.

> [!wikipedia] Is qualia a useful term?
> 
> The nature and existence of various definitions of qualia remain controversial. While some philosophers of mind like Daniel Dennett argue that qualia do not exist and are incompatible with [[neuroscience]] and [[naturalism]], some neuroscientists and neurologists state that qualia exist and that the desire to eliminate them is based on an erroneous interpretation on the part of some philosophers regarding what constitutes science.
