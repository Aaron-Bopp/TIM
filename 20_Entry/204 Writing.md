Here are some [[evergreen notes]] that I am proud of:
- [[Use Obsidian tags as temporal classifiers]]
- [[Communities are knowledge graphs]]
- [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]]
- [[Searching for THE answer is dangerous]]
- [[Gender is a social construct]]

Here are the topics overviews that are the most extensive:
- [[My TIM]]
- [[gender]]
- [[Christianity]]

While [[evergreen notes]] are often the best way to share [[knowledge]],

sometimes a more general and complete work is valuable. Additionally, because evergreen notes change over time, you may want to get a snapshot of an [[experience]] that can be shared. I haven't done much of this writing, but as I continue to share my notes more, I think I will write more of these more traditional pieces. 

Here are some such notes:
