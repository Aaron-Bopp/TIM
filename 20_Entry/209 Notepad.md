> On a related note, I think the process of realizing what’s relevant for a particular difficult problem is also another way to say “that’s an insight”. I’ve read a bit into the Insight Problem Solving literature, and insight can be thought of as a representational change that leads to solutions, which is maybe a more rigorous way to say that “you suddenly notice what’s relevant to the problem at hand”.
> 
> There are two (among several) widely known mechanisms that lead to insights - the kind of insights you can study in labs through nine-dots problems and the like, they are: constraint relaxation and chunk decomposition.
> 
> Making notes is, in a sense, externalizing representations, which means you can better detect constraints that are being imposed unnecessarily. Interconnected notes is a way to facilitate chunk decomposition, because an Evergreen note is similar to a chunk in that you can decompose it into other chunks which can help reconfigure your representation - or how you look at a problem. I think that’s how practicing PKM can facilitate the processes that yield insights.

[[Term notes]] can be narrowed down to a short definition, but topic notes cannot. You can go back to a source of truth for a theory or word, but not a topic. That isn't to say that the definitions or terms will never change, but that we are searching to define them. Topics cannot be defined because they hold so many definitions and are capturing a breadth of content. [[topic notes]] are useful in their lack of edges, while [[Term notes]] are useful only inside thier edges.
