> Whether you are a friend, foe, or simple traveler, welcome to a look into my [[second brain]]. I hope that the [[knowledge]] enshrined here will be helpful to you, and that you may leave more enriched than you arrive. Below I have outlined the more useful things on this site based on what you might be saying right now

# Wtf is going on, who are you, and how did I get here?

It's okay, I sometimes click on links and forget about it by the time I open them too. This is [[My TIM| my Totally Integrated Machine]] or at least the window into it's inner workings. This is an accumulation of years of thinking and months of writing in an app called [[Obsidian (software)|Obsidian]], you will find notes covering all the topics that I am interested in.  

This vault is an example of [Work with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu). These notes contain new ideas, old ideas, half baked projects, and hopefully something valuable. I use these notes everyday to learn and process information, and they have been massively valuable to me, but I share them so I can easily communicate that [[information]] with others. This is important for a multitude of reason, one of them being [[I don't write my notes for myself]].

The core features of this site are the [[bi-directional links]] and the graph view in the top right. Use them to navigate, you can also search or scroll through all of my notes on the left. On the bottom of each page you will see a list of backlinks, or notes that link to that note. Use any of these methods to navigate, or start from here:

- If you want to know what I am up to: [[202 Now]]
- If you want to know more about me: [[203 Me]]
- If you want to see some of my more polished writing: [[204 Writing]]
- If you want to see an overview of all my notes: [[205 Index]]
- If you are still confused maybe just keep reading this page

# Stop blabbering, I just want to know how to do the cool thing in the notes app

If you are already familiar with [[Obsidian (software)|Obsidian]] and want to see [[Templater|templates]] and [[Dataview]] scripts look in 20_Entry or 00_Meta. I've surrounded them all in code fences, so you can see my exact syntax. Beware, certain things may not be up to date or work without a little fiddling, but feel free to message me on Discord if you want advice: [[203 Me#Contact Me]]

Oh you just want pretty dot pictures? [[Graph Timeline|say no more!]]

# Obsidian? Note-taking? What are you talking about?

Welcome to the world of [[knowledge management|personal knowledge management]] or PKM. This is a thriving community around curating and creating [[knowledge]], I hope you jump in. 
If you have twenty minutes, this video is a great introduction to [[conceptual notes]]: [How to achieve more while studying less - Obsidian & Conceptual Notes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYJsGksojms) Once you are hooked, go to [[Obsidian (software)#Getting Started]]

If you're scared don't worry, you will be learning faster than you thought you could, because [[Communities are knowledge graphs]]. 

## What is this vault?
This is my personal attempt at creating a [[second brain]], [[digital garden]], [[Zettelkasten|virtual slip box]], or whatever new analogies come along. This started as a quest to map my brain and discover myself, and has transformed into me becoming nerdier than I ever thought I could be. Seriously, this stuff is so addicting you stop playing video games.

While this vault is an amalgamation of so many other's, it is also unique to me. I hope that you find something of value and steal from it for your own vault.

The three cores [[philosophy|philosophies]] of [[My TIM]] are:

- [[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge]]
- [[Your second brain should be an inspirational hub of creativity]]
- [[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]]

[^1]: [[Nodes in the second brain are an abstraction of our first brain]] 

If you'd like to hear more about [[evergreen notes]], which are core to this system, [^2] it might just be better to get it from the source: [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes)

# I am not looking through all this crap, tell me what you're all about!

I get it, we aren't all [[Autism|autistic]] pastor's kids with [[savior complex]]'s set out to save everything and everyone in the ultimate search for a system of thought that will lead us to [[enlightenment]]. *That's fine.* **I am in therapy.** It's all good. However, if you've made it this far and want to hear my thoughts on anything besides [[note writing]] click here: [[203 Me]] or if you want to see my most polished writing click here: [[204 Writing]]
