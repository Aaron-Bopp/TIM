# Welcome to [[my TIM]]ðŸ˜Š

Whether you are a freind, foe, or simple traveler, welcome to a look into my [[second brain]]. I hope that the knowledge enshrined here will be helpful to you, and that you may leave more enriched than you arrive. Below I have outlined the more useful things on this site based on what you might be saying right now

## Wtf is going on, who are you, and how did I get here?

It's okay, I sometimes click on links and forget about it by the time I open them too. This is [[My TIM| my Totally Integrated Machine]] or at least the window into it's inner workings. This is an accumulation of years of thinking and months of writing in an app called [[Obsidian (software)|]], you will find notes covering all the topics that I am interested in.  

The core features of this site are the [[bi-directional links]] and the graph view in the top right. Use them to navigate, you can also search or scroll through all of my notes on the left, or start from here:

- If you want to know more about me: [[_Me]]
- If you want to know what I am up to: [[_NOW]]
- If you want to see everything that I've written on: [[_INDEX]]
- If you are still confused maybe just keep reading this page

## Stop blabbering I just want to know how to do the cool thing in the notes app

If you are already familiar with Obsidian and want to see [[Templater|templates]] and [[Dataview]] scripts look in 20_Entry or 00_Meta\\Templates. 

Thought's directly helpful to obsidian users:

- [[Obsidian's graph is useful in the implicit and dynamic relations it can reveal]]

## Wow you don't have a high view of yourself, I actually just want to learn more about your note taking philosophy

I appreciate you! It's just a [[defense-mechanisms|defense-mechanism]] I swear. Here are some starting points for you:

If you have twenty minutes, this video is a great introduction to [[conceptual notes]]: [How to achieve more while studying less - Obsidian & Conceptual Notes - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYJsGksojms)

Taking conceptual notes are core to creating a [[second brain]]. [^1] The three cores [[philosophy|philosophies]] of [[My TIM]] are:

- [[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge]]
- [[Your second brain should be an inspirational hub of creativity]]
- [[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]]

[^1]: [[Nodes in the second brain are an abstraction of our first brain]]

## I am not looking through all this crap, tell me what you're all about

I get it, we aren't all [[Autism|autistic]] pastor's kids with savior complex's set out to save everything and everyone in the ultimate search for a system of thought that will lead us to [[enlightenment]]. That's fine. I am in [[therapy]]. It's all good. However, if you've made it this far and want to hear my thoughts on anything besides [[note writing]] here are the notes I am most proud of, and hopefully by the end you will see why I take them this way.

### No, like I can't stop thinking about the [[human experience]]... ever

- [[What is the cognitive effect of living in an unjust world|What is the cognitive effect of living in a unjust world?]]
- [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]]
- [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]]

### Screw it, it's [[religious trauma]] time

- [[My Deconstruction journey]]
- [[There aren't any downsides to working through trauma]]
- [[The brain is powerful enough to create supernatural experiences]]

### I'm not just an angry kid! I'm an angry [[transgender|trans]] kid!

- [[Gender is a social construct]]
- [[Biology supports the validity of trans people]]
- [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]]
- [[Self-hatred is born out of dissonance between self-image and self-perception]]

### Sometimes I'm happy though

- [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]]
- [[True optimism is acknowledging the suffering of the world and defying it anyway]]

### Yes, I have opinions on politics

- [[Ronald Reagan invented modern conservatism]]
- [[Republican voters do not hold their leaders accountable]]
