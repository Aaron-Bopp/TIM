#### [[Slavery became much cheaper after the Civil War]]

Between [[black codes]] and [[convict leasing]], 
any petty crime could land a black person in the antebellum south in practical slavery.

After convicting based off of [[black codes]], 
sentencing would involve labor to "cover" arbitrary fines, court fees, and housing costs.
The main purpose was to keep the southern economy moving with a nearly free labor source.
There was already a structure in place pre-civil war that would lease slaves from nearby farms.

> It could be lucrative for the states:  in 1898, some 73% of Alabama's entire annual state revenue came from convict leasing.
> African Americans, mostly adult males, due to "vigorous and selective enforcement of laws and discriminatory sentencing", made up the vast majority—though not all—of the convicts leased.
