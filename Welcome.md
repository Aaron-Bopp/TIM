# Welcome to [[my TIM]]ðŸ˜Š

Whether you are a freind, foe, or simple traveler, welcome to a look into my [[second brain]]. I hope that the knowledge enshrined here will be helpful to you, and that you may leave more enriched than you arrive. Below I have outlined the more useful things on this site based on what you might be saying right now

## Wtf is going on, who are you, and how did I get here?

It's okay, I sometimes click on links and forget about it by the time I open them too. This is [[My TIM| my Totally Integrated Machine]] or at least the window into it's inner workings. This is an accumulation of years of thinking and months of writing in an app called [[Obsidian (software)|]], you will find notes covering all the topics that I am interested in.  

The core features of this site are the [[bi-directional links]] and the graph view in the top right. Use them to navigate, you can also search or scroll through all of my notes on the left, or start from here:

- If you want to know more about me: [[Me]]
- If you want to know what I am up to: [[NOW]]
- If you want to see everything that I've written on: [[INDEX]]
- If you are still confused maybe just keep reading this page

## Stop blabbering I just want to know how to do the cool thing in the notes app

If you are already familiar with Obsidian and want to see [[Templater|templates]] and [[Dataview]] scripts look in 20_Entry or 00_Meta\\Templates. 

Thought's directly helpful to obsidian users:

- [[Obsidian's graph is useful in the implicit and dynamic relations it can reveal]]
- [[my TO(DO) and EVER(GREEN) structure]]
- [[The fragility of nodes in a second brain]]

## Wow, you don't have a high view of yourself, I actually just wanted to learn more about how to do all this note-taking stuff

I appreciate you! It's just a [[defense-mechanisms|defense-mechanism]] I swear. Here are some starting points for you:

If you have twenty minutes, this video is a great introduction to [[conceptual notes]]: [How to achieve more while studying less - Obsidian & Conceptual Notes - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYJsGksojms)

The three cores [[philosophy|philosophies]] of [[My TIM]] are:

- [[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge]]
- [[Your second brain should be an inspirational hub of creativity]]
- [[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]]

[^1]: [[Nodes in the second brain are an abstraction of our first brain]] 

If you'd like to hear more about [[evergreen notes]], which are core to this system, [^2] it might just be better to get it from the source: [[Andy Matuschak's Evergreen Notes]]

[^2]: [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]]

## I am not looking through all this crap, tell me what you're all about

I get it, we aren't all [[Autism|autistic]] pastor's kids with savior complex's set out to save everything and everyone in the ultimate search for a system of thought that will lead us to [[enlightenment]]. *That's fine.* **I am in therapy.** It's all good. However, if you've made it this far and want to hear my thoughts on anything besides [[note writing]] click here: [[Me]]
