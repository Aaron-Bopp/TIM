#### [[Altruism mainly evolves by inter-group selection]]

Looking at the evolution of [[reciprocal altruism]] through the lense of [[game theory]],
we can see that it only evolves over selfishness when there are inter-group forces.
One on one a more selfish individual will win via [[individual selection]], but when we look at [[group selection]] we can see why altruism evolves.
