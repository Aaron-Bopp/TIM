There are a couple of small things that still need to happen behind the scenes, but hopefully all the major changes are done.</p><h2 id=\"new-sample-stories\">New Sample Stories </h2><p>Including one I&apos;m really excited about! As of this week, I&apos;ve swapped out the exemplars&apos; section of the web version of this newsletter, which means that there are 2 new free stories available for readers to access. For those not aware, <strong>I publish new fiction every Wednesday </strong>to this very mailing list. If you&apos;re already subscribed, please consider sharing with friends who might be interested &#x2014; this newsletter really does depend on word-of-mouth recommendations, I definitely do not have a marketing budget, currently everything I earn from doing this goes to hosting fees. </p><p>Each story I write comes with an analysis summarizing a piece of research that went into writing the story. Interested folks can <a href=\"https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/membership/\">sign up for a membership to get access to the complete archive</a>, or check out the examples first. Flash fiction like <a href=\"https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/the-laundress/\">The Laundress &amp; the Beanstalk</a> goes out on the first Wednesday of the month, and you can get microfiction like <a href=\"https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/poison/\">Poison</a> (Laxatives, confections, &amp; stimulating pies) the other weeks. </p><h2 id=\"my-publications\">My Publications</h2><p>I&apos;ve also updated the public repository of my notes, which are <a href=\"https://publish.obsidian.md/eleanorkonik/\">here</a>.</p><p>In other news, I wrote <a href=\"https://eleanorkonik.com/considerations-for-fostering-a-healthy-active-online-community/\">Considerations for Fostering a Healthy &amp; Active Online Community</a> after several people asked for my opinion about how they could create healthy online communities for their software applications.</p><p>One thing I did not touch on was <em>fan communities.</em> I think it&apos;s always a creator&apos;s hope that we can create a community of fans around our work &#x2014; hopefully one that tempers honesty with kindness, enthusiasm with a recognition that creators do sometimes need to hunker down and &quot;just write.&quot;</p><p>To be clear, I&apos;ve never had any of these issues &#x2014; I&apos;ve only been sharing my stories for a couple of months, at this point &#x2014; but I&apos;m a fan of a lot of great creators with strong online presences, like Ursula Vernon, Seanan McGuire, and Ilona Andrews. I admire them, and hope to emulate what they&apos;ve accomplished in some small way. </p><h2 id=\"commenting-features\">Commenting Features</h2><p>To that end, now that over 500 of you (!) are signed up to read this newsletter, I want to make sure that there was an easy way for folks to react to and comment on the research overviews, stories, analyses and updates I post. As part of the migration to managed hosting, I opened up commenting to all subscribers. You should be able to log in using the email address you&apos;re subscribed to the newsletter with, and comment on posts.</p><p>Many of you have reached out with neat anecdotes, additional resources, and fun references on the topics I write about, and I&apos;m hoping that adding commenting software to the website will help us centralize that and share relevant, interesting information with other interested folks subscribed to this newsletter.</p><h2 id=\"nanowrimo\">NaNoWriMo</h2><p>Ona more personal note, I&apos;m doing National Novel Writing Month this year. It&apos;s an annual, international creative writing event where participants attempt to write a 50,000-word manuscript during the month of November. The manuscript I&apos;m working on is not a novel per se &#x2014; it&apos;s a series of interconnected short stories set in the same world as the stories I&apos;ve been sharing here &#x2014; but I&apos;d deeply appreciate if you left a word of encouragement in the comments section of this post by <a href=\"newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/november-updates/\">viewing it online</a>. I&apos;m interested to hear which facts, characters or plots you&apos;d like me to expand on. I&apos;d also love to know if you&apos;re doing anything exciting for November. </p><p>The story I&apos;m working on right now, by the way, is about the daughter of the conqueror from <a href=\"https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/eavesdrop/\">Eavesdrop</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/succulent/\">Succulent</a>. A couple of people reached out to let me know they were enjoying that storyline :) </p><p>Thank you for your support,</p><p>` Eleanor Konik </p>",

Ironworkers took this specialization to an extreme, creating so many taboos and rituals that they monopolized the skill, creating guilds. Leather workers, potters and other tradesmen started doing the same thing. They wanted to make sure their grandkids continued in the tradition and started marrying their kids to each other. So basically, one way castes can develop is basically through the marriage practices of monopolistic trade guilds.

Specifically, people putting depilatory chemicals in shampoo, laxatives in brownies, and itching powder in underwear drawers.</p><p>(Once, as a teenager, I threatened my father with the latter; he was not amused.)</p><p>When I think about laxatives, I usually think of thick pink liquid, like what comes in a bottle of Pepto Bismal. If I&apos;m reading a fantasy novel, I expect some kind of potion or herbal tea.</p><p>I don&apos;t expect milk.</p><p>But one of the interesting little tidbits <a href=\"https://eleanorkonik.com/book-review-tamed/\">I learned from <em>Tamed </em>by Alice Roberts</a> is that the Romans used exactly that as a laxative.</p><p>Lactose tolerance is relatively rare in adult humans, looked at globally. It&apos;s mostly a European phenomenon even now, and it&apos;s recent. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-49650806\" rel=\"noopener\">Scientists have done genetic studies</a> of ancient populations across Eurasia. It turns out that even though we have evidence that Neolithic humans ate milk products (like <a href=\"https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/cheese/\">cheese</a>), the genetic mutation that lets people drink milk without getting stomach aches is new. Like Bronze Age new, and even then, only about 5-10% of Europeans were lactose tolerant.</p><p>By the time the first century BCE rolled around, Roman scholars were still making lists of which types of milk were the most effective laxatives. Since mare&apos;s milk has such high lactose content, it&apos;s recommended for medicinal use. Next most effective were donkey&apos;s milk, cow&apos;s milk, then goat&apos;s milk -- which is usually described as being gentler on the stomach, at least in parenting circles.</p><p>That was only 2,000 years ago. Adult lactose tolerance is pretty common in Europe now, but less than 30% of adults in Kazakhstan are lactose tolerant. Kazakhstan, tucked between southern Russia and western China right up to the Caspian Sea, is incidentally the homeland of apples and a bunch of other delicious fruits. Apparently the forests are beautiful, but I digress.</p><p>I was talking about laxatives.</p><p>Milk obviously wasn&apos;t the only substance used as a laxative in the pre-industrial world. Senna was a popular herbal remedy. It&apos;s <a href=\"https://www.civilwarmed.org/senna/\" rel=\"noopener\">described as</a> having a &quot;urine yellow color&quot; with a &quot;fragrant and sickening odor.&quot; It tastes &quot;nauseous and bitter.&quot; In fact, it was apparently the perfect laxative (effective but not dangerous) except for the taste. Since it tasted so bad, it was usually mixed with tamarind, sugar, coriander, or ginger. It had to be taken with lots of water.</p><p>Senna was usually given as an infusion (like tea), not a tincture (highly concentrated &#x2014; think vanilla extract). Tinctures don&apos;t have enough liquid to be effective as laxatives. Instead, it would be made into a syrup, a powder (mixed with coffee, but hard to get the dosage right), or a sugary confection (great for pregnant women, but hard to make).</p><p><a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/digestive-health/herbal-remedies-for-constipation#3.-Rhubarb\" rel=\"noopener\">Rhubarb</a> is an alternative, but a weird one. It has laxative <em><em>and</em></em> anti-diarrhea effects, due to its tannin content. A bunch of my friends like the pie, so I was startled to learn this. Rhubarb is easy to grow and doesn&apos;t have to be replanted every year, so I&apos;ve considered planting some in my garden, but honestly the amount of sugar you need to make it palatable is a bit of a turn-off for me.</p><p>There are others, but what most herbal laxatives have in common is how they work. They mostly stimulate the intestines (i.e., make them contract) and draw fluid into the colon, which helps things move along.</p><p>And help people like Julea solve other problems, too.</p>",

She couldn&apos;t let the rorgoten spread to the forest, not with the walnut harvest so soon, and who knew when Widow Mack would come out to check her beans? The old woman was moving slower and slower every year; Innalie could count the crabgrass clumps in amongst her strawberries, even from here.</p><p>Properly speaking, rorgoten required the power of a trained alchemist to banish. Innalie was just a laundress, but she was the closest the village had to a proper mage; her grandma had actually met an alchemist, once.</p><p>Innalie closed her eyes, then shook herself and carried her gather-basket to the widow&apos;s fence. Black, slimy gunk clung to every leaf and stalk of Widow Mack&apos;s garden, eating her fresh beans with a vigor unmatched in nature &#x2014; Innalie could <em>see</em> it spreading.</p><p>Rorgoten was biological at its base, or else it wouldn&apos;t smell so much like rot. The best way she knew to get rid of grass stains was with a bit of alcohol and a bit of scrubbing.</p><p>Innalie uncapped her canteen and poured a splash of ale onto the nearest. It started bubbling, each &apos;pop&apos; loud enough to make her muscles clench. The stench intensified, a miasma thick enough to coat the back of her throat.</p><p>&quot;What are you doing in my garden, you horrible girl!&quot; the widow screeched from the window.</p><p>Damn. She hadn&apos;t even hopped the fence yet.</p><p>&quot;I smelled some rorgoten and came to see if I could help,&quot; Innalie said, trying to placate the old woman.</p><p>Widow Mack&apos;s furious expression didn&apos;t relax. &quot;You&apos;ve got some nerve coming here&#x2014;&quot; Her voice trailed off as she moved away from the window and toward the door.</p><p>Guilt clawed at Innalie&apos;s throat; she certainly hadn&apos;t meant for Trent to get wrapped up in fighting the endless border wars that sprang up after the Cult of Valor burned Aelipolis and all the proper mages fled east. He was nice enough, but at sixteen-and-change, Innalie was no more interested in stepping out with him than she was in cavorting with a goat. For the most part she tolerated boys the way she tolerated snakes&#x2014;useful enough, here in the countryside. Not too dangerous, most of the time, but it took a very particular person to want to touch one and she wasn&apos;t that kind of girl.</p><p>Which did nothing to stop Widow Mack from blaming Innalie for the fact that her only son had gone off and left her, all alone. The old woman stormed out onto the little pebble path Innalie had helped Trent mortar into place, one summer when they were still too young to be anything but friends. &quot;No better than you ought to be, Innalie Watson, sneaking into my garden to steal my beans!&quot;</p><p>Innalie&apos;s lips tightened. Her family may have been poor, since her father died, but they&apos;d never been thieves.</p><p>No sense trying to defend her honor. &quot;You&apos;ve got rorgoten in your garden, Mrs. Mack! Can&apos;t you smell it? I&apos;m trying to get it gone for you.&quot; Without waiting for a response, Innalie reached into her basket and pulled out a skin of milk, fresh that morning from her sister&apos;s goat and intended for scrubbing fruit stains out of linen. Innalie breathed boiling magic into it lukewarm liquid; it steamed when it spilled onto the beans.</p><p>Where the milk touched the rorgoten, the sticky tendrils turned lemonbleach-white. Innalie smiled grimly. Milk wouldn&apos;t be enough to get rid of the rorgoten, but she was getting the sense of it now.</p><p>Mrs. Mack stormed out of the house, the front of her apron dusted with flour handprints. She gasped when she got close enough to see the rorgoten coating her beans. &quot;How did that get here?&quot;</p><p>Innalie shrugged helplessly. &quot;I don&apos;t know, Mrs. Mack, but I&apos;m going to get rid of it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You?&quot; Mrs. Mack sneered. &quot;You&apos;re no alchemist, girl. Not even on your best day.&quot;</p><p>Innalie kept her face meek. &quot;No ma&apos;am.&quot; She wished she had a jug of paraffin oil. But paraffin was expensive, and her little bit of hedge magic was usually enough without it, so she poured a bit of milk over her hand and infused it with a bit of <em>boil</em> and a bit of <em>dry</em>, and sprinkled the mix of magic over the bean patch. &quot;I&apos;m just the town laundress.&quot;<br><br>But even so, the rorgoten calcified and crumbled to dust.</p><p>Widow Mack gasped.</p><p>&quot;Do you want me to come and take care of the rest?&quot; Innalie asked. She had to work hard to keep the bite out of her voice.</p><p>&quot;Alchemist ain&apos;t got any business being in this village, girl. Git on with you before the Cultists come!&quot;</p><p>&quot;But the rorgoten&#x2014;&quot;</p><p>&quot;Probably your fault it&apos;s here, pfhaw. Trying to play the hero, girl? Well I won&apos;t have any of it, not after what you did to my boy.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Have it your way, then!&quot; Innalie snatched up her basket and stormed back into the forest.</p><p>It took three days for Widow Mack to come begging Innalie&apos;s grandma to send &quot;that girl&quot; to get rid of the stench. Half the village came out to watch her cleanse the rorgoten, but by then, the spiderweb roots of its mycelium network had eaten its way halfway through the house&apos;s foundation.</p><p>When Trent finally got leave and brought his new wife to visit home, Widow Mack was still rebuilding. By then, though, Innalie had already moved away, with her sister and the goat, when her sister wed a blacksmith from two towns over.</p><p>Innalie got very good at cleaning coalstains out of leather.</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h2 align=\"center\">Analysis</h2><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>I&apos;ve written about <a href=\"https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/laundry/\">laundry</a> and <a href=\"https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/furtive/\">rorgoten</a> before, but <em>The Laundress &amp; the Fungal Growth</em> goes a bit more in depth about how I feel about laundry.</p><p>Which is to say that I&apos;ve come to believe the art of getting clothes clean is basically magic. </p><p> When I was growing up, my mom worked as a dry cleaner. I think she&apos;d been a factory seamstress before that, but I only remember the smell of dry cleaning chemicals and occasional summer days visiting the hot presses where she worked, in downtown Baltimore.</p><p>I had a very different upbringing than either of my parents. Like most parents, I think, they wanted better for me than what they&apos;d had. For us, that meant a life with less manual labor, so I didn&apos;t have many chores growing up. Often when I did try to help out, I would mess something up and not be allowed to do it anymore. Once, I tried to help out and wash my dad&apos;s work shirts. I didn&apos;t shake them out well enough before hanging them up, and they wound up really wrinkled. I still remember how upset my mom was, and the end result was that it took me close to a decade before I ever did anyone else&apos;s laundry.</p><p>These days I&apos;m married with a kid, and if I&apos;m being honest my husband does as much of the housework as I do if not more, but cloth diapering taught me <em>so much</em> about laundry. I&apos;ve always thought that &quot;doing laundry correctly&quot; was a skill that has kind of been lost in middle-class American culture, thanks to washing machines and fast fashion. Sort of like changing your own oil or mending your own socks, I guess. But even kind of knowing that, I was startled at how <em>true</em> that emotion was.</p><p>Laundry is magic.</p><p>When we decided to cloth diaper our son, I threw myself into research about how to do it correctly.</p><p>Cotton is widely considered the best fabric for the absorbent layer because it&apos;s soft, readily available, and very absorbent. Wool, which is also very absorbent although the oils repels liquid at first, is often used as the outer, leakproof layer. Wool is magical because it doesn&apos;t get cold when it&apos;s wet. Some people use hyperabsorbent modern materials like microfiber in lieu of cotton, but they tradeoff is that while yes they can absorb a lot of liquid, they also compress and spill more easily.</p><p>Of course, once these fabrics have absorbed a bunch of excrement, cleaning them can be a challenge. You can&apos;t wash wool in regular detergent or you&apos;ll strip the lanolin (natural oil) out. When you do wash it, in special lanolin-rich soap, it smells like a sheep until it dries.</p><p>Hard water is &quot;hard&quot; because it has a bunch of dissolved minerals in it. &quot;Soft&quot; water is really just &quot;pure&quot; water, but it turns out the amount of dissolved minerals has a huge impact on how well detergent works. If water is too hard, it can form a scummy film or leave spots of dissolved minerals behind once it dries. Soft water is less &quot;abrasive&quot; than hard water which, despite what every &quot;buy our water softener!&quot; vendor will tell you, actually can make it harder to rinse things clean, especially with a high-efficiency machine.</p><p>Then there&apos;s the whole &quot;enzymes matter&quot; thing, which is to say that most respectable cloth diapering communities spend a lot of time explaining to people that you can&apos;t wash human excrement in a washing machine with lavender-water and expect it to come clean. There are reams of articles out there explaining <a href=\"https://www.goingzerowaste.com/blog/why-you-should-never-make-laundry-detergent/\" rel=\"noopener\">the difference between soap and detergent</a>. When soap accumulates in textiles it makes them repel water, which in the case of baby diapers (or towels) is pretty terrible.</p><p>If you wind up with a bunch of soap buildup in textiles there are <a href=\"https://fortheloveofclean.com/laundry-love/homemade-detergent/testimonials-from-former-users-of-homemade-soap-photo-gallery/\" rel=\"noopener\">whole processes for &quot;stripping&quot; out built up soapscum</a> with borax and some other stuff.</p><p>What I&apos;m getting at here is that in order to really do laundry well, over the long term, you wind up learning a <em>lot</em> more chemistry than people necessarily realize, and that&apos;s the phenomenon I wanted to get at with <em>The Laundress and the Fungal Growth</em>. Innalie may not have the fancy city education expected of a &quot;real alchemist,&quot; but she certainly knows her way around magichemistry! </p><h2 id=\"further-reading\"><strong><strong>Further Reading</strong></strong></h2><ul><li>If you want to read a really awesome historical fantasy series where a laundress plays a starring role, written by a longtime historical reenactor whose wife reenacts as a laundress, check out the <a href=\"https://christiancameronauthor.com/book-series/traitor-son-cycle/\" rel=\"noopener\">Traitor Son Cycle</a> by Miles Cameron.

Conversely, you can install the new <a href=\"https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat\">BRAT</a> plugin and just input the repository&apos;s URL. Note, though, that this is <strong>not as safe</strong> as waiting for them to go through code review.

          "content": "<p>I&apos;m sending you this email on a Sunday (not a usual newsletter day) because I found a corner case with my newsletter provider (Ghost) that led my subscriber database to become hopelessly corrupted. Don&apos;t panic &#x2014; the only people really hurt by this are myself and my poor husband, who spent about a week helping me track down the problem and try to troubleshoot bug reports and potential solutions.</p><p><strong>The tl;dr is that if you probably won&apos;t be able to log in to The Iceberg and The Obsidian Roundup for at least part of today. All paid subscriber accounts for The Iceberg (and probably some for the Obsidian Roundup, I haven&apos;t been able to run tests because of technical reasons) are about to be flagged with a free, complementary, lifetime subscription to whichever of my newsletters I have a record of you having subscribed to.</strong></p><p>The records are hopelessly entertwined, though, so if you could double-check sometime, say, Monday or Tuesday, to make sure your account(s) are set up the way it should be, that would be great.</p><p>If you&apos;re annoyed you didn&apos;t win this delightful lottery for the Obsidian Roundup, I have good news: it was always free (sorry if that wasn&apos;t obvious &#x1F605; I tried to make it clear but I was bad at modifying themes in the early days) and you can cancel your subscription any time and still get the information via email, RSS, or just visiting the website once a week. For obvious reasons I kind of hope you don&apos;t, though, since my monthly revenue is about to get slashed to the ground &#x1F643;</p><p>If you feel bad about this and would like to give me money anyway (I use it for supporting other developers, paying for tech support and themes, and things like book covers / editing &#x2014; not food. I am not going to starve because of this, please don&apos;t worry about anything except my sanity), I&apos;ll share some steps down below for workarounds, but first, let me tell you what happened because otherwise it won&apos;t make sense what you&apos;re working around.</p><p>Buckle up, it&apos;s a mess.</p><h2 id=\"first-there-were-none\"><strong><strong>First There Were None</strong></strong></h2><p>The Iceberg began life as a mailing list run off of the free tier of mailerlite, and for the first eight months or so it was called &quot;the Monday Morning Research Roundup&quot; and this was fine. But I found myself wanting to link to past issues when they came up in conversation, and the mailerlite link preview mechanism was a little awkward and painful. I eventually heard of substack, but I also heard there were some controversies, and I didn&apos;t really like the lack of customization options or want to be permanently associated with the substack brand, which I have no control over. I&apos;d heard of Ghost, but wasn&apos;t really ready to switch over to it, because switching is always harder than starting from scratch.</p><p>So when a member of the Obsidian.md Discord server asked for a newsletter to help summarize major developments in the Obsidian community &#x2014; where the state of the meta can charge a lot in just a few days, as plugins get made, themes get updated, and workflows get shared pretty constantly &#x2014; I jumped on the chance to learn more about running a newsletter on Ghost.</p><h2 id=\"to-self-host-or-not-to-self-host\"><strong><strong>To Self Host or Not to Self Host</strong></strong></h2><p>There was always a possibility that other people might help out with the Roundup &#x2014; what if I went back to work and couldn&apos;t maintain it, or got pregnant and needed to take a couple of months off, or it made sense to run two editions of it? At the time I was setting up the Roundup it would have cost $80/mo for managed hosting that let me have one additional user, because the tier that allowed for it was intended at big group newsletter consortiums and newsrooms. I assumed (somewhat naively in retrospect, you all are amazing) that I would be paying for the hosting costs totally out of pocket and was leery of committing that much money to something I wasn&apos;t sure would ever see more than 20 readers (the original target audience was Discord regulars who had gone on vacation and wanted to catch up quickly).</p><p>Most newsletters cap their free tiers at 1000 users, and I was hopeful that my personal newsletter might one day surpass that, so it seemed like a good opportunity to try out what was, to the best of my knowledge, the cheapest decent way to run a newsletter.</p><p>I was a little nervous about self-hosting, but I&apos;ve been self-hosting Wordpress for years with only minimal problems&#x2014; (like the one time I ran an update that made it impossible for me to actually access my website from the web at all &#x1F643;) &#x2014; and, well, the Obsidian community is full of helpful developers so I figured that if I ran into too big of a pickle, somebody would help me out. It was to be a grand experiment!</p><h2 id=\"it-went-pretty-well\"><strong><strong>It Went Pretty Well</strong></strong></h2><p>Honestly <a href=\"https://eleanorkonik.com/ghost-my-experiences-running-a-self-hosted-newsletter/\" rel=\"noopener\">the problems I ran into with setting up Ghost</a> weren&apos;t that bad. I wouldn&apos;t recommend it to non-technical users, but I was right about being able to lean on my community for help and I learned a lot. I learned how to edit SCSS so I could change the theme, I learned about how email <em>really</em> works, I learned how to use a terminal to access a server, it was pretty cool. A bit over my head at times, but I&apos;m married to a professional software developer and in some ways it was kind of a neat bonding experience.</p><p>So I went ahead and made my fatal mistake.</p><h2 id=\"a-tale-of-two-ghosts\"><strong><strong>A Tale of Two Ghosts</strong></strong></h2><p>When I installed Ghost for the Roundup, I used the one-click installer for Digital Ocean and it went... mostly fine. But I&apos;d heard that you could run more than one thing on a single Digital Ocean server and felt pretty dumb for paying $6/mo per server when I thought I didn&apos;t need to, so I asked my husband for help putting my worldbuilding research newsletter &#x2014; now rebranded as <a href=\"http://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/\">the Iceberg</a> so I didn&apos;t have two Roundups &#x2014; on the same droplet (server). I wanted this mostly because I wanted them both to be under the same domain name, which is to say the newsletter would be a subdomain of <a href=\"http://eleanorkonik.com/\">eleanorkonik.com</a> where I write my articles. </p><p>This was super complicated and without going into more details, a terrible idea because we wound up having to upgrade the server size anyway, otherwise I ran out of memory and had horrible performance. There were easier ways to do this and I should have used them because economies of scale a real thing. Anyway I&apos;m committed to this path now and happily, doing it this way didn&apos;t actually break anything &#x2014; I swear.</p><p>No, my big mistake was thinking that the Roundup and the Iceberg were both &quot;products&quot; under my &quot;Eleanor Konik&quot; brand and therefore <em>related from a business perspective</em>.</p><h2 id=\"enter-stripe\"><strong><strong>Enter, Stripe.</strong></strong></h2><p>Stripe is the credit card processor that handles payments for Ghost newsletters and Obsidian, too. To the best of my knowledge they have the cheapest processing fees and are therefore pretty popular. On their FAQ, they&apos;re pretty clear that you should use separate &quot;business accounts&quot; (inside of your &quot;dashboard&quot; account) for unrelated businesses. But to my mind, the Roundup and the Iceberg are related insofar as they&apos;re the two of the three things that most strongly &quot;build my brand,&quot; the latter being the articles I share on my wordpress site.</p><p>I uh, I don&apos;t know if you know this, but Eleanor Konik isn&apos;t my real name. I&apos;m a middle school teacher do you think I want kids Googling how to find my Discord contact details?</p><p>Anyway, the Ghost interface let me connect the Iceberg membersehips to a product called &quot;The Iceberg&quot; under my Eleanorkonik account on Stripe and all seemed fine. Some of the numbers seemed a little weird (which is to say: low) at first, but I&apos;m kind of bad at remembering numbers and figured I was just doing the mental math wrong for how the yearly discount was lowering the price and of course there are Stripe fees... but eventually I realized:</p><p>Wait no, something is really wrong.</p><p>Specifically, Stripe was reporting a monthly recurring revenue amount that was roughly a third of what Ghost was reporting and by the end of the first month of the Iceberg having a paid tier for extra content, aka short fiction and analysis pieces a little more &quot;open&quot; than I would normally be on the internet, there was enough expected revenue that the numbers were big enough for me to notice the discrepancy.</p><h2 id=\"missing-subscribers\"><strong><strong>Missing Subscribers</strong></strong></h2><p>Around this time, Stripe was reporting about 20 recurring subscribers to the Iceberg while Ghost was reporting closer to 90. Crap! So I checked the Roundup, thinking that maybe they&apos;d somehow gotten sent over there.</p><p>Well, that was definitely part of it! Some of the subscribers to the $2 tier of the Iceberg had been charged for the $1 Roundup &quot;product.&quot; But I also had about 15 fewer paid subscribers to the Roundup in the Stripe &#x2014; definitely people missing, but a different percentage. How strange. All told, there were fifty people who Ghost thought were subscribed but Stripe had <em>no record of</em>.</p><p>Which is bad.</p><p>For what I hope are obvious reasons but totally aside from the missing money I was terrified that this cross-pollination between newsletters was breaking people&apos;s accounts, and it definitely meant that every time I logged in and was confronted with the Ghost dashboard that I can&apos;t (easily) change (well, I can but it won&apos;t persist between updates and would be a nightmare) to turn off the money/membership tracking information, I was confronted with these weird, unreliable numbers, which drove me kind of nuts and made it hard to focus on creating content for y&apos;all.</p><p>It was frankly demoralizing. </p><h2 id=\"tech-support\"><strong><strong>Tech Support</strong></strong></h2><p>I reached out to Stripe first, since Stripe actually makes money from these transactions and Ghost is pretty up front about self-hosting being an unsupported option intended for skilled developers who are expected to figure out their own solutions to problems (although I&apos;ve always gotten help when I showed up hat in hand to help, I have done enough tier one tech support for Obsidian that I wanted to be able to give them a comprehensive bug report if it came to that).</p><p>Stripe has a helpful little chat button on the dashboard, but when I clicked it and tried to share information with the nice tier one tech support person, I immediately ran into a problem (because of course I did, are you getting a feel for this yet?). The chat software wouldn&apos;t let me upload attachments, even though the functionality was right there and the file sizes I was using were tiny. So we had to switch to email, which is much clunkier, but turned out to be fine because all tier one tech support could really do was acknowledge that something sure was hinky and assure me that they were forwarding my problem to tier two tech support, aka someone who could help.</p><p>Eventually.</p><p>After I hadn&apos;t heard anything from Stripe for a couple of days &#x2014; and after talking through things with some of the Obsidian moderators and nice folks in the Ghost community &#x2014; I decided I had enough information file a bug report with Ghost. You can read it <a href=\"https://forum.ghost.org/t/incorrect-billing-amounts-with-multiple-instances-of-ghost/25415\" rel=\"noopener\">in all its earnest glory</a> on their forum if you&apos;re so inclined.</p><p>Basically, I finally had a theory: connecting two stripe products under the same <em>account name</em> to two different ghost newsletters is a weird corner case that you&apos;re supposed to be smart enough to not do and also who seriously runs two tonally different newsletters under the same &quot;branding&quot; effort, anyway?</p><p>&#x1F633;</p><h2 id=\"the-hope\"><strong><strong>The Hope</strong></strong></h2><p>Around this time, Stripe got back to me with a variation of &quot;hey sorry this sounds like a Ghost problem, not an us problem,&quot; which... seemed true, honestly, so I didn&apos;t push.</p><p>By this point I had an inkling of a plan: I could nuke the database for the Iceberg back to the ground, reset to 0 MRR. But wouldn&apos;t it be nice if I didn&apos;t have to? If I could somehow prune back just the corrupted/incorrect stuff and keep the <em>accurate</em> records of subscriptions, then export it, disconnect stripe from Ghost, move the stripe product over to a new account like I should have done in the first place apparently, and then reimport?</p><p>Alas, the kind staffers at Ghost dashed my dreams. Again, they are not actually making a cent off of me using their software, I am a free rider, I hold them no will-will whatsoever, broadly speaking Ghost is an amazing program that does what I want it to do, which is connect with you all &#x2014; and looks pretty slick, too!</p><p>The staffers shared a link: somebody back in March ran into a similar problem... except much worse &#x1F62C; I think their subscribers were erroneously getting charged for <em>expensive</em> things. From what I can tell everyone impacted by this on my end got billed <em>less </em>than they signed up for, i.e. the Roundup price instead of the Iceberg price (differention is the main reason they&apos;re different prices, by the way. I&apos;m not totally stupid). Anyway, the solution to this problem was basically &quot;well, you can manually delete one by one, or if you&apos;re comfortable with databases, you can nuke it all at once using mysql.&quot;</p><p>Yay?</p><h2 id=\"a-learning-experience\"><strong><strong>A Learning Experience</strong></strong></h2><p>So I spent all night Friday looking at the mysql databases in Ghost. Which is to say, my husband showed me how to do mysql queries of a database via the command-line terminal for my server. Then we cross-referenced the member information and product information and emails against the Stripe database. We used a frankly exhausting combination of Excel sheets and vlookups, which I had never heard of, but I guess might ever come in handy if I need to do something else complicated in excel one day. <a href=\"https://eleanorkonik.com/3-theses-3rd-thursday-managing-things/\">Perhaps I&apos;ll figure out pivot tables, yet</a>! </p><p>Once we had the data laid out in front of us (which took roughly three hours) we were able to confirm that the problem started happening around the time I hooked up the Iceberg to Stripe. We were also able to confirm that subscribers to the Iceberg who were <em>only</em> subscribed to the Iceberg (and were not paying for the Roundup) had corrupted data, i.e. were listed as customers of the Roundup in Stripe&apos;s database.</p><p>For those still following along at home (or wherever, I guess), this is bad because it means I can&apos;t just delete the Iceberg product and move on with my life &#x2014; the list of subscribers to the Obsidian Roundup product in Stripe is <em>also</em> incorrect.</p><h2 id=\"the-faint-hope\"><strong><strong>The Faint Hope</strong></strong></h2><p>Now that I my husband understood how the Ghost database worked, we had a dim hope that we could maybe hack Ghost to let us disconnect from stripe <em>without</em> having deleted all of the member subscription data, but it would only work if Stripe could be convinced to help. Which was frankly unlikely, there are super good reasons that you&apos;re not supposed to mess around with that data &#x2014; it&apos;s a great way to corrupt your database &#x1F643;</p><p>But come on. At this point it was worth a shot, right?</p><p>So I reached out to my point of contact at Stripe in the faint hope that they could somehow move the uncorrupted stuff over to a new product on the new account (or the old product onto the new account, whatever) but alas, it was not possible.</p><p>Which brings me to the reason for this email.</p><h2 id=\"nuking-the-database\"><strong><strong>Nuking the Database</strong></strong></h2><p>The only way I can figure out to resolve this is to delete all of the Iceberg&apos;s paid subscribers, disconnect from Stripe, delete all of the Iceberg-related entries in Stripe, create a new Stripe product under a new subaccount thing, re-connect to Stripe, re-import all of my paid subscribers, and then go through and manually give everyone a complementary subscription. I may or may not need to do the same thing to the Obsidian Roundup membership database (I give it 80% odds), but either way it&apos;s going to involve a lot of cross-checks and on-the-fly troubleshooting.</p><p><strong>If you are subscribed to The Iceberg and do not get the free Monday morning email that summarizes my research into obscure historical and biological facts about <em>cheese</em> please view it on <a href=\"http://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">the website</a> instead. If you don&apos;t get an email <em>next</em> week, please reach out to me so I can fix whatever has gone wrong.</strong> I have every intention of having this fixed before I go to bed tonight, but just in case, I want there to be a workaround available. I should in theory have this fixed by the time the next Roundup goes out, but if not, please send beer and babysitters. </p><h2 id=\"upgrading-from-complementary\"><strong><strong>Upgrading from Complementary</strong></strong></h2><p>The only problem with giving everyone a complementary yearly subscription is that there is literally no way I can find for users to cancel this subscription or upgrade to a paid subscription in any rational way. If you cancel the complementary subscription, it will run out <em>this time next year</em> at which point you&apos;ll just ... stop getting premium emails, I guess. I have no way if knowing if you&apos;ll get warned about this, because for obvious reasons I can&apos;t wait a year for testing &#x1F643; there is no monthly complementary subscription option.</p><p>The design of Ghost sort of assumes that you&apos;re doing one very specific thing and if you try to do something other than that one specific thing, you&apos;re on your own.</p><p>So! Workarounds. They&apos;re painful, but I promised:</p><p>In theory you can just make a new account with a different email address, if you&apos;re like me and have multiple email accounts filtering into the same inbox, and then pick an account to &quot;unsubscribe from emails&quot; from. Bonus points if you send me an email with the account you&apos;d like me to delete from my end, because hahaha I discovered during the course of this that <a href=\"https://forum.ghost.org/t/letting-members-delete-their-accounts/20187\" rel=\"noopener\">you can&apos;t delete your subscriber account in Ghost</a>... and I&apos;d prefer not to have duplicate accounts giving me a bloated number for how many folks are signed up, since I have this dream of launching on ProductHunt if I ever get to a thousand members for the Iceberg.</p><p>If you&apos;re a one-email-for-life kind of person, you can (<strong>tomorrow please</strong>) log in to your newsletter of choice by either:</p><ul><li><em>Make sure javascript is enabled</em> (if you don&apos;t know what that means, you&apos;re fine) and click the <code>+ Membership</code> (the Iceberg) or the Subscribe (Obsidian Roundup) button, click sign in, follow the directions, get back to that section (the account modal will be your gravatar icon) and change your email there.</li><li>If you don&apos;t want to enable javascript because you don&apos;t trust Ghost (...fair), you can click the <code>Sign in</code> button at the top, <code>change billing information</code> and then click &quot;back&quot; at which point it will finally let you edit your email address. &#x1F643; Want to guess how long that took me to figure out?</li></ul><p>Once you&apos;re able to change your email address of record, make a dummy account like <code>deleteme28365@sharklasers.com</code> (don&apos;t literally use that one). <a href=\"https://www.sharklasers.com/\">Sharklasers.com</a> is great for throwaway accounts, but you do need to be able to check the inbox once so you can confirm the email you&apos;re switching your complementary account to. Then, in theory, you can create a <em>new</em> account with your real email (the one you&apos;ve been using all this time) and whatever subscription you feel like signing up for. <strong>Please do not feel like you need to do this. I am fine if you stay on the complementary email, triply so if you have a credit card statement saying you paid me. If you paid through Stripe and your credit card reflects this, I probably did actually get the money. Only some payments were underpaid or lost in the ether.</strong></p><p>I am including this section because I expect questions about it and in an effort to be thorough, because you are all so nice, not because I need this money to not starve. I will not starve because of this. It&apos;s just bad for my ego and might just take a little longer to save up for a fancy book cover, which is fine. Honestly, I&apos;m gratified to have readers at all, and the nicest thing you can do for me is share my newsletters and articles with friends who might be interested in the content (<strong>tomorrow please</strong>), or reach out with a link if you come across something you think <em>I</em> might find interesting.</p><p>That said, if you&apos;d like to sponsor my work but no longer trust my Ghost database (which is ... fair), you&apos;re welcome to <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/eleanorkonik\" rel=\"noopener\">sponsor me on GitHub</a>. If you didn&apos;t have a pre-existing subscription, but would like one and don&apos;t trust my Ghost database (also fair!) just shoot me an email after sponsoring me on GitHub and I&apos;ll give you a complementary lifetime subscription too. We&apos;ll call it Early Bird Pricing &#x1F54A;&#xFE0F;&#x1F643;</p><h2 id=\"end-of-the-line\"><strong><strong>End of the Line</strong></strong></h2><p>If you made it this far, thanks for listening to my tale of woe. Wish me luck!</p><p>I&apos;ll try to send a (much shorter) email once I think everything is working as expected.</p>",

I didn&apos;t pick it up at first because I didn&apos;t feel qualified, but now I&apos;ve got <a href=\"http://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/\">The Iceberg</a>, my weekly newsletter where I share short fiction &amp; the nerdy history &amp; obscure biology research that supports the stories. It&apos;s doing pretty well, and apparently almost 50 people want to hear the talk, so I decided to go ahead and get over my imposter syndrome. Expect it sometime next month. </p><p>Anyway, I figured I ought to spruce up my workflow documentation in preparation. That&apos;s how last week&apos;s article about <a href=\"https://eleanorkonik.com/the-konik-philosophy-of-gardening-digital-otherwise/\">the gardening metaphor for notetaking</a> got started. This week, I set out to update my &quot;How I use Obsidian for Writing&quot; article to sort of consolidate all of the different quirks of my personal knowledge management system. It ... got bigger than I expected.</p><p>You can see the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EleanorKonik/status/1429850365747466248\">saga of how the article metastasized on Twitter</a> but since apparently I&apos;m writing a book (16,000 words and counting in under a week!) and I don&apos;t know a ton about nonfiction publishing, if you <em>do</em> I would love recommendations / referrals for things like decent nonfiction copy editors, resources for typesetting, viable alternatives to Amazon, etc. </p><p>Thanks!</p>",
