Ironworkers took this specialization to an extreme, creating so many taboos and rituals that they monopolized the skill, creating guilds. Leather workers, potters and other tradesmen started doing the same thing. They wanted to make sure their grandkids continued in the tradition and started marrying their kids to each other. So basically, one way castes can develop is basically through the marriage practices of monopolistic trade guilds. (<a href=\"https://www.upress.virginia.edu/title/2705\" rel=\"noopener\">Source</a>)</p><h2 id=\"tradition-keepers\"><strong><strong>Tradition Keepers</strong></strong></h2><p>Wives who marry into a foreign tribe often feel so &quot;exposed and insecure&quot; that they start imitating the social norms of their adopted culture with exacting precision. This is important because it offers a counterpoint to the idea that intermarriage between tribal groups might be a reason for changes in culture.

The chiefs would contract marriage alliances with many families in different places in order to give those families a stake in the &quot;new order.&quot; The rise of cattle-keeping also led directly to the elimination of women as chiefs.

The harem of a prosperous household would include wives and/or concubines. Concubines were relatively high status, but technically slaves. Once they had a child they couldn&apos;t be sold, and they were freed upon their husband&apos;s death. As the power of the Ottomans grew, sultans stopped taking wives entirely; subsequent rulers were all the children of concubines.</p><hr><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div class=\"infobox\">If you found this interesting, you may also enjoy <a href=\"https://eleanorkonik.com/failed-marriages-folklore/\">my article about failed marriages in folklore</a>.</div><!--kg-card-end: html-->",
