than the stressors ^wrht21\n\t- Adrenaline hits in seconds and lasts for minutes\n\t- Cortisol hits within the hour and last for 4-24 hours\n\t\t- Basically keeps you on guard so that you're easier to wake from sleep, more aware, etc.\n\t- These we formed for physical forms of stress (tigers) but now effect us even for mental stressors \n##### Our brains design\n- our brains are not designed for correcting the dissonance between thoughts and conclusions ^7qn6tt\n\t- our brains are designed to make certainty out of uncertainty/find reasons for illogical decisions\n\t\t- if given too many options the brain will make choices that we cannot immediately understand the reasons for\n\t- if we get paralyzed through lack of knowledge we won't act \n\t\t- existential dread comes from the knowledge that we are ignorant/can't fully understand the world\n#####\n- [[neurosis]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neurosis) -> the tendency to worry\n\t- as a human, a lot of what is good for us makes us suffer\n\t\t- most professional success comes from conscientiousness and neuroticism \n- [[five-factor model]]\n- [[neuroticism]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neuroticism) -> sometimes defined as a tendency for quick arousal when stimulated and slow relaxation from arousal, especially with regard to negative emotional arousal.\n\t- Is a trait in many models within personality theory, but there is significant disagreement on its definition\n- [Conscientiousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness) -> the personality trait of being careful, or diligent. \n\t- Conscientiousness implies a [[desire]] to do a task well, and to take obligations to others seriously. \n\t- Conscientious people tend to be efficient and organized as opposed to easy-going and disorderly.\n- Difference between anxious thoughts vs a feeling of existential dread\n\t- Your feelings can manifest as thoughts\n\t- Feeling alone in the world can come from people fundamentally not understanding you at an early age\n##### The way the mind works \n- Mamos -> emotional mind\n\t- happens within 0-1s and then stores the emotional state\n\t- Examples\n\t\t- emotional\n\t\t- likes/dislikes\n\t\t- reacts\n\t\t- guttural\n\t\t- sense\n- Buddhi -> analytical mind\n\t- Processing emotions\n\t- using stored coping mechanisms to deal with stored emotional states\n\t- examples\n\t\t- \"just try it\"\n\t\t- \"experience new things\"\n##### Competence comes from empathic mirroring\n- [[Confidence]] problems come from when [[parents]] can't mirror the child's

[[free-will]]. This is important for a couple reasons, we must have the [[free-will]] to choose God's [[love]], and we must have the [[free-will]] to choose to sin. This is the basis of the genesis story and our \"sin nature.\" This belief is also the main reason [[Fear of hell is baked into Christianity]]. Hell is allowed to be such a horrible place because you choose to be in it by refusing god's grace.\n\nBecause [[free-will]] is so integral to loving god and avoiding punishment, it becomes a core part of the [[Christianity | christian]] [[worldview]], and when they see a non-believer they [[subconscious | subconsiously]] know that person has made the choice to go to hell and judge them for it (this is why [[Worldviews are wrong if they make life seem easy and simple]]) This plays a large part in the drive for evangelism and mission work, but it also changes [[Christianity|Christian]]'s relationships with others. \n\nHow can you love someone you know is condemned to death?

Cause for lack of concentration range from simple distraction, to illness's like [[depression]], to [[neurodiversity|neurodiverse]] minds. Here some ways that I have found to help concentrate:\n\n1. Interact with what you are trying to understand in more than one way. \n\t- If you are reading: write notes/highlight, and/or have it read aloud while you read. \n\t- If you are doing something, talk out loud what you are doing and how, in programming its called rubber duck debugging, but it can help you stay involved and notice problems. \n2. Eliminate distractions and make the only thing you do in your workspace work. If you work at an office this is easy, but if you work from home it can be as much as moving your monitor to the other side of you desk after work or working in one room and doing leisure in the other.\n3. Be willing to give yourself breaks, but try to do activities that will rest your brain instead of stimulate it. I.E go for a walk  or meditate instead of looking at social [[media]] for 20 mins.\n4. If it's possible and your lack of concentration is common reach out to your doctor to see if you can get a diagnosis and medication would help. For some, medication is the tool they need to survive and for others it is jumping off point for better habits.\n5. Look into [[mindfullness]] and [[meditation]]. It's okay to get frustrated and upset, but practices likes those help \n6. Find tools that reduce friction thus reducing required concentration, e.g [[Spaced repetition]]: [[Friction is the number one hindrance to learning]]\n\n### <hr class=\"footnote\"/>\n\n**Status**:: #EVER/GREEN \n*edited `=this.file.mtime`*\n\n**Topics**:: [[mental health]], [[How ADHD effects concentration]]\n*`$=customJS.dv_funcs.outlinedIn(dv, this)`*\n","created":"2021-05-02","tags":"node/evergreen","sr-due":"2021-12-16","sr-interval":42,"sr-ease":290,"degree":5,"nameLength":22},"position":{"x":905.2727272727274,"y":577.5},"group":"nodes","removed":false,"selected":false,"selectable":true,"locked":false,"grabbable":true,"pannable":false,"classes":"note tag-node tag-node-evergreen tag-EVER tag-EVER-GREEN hard-filtered global-1"},{"data":{"id":"core:Trans people will look for any other solution than being trans.md","name":"Trans people will look for any other solution than being trans","path":"40_Evergreens/Trans people will look for any other solution than being trans.md","content":"---\ncreated: 2021-08-08\ntags: node/evergreen\naliases:\n  - null\n---\n\n#### [[Trans people will look for any other solution than being trans]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`\n\nBecause [[Any experience of gender dysphoria is acceptable]] and [[Gender is both an intrinsic experience and an necessary expression]], many [[transgender|trans]] people will recognize the effects of [[gender dysphoria]] before they recognize the cause.
