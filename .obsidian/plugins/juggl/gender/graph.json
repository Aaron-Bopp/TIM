Depending on the context, these characteristics may include biological sex, sex-based social structures (i.e., [[gender]] roles), or [[gender identity]] (the personal sense of one's own [[gender]]).\n\nIf you trace the etymology of the word to its Latin roots, [[gender]] simply means “type”. The Norman [[France|French]] term **gendre** was in use in the 12th century to describe “the quality of being male or female.”\n\nMany people attribute the term to psychologist [John Money], who proposed using “[[gender]]” in 1955 to differentiate mental sex from physical sex. However, Money was not the first to do so. Cultural Anthropologist [Margaret Mead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Mead) used the term in 1949 in her book “Male and Female” to distinguish gendered behaviors and roles from biological sex. The American [[Journal]] of Psychology ([vol. 63, no. 2, 1950, pp. 312](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1418948)) described the book thusly:\n\n> A book, moreover, which gives beyond its premise; for it informs the reader upon **‘[[gender]]’ as well as upon ‘sex,’** upon masculine and feminine roles as well as upon male and female and their reproductive functions.\n> \n> Margaret Mead moves from the specific delineation to the more general comparison of male and female in several communities, finally coming to an analysis of sex-patterns in our own midst and for our own time.\n\n\n[@KatyMontgomerie](https://twitter.com/KatyMontgomerie) Magnus Hirschfield was writing about Third Genders and transitioning between sex and [[gender]] in the late 1800s.\n\nThis book of his, entitled \"What do people need to know about the Third [[Gender]]?\" was written in 1901.\n\nThis stuff isn't new, it was just sidelined.\n\n [![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EQ1IKINWkAAllKR.jpg?name=medium)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EQ1IKINWkAAllKR.jpg) \n\nHuman Sex (the adjective, not the verb) is broken down into three categories:\n[[Sex determines phenotype and genotype but not gender]]\n-  [[Def]]**[Genotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype)**: The genetically defined chromosomal kareotype of an organism (XX, XY, [and all variants there of](https://twitter.com/sciencevet2/status/1035250518870900737?lang=en))\n-  [[Def]] **[Phenotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype)**: The observable primary and secondary sexual characteristics (genitals, fat and muscle distribution, bone structure, etc)\n-  [[Def]] **[Gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender)**: The **un**observable sexual characteristics, the internal mental model of a person’s own sex and the way that they express it.\n\nAny of these three aspects can fall into a position on a range of values. Your elementary school health class probably taught you that Genotype is binary, either Female (XX) or Male (XY), when the reality is that there are a dozen other permutations that can occur within human beings.\n\n [![](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/bimodal-0e3e9b4bc1.png)](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/bimodal-0e3e9b4bc1.png) \n\nLikewise, many people believe that Phenotype is also binary, but biology has recognized for hundreds of years that when you plot out all sexual characteristics across a population, you actually end up with a bimodal distribution where the majority of the population falls within a percentile of two groups. This means that some people will, simply by nature of how life works, fall outside of the typical two piles. Many people fall in the middle, with characteristics of both sexes.\n\n[[Gender]], however, is a lot more… esoteric. There are a lot of different ways that people have attempted to illustrate the [[gender]] spectrum, but none have quite thoroughly captured it, because the spectrum is itself a very abstract concept.\n\n[[Any experience of gender is acceptable]] The short of it is, some people are very male, some people are very female, some people feel no [[gender]] at all, some people feel both, some are smack in the middle, some land along the edges. Some people oscillate all over the spectrum in unpredictable ways, changing like the wind. Only an individual can identify their own [[gender]], no one else can dictate it for them. ^iaqtza\n\n==[[Gender]] is part social construct, part learned behaviors, and part biological processes which form very early in a person’s life.==\n\n[[The scientific basis of gender]] ==Present evidence seems to suggest that a person’s [[gender]] is established during gestation while the cerebral cortex of the brain is forming== (more about that in the Causes of [[Gender Dysphoria]] section). This mental model then informs, at a [[subconscious]] level, what aspects of the [[gender]] spectrum a person will lean towards. It affects behavior, perceptions of the world, the way we experience attraction (separate from sexual orientation and hormonal influences) and how we bond with other people.\n\n[[Gender is both an intrinsic experience and an necessary expression]]\n\n[[gender]] also affects the expectations that the brain has for the environment it resides in (your body), and when that environment does not meet those expectations, the brain sends up warning alarms in the form of [[depression]], [[depersonalization]], [[derealization]], and [[dissociation]]. ==These are the brain’s [[subconscious]] ways of informing us that something is very wrong.==\n\n> [[Def]] **Habitus** - Socially ingrained habits, skills, and dispositions. The way a person perceives and reacts to the world.\n\nOn the social side, [[gender]] involves our [habitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitus_(sociology)): ==our presentation, our mannerisms and behaviors, how we communicate, how we react, what our expectations are from life, and the roles that we fulfill as we walk through life==. The author Susan Stryker described habitus it in her book [Transgender History](https://smile.amazon.com/Transgender-History-second-Todays-Revolution/dp/158005689X):\n\n> A lot of habitus involves manipulating our ==secondary sex characteristics to communicate to others our own sense of who we feel we are==—whether we sway our hips, talk with our hands, bulk up at the gym, grow out our hair, wearclothing with a neckline that emphasizes our cleavage, shave our armpits, allow stubble to be visible on our faces, or speak with a rising or falling inflection at the end of sentences. Often these ways of moving and styling have become so internalize that we think of them as natural even though—given that they are all things we’ve learned through observation and practice—they can be better understood as culturally acquired “second nature.”\n\nIndeed, these are all cultural factors; things which have developed within the population over time. Regardless of being essentially “made up”, they are still strongly gendered and a person tends to connect to the gendered habitus of their internal [[self]], without even realizing they are doing it. When we are denied access to those social aspects, this results in discomfort with one’s social position in life.\n\nJohn Money’s experiments attempted to confirm his belief that [[gender]] is entirely a social construct, and that any child can be raised to believe themselves to be whatever they were taught to be. His experiment was a massive failure (see the Biochemical Dysphoria section). [[Gender]] does not change, every human is the same [[gender]] at 40 that they were at 4. What changes is our own personal understanding of our [[gender]] as we mature as individuals.\n\nThese negative symptoms ([[depression]], [[derealization]], [[social discomfort]]) are the symptoms of [[gender dysphoria]].\n\nWhat **[[gender]] is _not_** is sexual orientation. We describe orientation using terms relative to one’s [[gender]] (homosexual/heterosexual/bisexual, etc), but [[gender]] itself does not affect sexuality and sexuality has no role in [[gender]].\n\n## What does it mean to be Non-Binary? \n[[non-binary]] can basically be simplified as a lack of exclusive affinity to Male or Female. This may be a lack of affinity to either [[self]] ([agender](https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Agender)), a total affinity to both ([bi-gender](https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Bigender)/), a balanced affinity to both (androgyne), an affinity that changes from day to day ([genderfluid](https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Genderfluid)), a partial affinity ([demigender](https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Demigender)), or even an affinity to the entire [[gender]] spectrum at once ([pangender](https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Pangender)).\n\nIt could be an affinity to some aspects of a [[gender]] but not others. For example, a [demigirl](https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Demigirl) could be someone assigned female at birth who only feels a partial connection to womanhood and femininity, or may be a male-assigned individual who is taking hormone therapy to relieve physical dysphoria, and has a female phenotype, but does not experience a strong connection to the social aspects of womanhood.\n\nIn generalist terms this book will be describing [[gender]] in a sense of binary identities (male/female) vs [[non-binary]] identities, but this is purely for the sake of writing simplicity. Please know that the depth of [[gender]] experience and expression is far, far more complicated than this simple breakdown.\n","created":"2021-05-10T18:22:56 (UTC -05:00)","tags":[],"source":"https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/what-is-gender","author":"Jocelyn Badgley","degree":13,"nameLength":16},"position":{"x":1151.3711276104336,"y":503.50065102527964},"group":"nodes","removed":false,"selected":true,"selectable":true,"locked":false,"grabbable":true,"pannable":false,"classes":"note filtered"},{"data":{"id":"core:self.md","name":"self","path":"30_Topics/self.md","content":"---\ncreated: 2021-07-21\ntags: node/topic/outline\naliases:\n- identity\n- self-concept\ndate modified: Monday, October 4th 2021, 9:58:06 pm\n---\n Human's own conception of their [[self]] is dependent on many things including their [[childhood]], [[socialization]], and their [[perception]] of the world.\n**Status**:: #EVER/GREEN\n*edited `=this.file.mtime`*\n\n**See**::\n*`$=customJS.dv_funcs.outlinedIn(dv, this)`*\n\n##### [[self]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.topicOutlineHeader(dv, this)`\n- [[Identity is your understanding of yourself vs your interaction with the world]]\n- There are two modes of viewing yourself, [[self-perception]] and [[self-image]]\n\t- [[self-perception]]\n\t- [[self-image]]\n- [[The triad of ever increasing social anxiety]]\n- [[self-actualization]]\n- [[self-love]]\n- [[self-hate]]\n- Impacted by\n\t- [[social anxiety]]\n- [[Is your self-talk bullying you or bodyguarding you]]\n- ![[enlightenment#enlightenment customJS dv_funcs topicOutlineHeader dv this]]\n### <hr class=\"dataviews\"/>\n\n`$=customJS.dv_funcs.topicNoteDataviews({dv, that:this})`\n","created":"2021-07-21","tags":"node/topic/outline","aliases":["identity","self-concept"],"date modified":"Monday, October 4th 2021, 9:58:06 pm","degree":35,"nameLength":4},"position":{"x":1015.7110546856175,"y":356.9247626412294},"group":"nodes","removed":false,"selected":true,"selectable":true,"locked":false,"grabbable":true,"pannable":false,"classes":"note tag-node tag-node-topic tag-node-topic-outline tag-EVER tag-EVER-GREEN hard-filtered global-0 global-1 filtered"},{"data":{"id":"core:mental health.md","name":"mental health","path":"30_Topics/mental health.md","content":"---\ncreated: 2021-05-29\nembedded: \n- [[anxiety]]\n- [[ADHD]]\n- [[trauma]]\n- [[my emotions]]\n- [[yoga]]\n- [[neurodivergency]]\n\ntags: node/topic/outline\n---\n\n[[mental health]] covers concepts that vary from [[mental disorders]] to [[neurodiversity]] to [[spirituality]] and how it effects us. \n\n**See**:: [[INDEX]], [[Neuroscience]]\n*`$=customJS.dv_funcs.outlinedIn(dv, this)`*\n\n\n##### [[mental health]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.topicOutlineHeader(dv, this)`\n\n- ![[anxiety#anxiety customJS dv_funcs topicOutlineHeader dv this]]\n- How [[neurodiversity]] affects mental health\n\t- ![[neurodiversity#neurodivergency customJS dv_funcs topicOutlineHeader dv this]]\n- ![[trauma#trauma customJS dv_funcs topicOutlineHeader dv this]]\n- [[mental disorders]]\n- Techniques to improve mental health\n\t- [[Tips for concentration]]\n\t- [[mindfullness]]\n\t- ![[yoga#yoga customJS dv_funcs topicOutlineHeader dv this]]\n- [[Sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion]]\n- ![[my emotions#my emotions customJS dv_funcs topicOutlineHeader dv this]]\n- ![[self#self customJS dv_funcs topicOutlineHeader dv this]]\n- ![[gender#gender customJS dv_funcs topicOutlineHeader dv this]]\n- ![[Neuroscience#Neuroscience customJS dv_funcs topicOutlineHeader dv this]]\n\n### <hr class=\"dataviews\"/>\n`$=customJS.dv_funcs.topicNoteDataviews({dv, that:this})`\n","created":"2021-05-29","embedded":[[["anxiety"]],[["ADHD"]],[["trauma"]],[["my emotions"]],[["yoga"]],[["neurodivergency"]]],"tags":"node/topic/outline","degree":11,"nameLength":13},"position":{"x":898.3279487919626,"y":338.749562481718},"group":"nodes","removed":false,"selected":true,"selectable":true,"locked":false,"grabbable":true,"pannable":false,"classes":"note tag-node tag-node-topic tag-node-topic-outline global-0 filtered"},{"data":{"id":"core:personality.md","name":"personality","path":"30_Topics/personality.md","content":"---\ncreated: 2021-10-18\ntags: node/topic/term\n---\n\n The combination of outward characteristics or qualities that form an individual's distinctive character.

Fundamentally this means that your [[perception]] of yourself is not accurate to what you want to be. The difficult part is that both your [[self-image]] and your [[self-perception]] can be out of step with what will actually make you happy. [[Bhuddism outlines a path and practice to end suffering, but does not promise it]]\n\n[[Self-image]] can be influenced by a longing for something that you have never achieved, and once you achieve it you may realize that you never wanted to be that thing. Perhaps this is because you were emulating people around you instead of who you really want to be. Or because you that that [[self-image]] would be an answer to an unrelated problem.\n\nThis is very common among [[transgender]] people because as their authentic [[self-image]] is rebuffed they fall back to stereotypical or examples for how they should present. This is why [[transgender|trans]]-masc people being hyper feminine while in the closet, and [[transgender|trans]]-fem people being hyper-masculine while in the closet is fairly common. They were never presenting as their true selves, so they fixated on the most extreme form of their \"correct\" [[gender]] presentation instead. [[Gender self-socialization model]]\n\nIf your [[self-image]] is correct, your [[self-perception]] may be off. You may have some form of [[body dysmorphia]] that prevents you from seeing your [[self]] accurately, or you may have outside forces that are influencing the way you perceive yourself. \n\n[[The difference between identity and presentation]] \n\n### <hr class=\"footnote\"/>\n\n**Status**:: #EVER/GREEN \n*edited `=this.file.mtime`*\n\n**Topics**:: [[mental health]], [[self-love]], [[self-hate]], [[trauma]], [[gender dysphoria]], [[body dysmorphia]]\n*`$=customJS.dv_funcs.outlinedIn(dv, this)`*\n\n\n","created":"2021-06-13","tags":"node/evergreen","sr-due":"2021-11-29","sr-interval":30,"sr-ease":272,"degree":13,"nameLength":76},"position":{"x":1138.5351004789918,"y":378.7455865150817},"group":"nodes","removed":false,"selected":true,"selectable":true,"locked":false,"grabbable":true,"pannable":false,"classes":"note tag-node tag-node-evergreen tag-EVER tag-EVER-GREEN global-1"},{"data":{"id":"core:Any experience of gender dysphoria is acceptable.md","name":"Any experience of gender dysphoria is acceptable","path":"40_Evergreens/Any experience of gender dysphoria is acceptable.md","content":"---\ncreated: 2021-08-08\ntags: node/evergreen\naliases:\n  - null\nsr-due: 2021-11-13\nsr-interval: 9\nsr-ease: 186\n---\n\n#### [[Any Experience of Gender Dysphoria is acceptable]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`\n\n[[Gender Dysphoria]] does not have to be a strong sense of being completely in the wrong body and completely the wrong [[gender]] with all the wrong body parts.

Subscribe [here](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/caseynewton/).*\n\nSay you run a large social network in which your most zealous users frequently discuss their [[Politics]]. In 2020, one way they are going to do this is through the sharing of memes --- pithy, punchy photos and videos designed for maximum partisan impact. Some of these memes will draw on actual facts; others will simply be insults. The most troublesome memes to deal with will be the ones that draw on real life but manipulate it in some way. These manipulations can be an essential part of satire, parody, and criticism. They can also trick people into believing a hoax. It's up to you to draw a bright line. Where do you draw it?\n\nThe question of manipulated [[media]] has come up in a big way twice in the past week. The first came when Twitter said it would label some manipulated and synthetic images starting next month. Here's [Adi Robertson in *[The Verge]{.ul}*](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/4/21122661/twitter-deepfake-manipulated-[[media]]-policy-rollout-date):\n\nTwitter will ban faked pictures, video, and other [[media]] that are \"deceptively shared\" and pose a serious safety risk. [The company just announced](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/new-approach-to-synthetic-and-manipulated-[[media]].html) a new policy on synthetic and manipulated [[media]] --- a category that encompasses sophisticated deepfake videos, but also low-tech deceptively edited content. In addition to banning egregious offenders, Twitter will label some tweets as \"manipulated [[media]]\" and link to a Twitter Moment that provides more context.\n\nThe second appearance of manipulated [[media]] in the headlines came after the State of the Union address, when President Trump shared on his Twitter account a video that purported to show House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tearing up his speech during a series of feel-good moments during the speech. Here's [Drew Harwell and Tony Romm in the *[Washington Post]{.ul}*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/02/07/trump-shared-an-edited-pelosi-video-social-[[media]]-highlighting-gray-area-debate-over-disinformation/):\n\nThe viral video shows President Trump delivering his State of the Union address, with a very notable alteration. As he commemorates \"Young [[Women]] Receiving Scholarships\" and \"Child Healthcare Successes,\" the video repeatedly cuts away to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ripping up her copy of the speech.\n\nIt didn't actually happen that way: Pelosi (D-Calif.) tore the pages only after Trump finished what she later called his \"manifesto of mistruths.\" But Trump on Thursday shared it anyway, sending it to millions of users on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/videos/vb.153080620724/173825713895904/?type=2&theater) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1225553117929988097) --- and sparking sharp criticism from Pelosi and her fellow Democrats, who labeled the video \"[doctored](https://twitter.com/RepDonBeyer/status/1225816845598547971)\" and \"[fake](https://twitter.com/RepEscobar/status/1225820699916427265),\" and demanded that the sites remove it. The companies refused.\n\nThis was, of course, the second time that a doctored video of Pelosi made national headlines, following the incident last May in which [a video of her appearing drunk went viral](https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/24/18637771/nancy-pelosi-[[congress]]-deepfake-video-facebook-twitter-youtube). (In reality, the video's creator had simply [slowed her speech to 75 percent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDOo5nDJwgA) of its original speed.)\n\nLying has [a long tradition in American politics](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YKOXIY/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1&tag=theverge02-20). So why have the Pelosi videos created a panic? One, they erode our shared sense of reality by throwing into question the legitimacy of video evidence, a technology that before now we have generally regarded as trustworthy. And two, they suggest that in the future we will be unable to reliably tell fact from fiction, particularly on matters of intense public debate. (I think there's also probably a third fear here: that huge numbers of people will be misled into voting for the \"wrong\" candidate because they fell for one or more hoaxes.)\n\nHence Pelosi's spokesman calling for the doctored State of the Union video to be removed from Facebook. Here's [Jeff Horwitz and Natalie Andrews in the *[Wall Street Journal]{.ul}*](https://www.wsj.com/articles/edited-video-of-pelosi-ripping-trumps-speech-renews-debate-over-manipulated-content-11581115051):\n\nDisagreements over the video triggered a spat on Twitter on Friday between Drew Hammill, Mrs. Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, and Andy Stone, a longtime Facebook spokesman. Mr. Hammill urged Facebook and Twitter to take down the video because it was \"deliberately designed to mislead and lie to the American people.\"\n\nTo that, Mr. Stone responded, \"Sorry, are you suggesting the President didn't make those remarks and the Speaker didn't rip the speech?\"\n\nEight minutes later, Mr. Hammill shot back: \"what planet are you living on? this is deceptively altered. take it down.\"\n\nThis is a perfect American debate over platforms in 2020, because it involves two people talking past one another without acknowledging any of the relevant tradeoffs, on a platform that rewards them for it with digital hearts.\n\nStill, in this case, I'm with Facebook and Twitter --- this video should not be removed from the [[internet]]. As Stone notes, Pelosi *did* rip up Trump's speech on camera --- and she did not appear to avoid tearing up the nice bits where Trump praised a soldier or handed out a scholarship. In fact, the whole point of tearing up the speech on camera was for the act to be widely viewed and discussed. It's odd to engineer a moment like this one, [[purpose]] built for social [[media]], and then try to get a meme of it taken down.\n\nPelosi's people argue that showing the clips out of order represents an unacceptable distortion. But the video clearly re-uses the clip of Pelosi tearing the speech multiple times, making the fact that it's a chop job [[self]]-evident. Viewed in that light, Hammill's complaint reads more like film criticism than a call for platform policy [[reform]].\n\nThe truth is that there's likely no way to draw a line requiring the Pelosi video to be taken down that would also permit the kind of political speech we see every day on television. Any criticism that doesn't reckon with that fact strikes me as fundamentally glib.\n\nOf course, it's also the case that political discourse on television --- particularly cable television --- is often terrible. A platform can embody high ideals of free speech and still be a pretty terrible place to become informed. It would be good for the country if, on that metric at least, Facebook and Twitter aimed much higher.\n\n# \n\n# 5 ways to spot disinformation on your social media feeds\n\n## ***Disinformation is everywhere.

They're both forms of actual \\\"fake news,\\\" a term that once meant fake stories but has been co-opted by some right-wing leaders and activists to describe [[media]] organizations that they don\\'t like.\n\nMuch disinformation (intentionally misleading) and misinformation (unintentionally misleading) is spread via social [[media]], so how do you spot these fake stories when they appear in your [Facebook](https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/facebook) feed, [Twitter](https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/twitter) timeline or [YouTube](https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/you-tube) playlist?\n\nRecently, there was a great example of a story involving Michael Bloomberg's presidential campaign, which spread like wildfire among journalists on Twitter. A mock video and a mock campaign logo surfaced online. Neither was meant to be taken seriously, but many journalists immediately shared them because they thought all their friends would find them funny. Before long the false narratives were seen by thousands.\n\n[MORE: [[Britain|UK]] election suggests disinformation spread by politicians may be a bigger threat in 2020 than [[Russia|Russians]] or 'deepfakes'](https://abcnews.go.com/International/uk-election-suggests-disinformation-spread-politicians-bigger-threat/story?id=67784381)\n\nThe best piece of advice to follow is to pause before you retweet or share, particularly if you have an emotional reaction and immediately think, \"Oh I must share this.\\\" If you'd like to take a deeper dive into best verification practices, [First Draft News,](https://firstdraftnews.org/) a non-profit that helps journalists and others navigate the increasingly complicated digital sphere, has an [hour-long class](https://firstdraftnews.org/en/education/course/verification-quick-start/1/) to help you become a debugging pro. Below, we have a quick guide for determining whether or not you are looking at a piece of mis/disinformation.\n\nRemember that the creators of disinformation purposely make content that is designed to trigger an emotional response, so if you find yourself having those reactions, please pause and consider the following questions.\n\n>  Is this the original account, article, or piece of content?\n>\n>  Who shared this or created it?\n>\n>  When was this created?\n>\n>  What account is sharing this? When was the account created? Do they share things from all over the world at all times during the day and night? Could this be a bot?\n>\n>  Why was this shared?\n\nIf you use these questions and do some simple digging before sharing, you too can help prevent disinformation fires on social [[media]], here's how:\n\n>  **[[Search]] online for the information or claim**. Sometimes, you'll be able to find fact-checkers online who have worked to debunk them. If the claim hasn't been reported widely by the press, there's a good chance this is because journalists couldn't confirm it.\n>\n>  **Look at who posted this content.** Inspect the poster\\'s profile, how long their account has been active, and post history to see if they demonstrate bot-like behavior. For example if an account posts at all hours of the day, from different parts of the world, and includes highly polarizing political content and content retweeted from other accounts, those posts were likely made by a machine.\n>\n>  **Check the profile picture of the account**. Do a reverse image [[SEARCH]] of the photo. If it's a stock image or an image of a celebrity, then that's a less reliable source because it's anonymous..\n>\n>  **[[Search]] for other social [[media]] accounts for this person**. See what you can find out about that person, do they have political or religious affiliations that might give them a reason for spreading a particular point of view?\n>\n>  **Inspect the content the account posted**. Does it look too good to be true? If it does then it usually isn't real. Try a reverse image [[SEARCH]]. Using a tool like RevEye you can [[SEARCH]] for any previous instances of any image that appears online. Much disinformation uses old images out of context to push a narrative. Using reverse image [[SEARCH]] you can find if the image is from a different story. If you know the location of the image or video use 'Street View' mapping services (Google, Bing and others provide the service) to see if what you're looking at matches what appears on the map. You can also reverse image [[SEARCH]] the profile picture to see if it or similar photos are being used on other accounts, a common practice used to create so-called \\\"sockpuppet\\\" accounts, fake personas created online that allow people to act as trolls while protecting their [[self]].\n\nThere are many more sophisticated fact-checking tools that are available online for free. Bellingcat, a non-profit that carries out online visual investigations outlines many of them [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BfLPJpRtyq4RFtHJoNpvWQjmGnyVkfE2HYoICKOGguA/edit)\n\nHowever, the truth is that the vast majority of disinformation can be dismissed without using any of this technology. In many cases, by just asking the question, \"Is this real?\" and taking a couple of minutes to investigate, you will be able to verify or debunk the story. The problem is that in a social [[media]] age, many of us instinctively hit that share button, before we even think to ask that question.\n\nWe saw how disinformation was used in the 2016 election, and more recently [in the U.K. election](https://abcnews.go.com/International/uk-election-suggests-disinformation-spread-politicians-bigger-threat/story?id=67784381), so it's likely to be used even more extensively in 2020.\n\nThe social [[media]] platforms have taken steps to stem the flow of disinformation but ultimately the only way to stop it spreading is for consumers to stop sharing it.\n\nSo maybe before you hit that share button, next time just stop and think, is this real?\n\n**The Billion-Dollar Disinformation Campaign to Reelect the President**\n\nHow new technologies and techniques pioneered by dictators will shape the 2020 election\n\n**[MARCH 2020 ISSUE](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/toc/2020/03/) \\--** <https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/03/the-2020-disinformation-war/605530/> [**POLITICS**](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/)\n\nBottom of Form\n\n*Updated at 2:30 p.m. ET on February 10, 2020.*\n\nO[ne day last fall]{.smallcaps}, I sat down to create a new Facebook account. I picked a forgettable name, snapped a profile pic with my face obscured, and clicked \"Like\" on the official pages of Donald Trump and his reelection campaign. Facebook's algorithm prodded me to follow Ann Coulter, Fox [[Business]], and a variety of fan pages with names like \"In Trump We Trust.\" I complied. I also gave my cellphone number to the Trump campaign, and joined a handful of private Facebook groups for MAGA diehards, one of which required an application that seemed designed to screen out interlopers.\n\n*To hear more feature stories, [[get the Audm iPhone app.]{.ul}](https://www.audm.com/?utm_source=soundcloud&utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=atlantic&utm_content=2020_disinformation_war)*\n\nThe president's reelection campaign was then in the midst of a multimillion-dollar ad blitz aimed at shaping [[America|Americans]]' understanding of the recently launched impeachment proceedings. Thousands of micro-targeted ads had flooded the [[internet]], portraying Trump as a heroic reformer cracking down on foreign corruption while Democrats plotted a coup. That this narrative bore little resemblance to reality seemed only to accelerate its spread. Right-wing websites amplified every claim. Pro-Trump forums teemed with conspiracy theories. An alternate information ecosystem was taking shape around the biggest news story in the country, and I wanted to see it from the inside.\n\nThe story that unfurled in my Facebook feed over the next several weeks was, at times, disorienting. There were days when I would watch, live on TV, an impeachment hearing filled with damning testimony about the president's conduct, only to look at my phone later and find a slickly edited video---served up by the Trump campaign---that used out-of-context clips to recast the same testimony as an exoneration. *Wait*, I caught myself wondering more than once, *is *that* what happened today?*\n\nAs I swiped at my phone, a stream of pro-Trump [[propaganda]] filled the screen: \"That's right, the whistleblower's own lawyer said, 'The coup has started ...' \" *Swipe*. \"Democrats are doing Putin's bidding ...\" *Swipe*. \"The only message these radical socialists and extremists will understand is a crushing ...\" *Swipe*. \"Only one man can stop this chaos ...\" *Swipe*,* swipe*,* swipe*.\n\nI was surprised by the effect it had on me. I'd assumed that my skepticism and [[media]] literacy would inoculate me against such distortions. But I soon found myself reflexively questioning *every* headline. It wasn't that I believed Trump and his boosters were telling the truth. It was that, in this state of heightened suspicion, truth itself---about Ukraine, impeachment, or anything else---felt more and more difficult to locate. With each swipe, the notion of observable reality drifted further out of reach.\n\nWhat I was seeing was a strategy that has been deployed by illiberal political leaders around the world. Rather than shutting down dissenting voices, these leaders have learned to harness the democratizing power of social [[media]] for their own purposes---jamming the signals, sowing confusion. They no longer need to silence the dissident shouting in the streets; they can use a megaphone to drown him out. Scholars have a name for this: censorship through noise.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, much was made of the threats posed to American democracy by foreign disinformation. Stories of Russian troll farms and Macedonian fake-news mills loomed in the national imagination. But while these shadowy outside forces preoccupied politicians and journalists, Trump and his domestic allies were beginning to adopt the same tactics of information warfare that have kept the world's demagogues and strongmen in power.\n\n[*[Read: What, exactly, were [[Russia|Russians]] trying to do with those Facebook ads?]{.ul}*](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/09/the-branching-possibilities-of-the-facebook-russian-ad-buy/541002/)\n\nEvery presidential campaign sees its share of spin and misdirection, but this year's contest promises to be different. In conversations with political strategists and other experts, a dystopian picture of the general election comes into view---one shaped by coordinated bot attacks, Potemkin local-news sites, micro-targeted fearmongering, and anonymous mass texting. Both parties will have these tools at their disposal. But in the hands of a president who lies constantly, who traffics in conspiracy theories, and who readily manipulates the levers of [[government]] for his own gain, their potential to wreak havoc is enormous.\n\nThe Trump campaign is planning to spend more than \\$1 billion, and it will be aided by a vast coalition of partisan [[media]], outside political groups, and enterprising freelance operatives. These pro-Trump forces are poised to wage what could be the most extensive disinformation campaign in U.S. history. Whether or not it succeeds in reelecting the president, the wreckage it leaves behind could be irreparable.\n\n**DISINFORMATION ARCHITECTURE**\n\nIn his book [*[This Is Not Propaganda]{.ul}*](https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/peter-pomerantsev/this-is-not-propaganda/9781541762138/), Peter Pomerantsev, a researcher at the London School of [[economy|Economics]], writes about a young Filipino political consultant he calls \"P.\" In college, P had studied the \"Little Albert experiment,\" in which scientists conditioned a young child to fear furry animals by exposing him to loud noises every time he encountered a white lab rat. The experiment gave P an idea. He created a series of Facebook groups for Filipinos to discuss what was going on in their communities. Once the groups got big enough---about 100,000 members---he began posting local crime stories, and instructed his employees to leave comments falsely tying the grisly headlines to drug cartels. The pages lit up with frightened chatter. Rumors swirled; conspiracy theories metastasized. To many, all crimes became drug crimes.\n\nUnbeknownst to their members, the Facebook groups were designed to boost Rodrigo Duterte, then a long-shot presidential candidate running on a pledge to brutally crack down on drug criminals. ([[Duterte once boasted]{.ul}](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/world/asia/rodrigo-duterte-philippines-killings.html) that, as mayor of Davao City, he rode through the streets on his motorcycle and personally executed drug dealers.) P's experiment was one plank in a larger \"disinformation architecture\"---which also included social-[[media]] influencers paid to mock opposing candidates, and mercenary trolls working out of former call centers---that experts say aided Duterte's rise to power. Since assuming office in 2016, Duterte has reportedly ramped up these efforts while presiding over thousands of extrajudicial killings.\n\nThe [[campaign in the Philippines]{.ul}](http://newtontechfordev.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Architects-of-Networked-Disinformation-Executive-Summary-Final.pdf) was emblematic of an emerging [[propaganda]] playbook, one that uses new tools for the age-old ends of autocracy. The [[Kremlin has long been an innovator in this area]{.ul}](https://time.com/5722805/rethink-information-[[war]]-russia/). (A 2011 manual for Russian civil servants favorably compared their methods of disinformation to \"an invisible radiation\" that takes effect while \"the population doesn't even feel it is being acted upon.\") But with the technological advances of the past decade, and the global proliferation of smartphones, governments around the world have found success deploying Kremlin-honed techniques against their own people.\n\n[*[Read: Peter Pomerantsev on [[Russia]] and the menace of unreality]{.ul}*](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/russia-putin-revolutionizing-information-warfare/379880/)\n\nIn [[America|the United States]], we tend to view such tools of oppression as the faraway problems of more fragile democracies. But the people working to reelect Trump understand the power of these tactics. They may use gentler terminology---*muddy the waters*;* alternative facts*---but they're building a machine designed to exploit their own sprawling disinformation architecture.\n\nCentral to that effort is the campaign's use of micro-targeting---the process of slicing up the electorate into distinct niches and then appealing to them with precisely tailored digital messages. The advantages of this approach are obvious: An ad that calls for defunding Planned Parenthood might get a mixed response from a large national audience, but serve it directly via Facebook to 800 Roman Catholic [[women]] in Dubuque, Iowa, and its reception will be much more positive. If candidates once had to shout their campaign promises from a soapbox, micro-targeting allows them to sidle up to millions of voters and whisper personalized messages in their ear.\n\nParscale didn't invent this practice---Barack Obama's campaign famously used it in 2012, and Clinton's followed suit. But Trump's effort in 2016 was unprecedented, in both its scale and its brazenness. In the final days of the 2016 race, for example, Trump's team tried to suppress turnout among black voters in Florida by slipping ads into their News Feeds that read, \"Hillary Thinks African-[[America|Americans]] Are Super Predators.\" An unnamed campaign official boasted to *Bloomberg Businessweek *that it was one of \"[[three major voter suppression operations underway]{.ul}](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-27/inside-the-trump-bunker-with-12-days-to-go).\" (The other two targeted young [[women]] and white liberals.)\n\nThe weaponization of micro-targeting was pioneered in large part by the data scientists at Cambridge Analytica. The firm began as part of a nonpartisan military contractor that used digital psyops to target terrorist groups and drug cartels. In Pakistan, it worked to thwart jihadist recruitment efforts; in South [[America]], it circulated disinformation to turn drug dealers against their bosses.\n\nThe emphasis shifted once the conservative billionaire Robert Mercer became a major investor and installed Steve Bannon as his point man. Using a massive trove of data it had gathered from Facebook and other sources---without users' consent---Cambridge Analytica worked [[to develop detailed \"psychographic profiles\"]{.ul}](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html) for every voter in the U.S., and began experimenting with ways to stoke paranoia and bigotry by exploiting certain personality traits. In one exercise, the firm asked white men whether they would approve of their daughter marrying a Mexican immigrant; those who said yes were asked a follow-up question designed to provoke irritation at the constraints of political correctness: \"Did you feel like you had to say that?\"\n\nChristopher Wylie, who was the director of research at Cambridge Analytica and later testified about the company to [[Congress]], told me that \"with the right kind of nudges,\" people who exhibited certain psychological characteristics could be pushed into ever more extreme beliefs and conspiratorial thinking. \"Rather than using data to interfere with the process of radicalization, Steve Bannon was able to invert that,\" Wylie said. \"We were essentially seeding an insurgency in [[America|the United States]].\"\n\nCambridge Analytica was dissolved in 2018, shortly after its CEO was caught on tape bragging about using bribery and sexual \"honey traps\" on behalf of clients. (The firm denied that it actually used such tactics.) Since then, some political scientists have questioned how much effect its \"psychographic\" targeting really had. But Wylie---who spoke with me from London, where he now works for H&M, as a fashion-trend forecaster---said the firm's work in 2016 was a modest test run compared with what could come.\n\n\"What happens if North Korea or Iran picks up where Cambridge Analytica left off?\" he said, noting that plenty of foreign actors will be looking for ways to interfere in this year's election. \"There are countless hostile states that have more than enough capacity to quickly replicate what we were able to do ... and make it much more sophisticated.\" These efforts may not come only from abroad: A group of former Cambridge Analytica employees have formed a new firm that, [[according to the Associated Press]{.ul}](https://apnews.com/96928216bdc341ada659447973a688e4), is working with the Trump campaign. (The firm has denied this, and a campaign spokesperson declined to comment.)\n\nAfter the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke, [[Facebook was excoriated for its mishandling of user data]{.ul}](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news) and complicity in the viral spread of fake news. Mark Zuckerberg promised to do better, and rolled out a flurry of reforms. But then, last fall, he handed a major victory to lying politicians: Candidates, he said, would be allowed to continue running false ads on Facebook. (Commercial advertisers, by contrast, are subject to fact-checking.) In [[a speech at Georgetown University]{.ul}](https://www.facebook.com/zuck/videos/10109815371842941/?notif_id=1571332000346664&notif_t=live_video), the CEO argued that his company [[shouldn't be responsible for arbitrating political speech]{.ul}](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/business/zuckerberg-facebook-free-speech.html), and that because political ads already receive so much scrutiny, candidates who choose to lie will be held accountable by journalists and watchdogs.\n\nShady political actors are discovering how easy it is to wage an untraceable whisper campaign by text message.\n\nTo bolster his case, Zuckerberg pointed to the recently launched---and publicly accessible---[[\"library\" where Facebook archives every political ad it publishes]{.ul}](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/). The project has a certain [[democratic]] appeal: Why censor false or toxic content when a little sunlight can have the same effect? But spend some time scrolling through the archive of Trump reelection ads, and you quickly see the limits of this transparency.\n\n[*[Read: The age of reverse censorship]{.ul}*](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/06/is-the-first-amendment-obsolete/563762/)\n\nThe campaign doesn't run just one ad at a time on a given theme. It runs hundreds of iterations---adjusting the language, the music, even the colors of the \"Donate\" buttons. In the 10 weeks after the House of Representatives began its impeachment inquiry, the Trump campaign ran roughly 14,000 different ads containing the word *impeachment*. Sifting through all of them is virtually impossible.\n\nBoth parties will rely on micro-targeted ads this year, but the president is likely to have a distinct advantage. The Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign have reportedly compiled an average of [[3,000 data points on every voter in America]{.ul}](https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2019/1217/Watch-golf-Own-guns-Trump-data-team-has-ads-just-for-you). They have spent years experimenting with ways to tweak their messages based not just on [[gender]] and geography, but on whether the recipient owns a gun or watches the Golf Channel.\n\nWhile these ads can be used to try to win over undecided voters, they're most often deployed for fundraising and for firing up the faithful---and Trump's advisers believe this election will be decided by mobilization, not persuasion. To turn out the base, the campaign has signaled that it will return to familiar themes: the threat of \"illegal aliens\"---[[a term Parscale has reportedly encouraged Trump to use]{.ul}](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-brad-parscale-once-a-nobody-in-san-antonio-shaped-trumps-combative-[[politics]]-and-rose-to-his-inner-circle/2018/11/09/b4257d58-dbb7-11e8-b3f0-62607289efee_story.html)---and the corruption of the \"swamp.\"\n\nBeyond Facebook, the campaign is also investing in a texting platform that could allow it to send anonymous messages directly to millions of voters' phones without their permission. Until recently, people had to opt in before a campaign could include them in a mass text. But with new \"peer to peer\" texting apps---including one developed by Gary Coby, a senior Trump adviser---[[a single volunteer can send hundreds of messages an hour]{.ul}](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vbjjw9/text-campaigns-are-changing-american-[[politics]]-and-nobodys-ready), skirting federal regulations by clicking \"Send\" one message at a time. Notably, these messages aren't required to disclose who's behind them, thanks to a 2002 ruling by the Federal Election Commission that cited the limited number of characters available in a text.\n\nMost experts assume that these regulations will be overhauled sometime after the 2020 election. For now, campaigns from both parties are hoovering up as many cellphone numbers as possible, and Parscale has said texting will be at the center of Trump's reelection strategy. The medium's ability to reach voters is unparalleled: While robocalls get sent to voicemail and email blasts get trapped in spam folders, peer-to-peer texting companies say that at least 90 percent of their messages are opened.\n\nThe Trump campaign's texts so far this cycle have focused on shouty fundraising pleas (\"They have NOTHING! IMPEACHMENT IS OVER! Now let's CRUSH our End of Month Goal\"). But the potential for misuse by outside groups is clear---and shady political actors are already discovering how easy it is to wage an untraceable whisper campaign by text.\n\nIn 2018, as early voting got under way in Tennessee's Republican gubernatorial primary, [[voters began receiving text messages]{.ul}](https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/tn-elections/2018/07/13/tn-governors-race-tennesseans-receive-potentially-illegal-text-messages-attacking-randy-boyd-billlee/783785002/) attacking two of the candidates' conservative credentials. The texts---written in a conversational style, as if they'd been sent from a friend---were unsigned, and people who tried calling the numbers received a busy signal. The local press covered the smear campaign. Law enforcement was notified. But the source of the texts was never discovered.\n\n**WAR ON THE PRESS**\n\nOne afternoon last March, I was on the phone with a [[Republican]] operative close to the Trump family when he casually mentioned that a reporter at *[[Business]] Insider *was about to have a very bad day. The journalist, John Haltiwanger, had tweeted something that annoyed Donald Trump Jr., prompting the coterie of friends and allies surrounding the president's son to drum up a hit piece. The story they had coming, the operative suggested to me, would demolish the reporter's credibility.\n\nI wasn't sure what to make of this gloating---people in Trump's circle have a tendency toward bluster. But a few hours later, the operative sent me a link to a *Breitbart News* article documenting Haltiwanger's \"history of intense Trump hatred.\" The story was based on a series of Instagram posts---all of them from before Haltiwanger started working at *[[Business]] Insider*---in which he made fun of the president and expressed solidarity with liberal protesters.\n\nThe next morning, Don Jr. [[tweeted the story]{.ul}](https://twitter.com/donaldjtrumpjr/status/1108705539951939584?lang=en) to his 3 million followers, denouncing Haltiwanger as a \"raging lib.\" Other conservatives piled on, and the reporter was bombarded with abusive messages and calls for him to be fired. His employer issued a statement conceding that the Instagram posts were \"not appropriate.\" Haltiwanger kept his job, but the experience, he told me later, \"was bizarre and unsettling.\"\n\nThe *Breitbart* story was part of a coordinated effort by a coalition of Trump allies to air embarrassing information about reporters who produce critical coverage of the president. (*The New York Times* [[first reported on this project]{.ul}](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/25/us/politics/trump-allies-news-[[media]].html) last summer; since then, it's been described to me in greater detail.) According to people with knowledge of the effort, pro-Trump operatives have scraped social-[[media]] accounts belonging to hundreds of political journalists and compiled years' worth of posts into a dossier.\n\nOften when a particular news story is deemed especially unfair---or politically damaging---to the president, Don Jr. will flag it in a text thread that he uses for this [[purpose]]. (Among those who text regularly with the president's eldest son, someone close to him told me, are the conservative activist Charlie Kirk; two GOP strategists, Sergio Gor and Arthur Schwartz; Matthew Boyle, a *Breitbart* editor; and U.S. Ambassador Richard Grenell.) Once a story has been marked for attack, someone searches the dossier for material on the journalists involved. If something useful turns up---a problematic old joke; evidence of liberal political views---Boyle turns it into a *Breitbart* headline, which White House officials and campaign surrogates can then share on social [[media]]. (The White House has denied any involvement in this effort.)\n\nDescriptions of the dossier vary. One source I spoke with said that a programmer in India had been paid to organize it into a searchable database, making posts that contain offensive keywords easier to find. Another told me the dossier had expanded to at least 2,000 people, including not just journalists but high-profile academics, politicians, celebrities, and other potential Trump foes. Some of this, of course, may be hyperbolic boasting---but the effort has yielded fruit.\n\nParscale has said the campaign intends to train \"swarms of surrogates\" to undermine coverage from local TV stations and newspapers.\n\nIn the past year, the operatives involved have gone after journalists at CNN, *The* *Washington Post*, and *The* *New York Times*. They exposed one reporter for [[using the word *fag* in college]{.ul}](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2018/10/08/cnn-reporter-kaitlan-collins-under-fire-for-seven-year-old-homophobic-tweets/), and another for [[posting anti-Semitic and racist jokes a decade ago]{.ul}](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/crappy-jew-year-new-york-times-editor-apologizes-for-offensive-tweets). These may not have been career-ending revelations, but people close to the project said they're planning to unleash much more opposition research as the campaign intensifies. \"This is innovative shit,\" said Mike Cernovich, a right-wing activist with a history of trolling. \"They're appropriating call-out culture.\"\n\nWhat's notable about this effort is not that it aims to expose [[media]] bias. Conservatives have been complaining---with some merit---about a liberal slant in the press for decades. But in the Trump era, an important shift has taken place. Instead of trying to [[reform]] the press, or critique its coverage, today's most influential conservatives [[want to destroy the mainstream [[media]] altogether]{.ul}](https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2017/07/19/breitbarts-boyle-goal-elimination-entire-mainstream-media/). \"Journalistic integrity is dead,\" Boyle declared in a 2017 speech at the Heritage Foundation. \"There is no such thing anymore. So everything is about weaponization of information.\"\n\nIt's a lesson drawn from demagogues around the world: When the press as an institution is weakened, fact-based journalism becomes just one more drop in the daily deluge of content---no more or less credible than partisan [[propaganda]]. Relativism is the real goal of Trump's assault on the press, and the more \"enemies of the people\" his allies can take out along the way, the better. \"[[A culture [[war]] is a war]{.ul}](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/25/us/politics/trump-allies-news-[[media]].html),\" Steve Bannon told the *Times* last year. \"There are casualties in [[war]].\"\n\nThis attitude has permeated the president's base. At rallies, people wear T-shirts that read [rope. tree. journalist. some assembly required.]{.smallcaps} A *CBS News*/YouGov poll has found that [[just 11 percent of strong Trump supporters trust the mainstream media]{.ul}](https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a22600827/donald-trump-supporters-believe-the-media/)---while 91 percent turn to the president for \"accurate information.\" This dynamic makes it all but impossible for the press to hold the president accountable, something Trump himself seems to understand. \"Remember,\" he told a crowd in 2018, \"[[what you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening]{.ul}](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-44959340/donald-trump-what-you-re-seeing-and-what-you-re-reading-is-not-what-s-happening).\"\n\nBryan Lanza, who worked for the Trump campaign in 2016 and remains a White House surrogate, told me flatly that he sees no possibility of [[America|Americans]] establishing a common set of facts from which to conduct the big debates of this year's election. Nor is that his goal. \"It's our job to sell our narrative louder than the [[media]],\" Lanza said. \"They're clearly advocating for a liberal-socialist position, and we're never going to be in concert. So the [[war]] continues.\"\n\n[*[From December 2019: The dark psychology of social networks]{.ul}*](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/12/social-[[media]]-democracy/600763/)\n\nParscale has indicated that he plans to open up a new front in this [[war]]: local news. Last year, he said the campaign [[intends to train \"swarms of surrogates\"]{.ul}](https://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/20190531/brad-parscale-genius-who-won-trumps-campaign-and-how-hell-get-him-reelected) to undermine negative coverage from local TV stations and newspapers. Polls have long found that [[America|Americans]] across the political spectrum trust local news more than national [[media]]. If the campaign has its way, that trust will be eroded by November. \"We can actually build up and fight with the local newspapers,\" Parscale told donors, according to a recording provided by *The* *Palm Beach Post*. \"So we're not just fighting on Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC with the same 700,000 people watching every day.\"\n\nRunning parallel to this effort, some conservatives have been experimenting with [[a scheme to exploit the credibility of local journalism]{.ul}](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/upshot/fake-local-news.html). Over the past few years, hundreds of websites with innocuous-sounding names like *the Arizona Monitor* and *The Kalamazoo Times *have begun popping up. [[At first glance, they look like regular publications, complete with community notices and coverage of schools]{.ul}](https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/hundreds-of-pink-slime-local-news-outlets-are-distributing-algorithmic-stories-conservative-talking-points.php). But look closer and you'll find that there are often no mastheads, few if any bylines, and no addresses for local offices. Many of them are organs of [[Republican]] lobbying groups; others belong to a mysterious company called Locality Labs, which is run by a conservative activist in Illinois. Readers are given no indication that these sites have political agendas---which is precisely what makes them valuable.\n\nAccording to one longtime strategist, candidates looking to plant a negative story about an opponent can pay to have their desired headlines posted on some of these Potemkin news sites. By working through a third-party consulting firm---instead of paying the sites directly---candidates are able to obscure their involvement in the scheme when they file expenditures to the Federal Election Commission. Even if the stories don't fool savvy readers, the headlines are convincing enough to be flashed across the screen in a campaign commercial or slipped into fundraising emails.\n\n**DIGITAL DIRTY TRICKS**\n\nShortly after polls closed in Kentucky's gubernatorial election last November, an anonymous Twitter user named \\@Overlordkraken1 announced to his 19 followers that he had \"just shredded a box of [[Republican]] mail in ballots\" in Louisville.\n\nThere was little reason to take this claim at face value, and plenty of reason to doubt it (beginning with the fact that he'd misspelled *Louisville*). But the race was tight, and as incumbent Governor Matt Bevin began to fall behind in the vote total, [[an army of Twitter bots began spreading the election-rigging claim]{.ul}](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/10/us/politics/kentucky-election-disinformation-twitter.html).\n\nThe original post was removed by Twitter, but by then thousands of automated accounts were circulating screenshots of it with the hashtag \\#StoptheSteal. Popular right-wing internet personalities jumped on the narrative, and soon the Bevin campaign was making noise about unspecified voting \"irregularities.\" When the race was called for his opponent, the governor refused to concede, and asked for a statewide review of the vote. (No evidence of ballot-shredding was found, and he finally [[admitted defeat nine days later]{.ul}](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/14/politics/kentucky-governor-recanvas-begins/index.html).)\n\nThe Election Night disinformation blitz had all the markings of a foreign influence operation. In 2016, Russian trolls had worked in similar ways to contaminate U.S. political discourse---[[posing as Black Lives Matter activists]{.ul}](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/17/russia-social-media-senate-report/2334382002/) in an attempt to inflame racial divisions, and fanning pro-Trump conspiracy theories. (They even used Facebook to organize rallies, including one for Muslim supporters of Clinton in Washington, D.C., where they [[got someone to hold up a sign]{.ul}](https://www.businessinsider.com/russians-organized-pro-anti-trump-rallies-to-sow-discord-2018-2#july-9-2016-washington-dc-2) attributing a fictional quote to the candidate: \"I think Sharia law will be a powerful new direction of freedom.\")\n\nBut when Twitter employees later reviewed the activity surrounding Kentucky's election, they concluded that the [[bots were largely based in America]{.ul}](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/10/us/politics/kentucky-election-disinformation-twitter.html)---a sign that political operatives here were learning to mimic Russian trolling tactics.\n\nOf course, dirty tricks aren't new to American [[Politics]]. From Lee Atwater and Roger Stone to the crooked machine Democrats of Chicago, the country has a long history of underhanded operatives smearing opponents and meddling in elections. And, in fact, Samuel Woolley, [[a scholar who studies digital propaganda]{.ul}](https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/samuel-woolley/the-reality-game/9781541768253/), told me that the first documented deployment of politicized Twitter bots was in the U.S. In 2010, an Iowa-based conservative group set up a small network of automated accounts with names like \\@BrianD82 to promote the idea that Martha Coakley, a [[Democrat]] running for Senate in Massachusetts, was anti-Catholic.\n\nSince then, the tactics of Twitter warfare have grown more sophisticated, as regimes around the world experiment with new ways to deploy their cybermilitias. In [[Mexico]], supporters of then-President Enrique Peña Nieto created \"sock puppet\" accounts to pose as protesters and sabotage the opposition movement. In Azerbaijan, a pro-[[government]] youth group waged coordinated harassment campaigns against journalists, flooding their Twitter feeds with graphic threats and insults. When these techniques prove successful, Woolley told me, [[America|Americans]] improve upon them. \"It's almost as if there's a Columbian exchange between developing-world authoritarian regimes and the West,\" he said.\n\nParscale has denied that the campaign uses bots, [[saying in a *60 Minutes *interview]{.ul}](https://www.cbs.com/shows/60_minutes/video/elHhrLFmOS2ZYFqRG68KQPAu0_aUKPKC/who-is-brad-parscale-/), \"I don't think \\[they\\] work.\" He may be right---it's unlikely that these nebulous networks of trolls and bots could swing a national election. But they do have their uses. They can simulate false consensus, derail sincere debate, and hound people out of the public square.\n\nAccording to one study, [[bots accounted for roughly 20 percent]{.ul}](https://firstmonday.org/article/view/7090/5653) of all the tweets posted about the 2016 election during one five-week period that year. And Twitter is already infested with bots that seem designed to boost Trump's reelection prospects. Regardless of where they're coming from, they have tremendous potential to divide, radicalize, and stoke hatred that lasts long after the votes are cast.\n\nRob Flaherty, who served as the digital director for Beto O'Rourke's presidential campaign, told me that Twitter in 2020 is a \"hall of mirrors.\" He said one mysterious account started [[a viral rumor]{.ul}](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/orourke-campaign-responds-to-bot-promoted-conspiracy-theory-that-odessa-shooter-was-a-supporter/) that the gunman who killed seven people in Odessa, Texas, last summer had a [beto]{.smallcaps} bumper sticker on his car. Another masqueraded as an O'Rourke supporter and hurled racist invective at a journalist. Some of these tactics echoed 2016, when [[Russian agitators posed as [[Bernie Sanders]] supporters]{.ul}](https://www.salon.com/2019/04/12/new-data-suggests-[[Russia|russians]]-targeted-bernie-sanders-voters-to-help-elect-trump/) and stirred up anger toward Hillary Clinton.\n\nFlaherty said he didn't know who was behind the efforts targeting O'Rourke, and the candidate dropped out before they could make a real difference. \"But you can't watch this landscape and not get the feeling that someone's fucking with something,\" he told me. Flaherty has since joined Joe Biden's campaign, which has had to contend with similar distortions: Last year, a website resembling an official Biden campaign page appeared on the internet. It emphasized elements of the candidate's legislative record likely to hurt him in the Democratic primary---opposition to same-sex marriage, support for the Iraq War---and featured video clips of his awkward encounters with women. The site quickly became one of the most-visited Biden-related sites on the web. [[It was designed by a Trump consultant]{.ul}](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/29/us/politics/fake-joe-biden-website.html).\n\n**FIGHTING FIRE WITH FIRE**\n\nAs the president's reelection machine ramps up, [[Democratic]] strategists have found themselves debating an urgent question: Can they defeat the Trump coalition without adopting its tactics?\n\nOn one side of this argument is Dmitri Mehlhorn, a consultant notorious for his willingness to experiment with digital subterfuge. During Alabama's special election in 2017, Mehlhorn helped fund at least two \"false flag\" operations against the [[Republican]] Senate candidate, Roy Moore. For one scheme, [[faux Russian Twitter bots followed the candidate's account]{.ul}](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/us/alabama-senate-roy-jones-[[russia]].html) to make it look like the Kremlin was backing Moore. For another, a fake social-[[media]] campaign, dubbed \"Dry Alabama,\" was designed to link Moore to fictional Baptist teetotalers trying to ban alcohol. (Mehlhorn has claimed that he unaware of the Russian bot effort** **and does not support the use of misinformation.)\n\nWhen *The* *New York Times* [[uncovered the second plot, one of the activists involved, Matt Osborne, contended]{.ul}](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/us/politics/alabama-senate-facebook-roy-moore.html) that Democrats had no choice but to employ such unscrupulous techniques. \"If you don't do it, you're fighting with one hand tied behind your back,\" Osborne said. \"You have a moral imperative to do this---to do whatever it takes.\"\n\nOthers have argued that this is precisely the wrong moment for Democrats to start abandoning ideals of honesty and [[fairness]]. \"It's just not in my values to go out there making shit up and tricking voters,\" Flaherty told me. \"I know there's this whole fight-fire-with-fire contingent, but generally when you ask them what they mean, they're like, 'Lie!' \" Some also note that the president has already handed them plenty of ammunition. \"I don't think the [[Democratic]] campaign is going to need to make stuff up about Trump,\" Judd Legum, the author of a progressive newsletter about digital [[Politics]], told me. \"They can stick to things that are true.\"\n\nEventually, the fear of covert [[propaganda]] inflicts as much damage as the [[propaganda]] itself.\n\nOne [[Democrat]] straddling these two camps is a young, tech-savvy strategist named Tara McGowan. Last fall, she and the former [[Obama]] adviser David Plouffe launched a political-action committee with a pledge to spend \\$75 million attacking Trump online. At the time, the president's campaign was running more ads on Facebook and Google than the top four [[Democratic]] candidates combined. McGowan's plans to return fire included such ads, but she also had more creative---and controversial---measures in mind.\n\nFor example, [[she established a [[media]] organization with a staff of writers]{.ul}](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-11-25/acronym-s-newsrooms-are-a-liberal-digital-spin-on-local-news) to produce left-leaning \"hometown news\" stories that can be micro-targeted to persuadable voters on Facebook without any indication that they're paid for by a political group. Though she insists that the reporting is strictly factual, some see the enterprise as a too-close-for-comfort co-opting of right-wing tactics.\n\nWhen I spoke with McGowan, she was open about her willingness to push boundaries that might make some Democrats queasy. As far as she was concerned, the \"super-predator\" ads Trump ran to depress black turnout in 2016 were \"fair game\" because they had some basis in fact. (Clinton did use the term in 1996, to refer to gang members.) McGowan suggested that a similar approach could be taken with conservatives. [[She ruled out attempts to misinform Republicans about when and where to vote]{.ul}](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/09/facebook-silicon-valley-[[democratic]]-party.html)---a tactic Mehlhorn reportedly considered, though he later said he was joking---but said she would pursue any strategy that was \"in the bounds of the law.\"\n\n\"We are in a radically disruptive moment right now,\" McGowan told me. \"We have a president that lies every day, unabashedly ... I think Trump is so desperate to win this election that he will do anything. There will be no bar too low for him.\"\n\nThis intraparty split was highlighted last year when state officials urged the [[Democratic]] National Committee to formally disavow the use of bots, troll farms, and \"deepfakes\" (digitally manipulated videos that can, with alarming precision, make a person appear to do or say anything). Supporters saw the proposed pledge as a way of contrasting their party's values with those of the GOP. But after months of lobbying, the committee refused to adopt the pledge.\n\n[*[From May 2018: The era of fake video begins]{.ul}*](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/05/realitys-end/556877/)\n\nMeanwhile, experts worried about domestic disinformation are looking to other countries for lessons. The most successful recent example may be Indonesia, which cracked down on the problem after a wave of viral lies and conspiracy theories pushed by hard-line Islamists led to the defeat of a popular [[Christianity|Christian]] Chinese candidate for governor in 2016. To prevent a similar disruption in last year's presidential election, a coalition of journalists from more than two dozen top Indonesian news outlets worked together to identify and debunk hoaxes before they gained traction online. But while that may sound like a promising model, it was paired with aggressive efforts by the state to monitor and arrest purveyors of fake news---an approach that would run afoul of the First Amendment if attempted in the U.S.\n\nRichard Stengel, who served as the undersecretary of state for public diplomacy under President [[Obama]], spent almost three years trying to counter digital [[propaganda]] from the Islamic State and [[Russia]]. By the time he left office, he told me, he was convinced that disinformation would continue to thrive until big tech companies were forced to take responsibility for it. Stengel has proposed amending the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which shields online platforms from liability for messages posted by third parties. Companies such as Facebook and Twitter, he believes, should be required by law to police their platforms for disinformation and abusive trolling. \"It's not going to solve the whole problem,\" he told me, \"but it's going to help with volume.\"\n\nThere is one other case study to consider. During the Ukrainian [[revolution]] in 2014, pro-democracy activists found that they could defang much of the false information about their movement by repeatedly exposing its Russian origins. But this kind of transparency comes with a cost, Stengel observed. Over time, alertness to the prevalence of [[propaganda]] can curdle into paranoia. Russian operatives have been known to encourage such [[anxiety]] by spreading rumors that exaggerate their own influence. Eventually, the fear of covert [[propaganda]] inflicts as much damage as the [[propaganda]] itself.\n\nOnce you internalize the possibility that you're being manipulated by some hidden hand, nothing can be trusted. Every dissenting voice on Twitter becomes a Russian bot, every uncomfortable headline a false flag, every political development part of an ever-deepening conspiracy. By the time the information ecosystem collapses under the weight of all this cynicism, you're too vigilant to notice that the disinformationists have won.\n\n...The political theorist Hannah Arendt once wrote that the most successful totalitarian leaders of the 20th century instilled in their followers \"a mixture of gullibility and cynicism.\" When they were lied to, they chose to believe it. When a lie was debunked, they claimed they'd known all along---and would then \"admire the leaders for their superior tactical cleverness.\" Over time, Arendt wrote, the onslaught of [[propaganda]] conditioned people to \"believe everything and nothing, think that everything was possible and that nothing was true.\" ...Should this ethos prevail in 2020, the election's legacy will be clear---not a choice between parties or candidates or policy platforms, but a referendum on reality itself.\n\n*This article appears in the March 2020 print edition with the headline \"The 2020 Disinformation [[War]].\"*\n\n[**MCKAY COPPINS**](https://www.theatlantic.com/author/mckay-coppins/)* is a staff writer at *The Atlantic* and the author of *[[The Wilderness]{.ul}](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0316327417/theatla05-20/)*, a book about the battle over the future of the [[Republican]] Party.*\n","degree":2,"nameLength":47},"position":{"x":830.9231662749786,"y":513.6188937306473},"group":"nodes","removed":false,"selected":true,"selectable":true,"locked":false,"grabbable":true,"pannable":false,"classes":"note filtered"},{"data":{"id":"core:5 Social Mobility.md","name":"5 Social Mobility","path":"00_Meta/Primary Sources/Classes/History/5 Social Mobility.md","content":"*Which neighborhoods in [[America]] offer children the best chance to rise out of [[poverty]]?*\n\nThe Opportunity Atlas answers this question using anonymous data following 20 million [[America|Americans]] from childhood to their mid-30s.

A new study by Alberto Alesina, Stefanie Stantcheva and Edoardo Teso of Harvard University compares perceptions of social mobility in five countries---[[America]], [[Britain]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and Sweden---against actual levels. It finds that [[America|Americans]] tend to be optimistic, while Europeans tend to be too pessimistic. An American born to a household in the bottom 20% of earnings, for instance, only has a 7.8% chance of reaching the top 20% when they grow up. [[America|Americans]] surveyed thought the probability was 11.7%.\n\nPolitically left-leaning respondents are naturally more doubtful about the scale of social mobility, and are more likely to support redistributive [[government]] policies, than conservative ones. But Mr Alesina and his colleagues also find that people of different political stripes also respond differently to new information. When given pessimistic information about social mobility, left-wing respondents became even more likely to support economic redistribution. In contrast, right-wing respondents' support for redistribution did not change. Perhaps, the authors suggest, right-leaning respondents see [[government]] as \"the cause of the problem, not the solution\".\n\n# \n\nJan 25, 2020\n\n# The American Dream --- in crisis\n\nBy [Erica Pandey](https://www.axios.com/authors/epandey) \\-- Jan 25, 2020\n\n**The big picture:** Socioeconomic mobility in the U.S. is at its most sluggish in history.

Rich [[parents]] can afford to spend more time and money on their kids, and that gap has only grown the past few decades. Indeed, economists [Greg Duncan and Richard Murnane](https://www.russellsage.org/publications/whither-opportunity) calculate that, between 1972 and 2006, high-income [[parents]] increased their spending on \\\"enrichment activities\\\" for their children by 151 percent in inflation-adjusted terms, compared to 57 percent for low-income [[parents]].\n\nBut, of course, it\\'s not just a matter of dollars and cents. It\\'s also a matter of letters and words. Affluent [[parents]] talk to their kids [three more hours a week](http://www.democracyjournal.org/30/the-parenting-gap.php?page=all) on average than poor [[parents]], which is critical during a child\\'s formative early years. That\\'s why, as Stanford professor [Sean Reardon](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/27/no-rich-child-left-behind/) explains, \\\"rich students are increasingly entering kindergarten much better prepared to succeed in school than middle-class students,\\\" and they\\'re staying that way.\n\nIt\\'s an educational arms race that\\'s leaving many kids far, far behind. It\\'s depressing, but not nearly so much as this:\n\nEven poor kids who do everything right don\\'t do much better than rich kids who do everything wrong. Advantages and disadvantages, in other words, tend to perpetuate themselves. You can see that in the above chart, based on a new paper from [Richard Reeves and Isabel Sawhill](http://www.bostonfed.org/inequality2014/papers/reeves-sawhill.pdf), presented at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\\'s annual conference.\n\nSpecifically, rich high school dropouts remain in the top about as much as poor college grads stay stuck in the bottom --- 14 versus 16 percent, respectively. Not only that, but these low-income strivers are just as likely to end up in the bottom as these wealthy ne\\'er-do-wells. Some meritocracy.\n\nWhat\\'s going on? Well, it\\'s all about glass floors and glass ceilings. Rich kids who can go work for the family [[business]], for example, or inherit the family estate. They don\\'t need a high school diploma to get ahead. It\\'s an extreme example of what economists call \\\"[opportunity hoarding](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/the-glass-floor-problem/).\\\" That includes everything from legacy college admissions to unpaid internships that let affluent [[parents]] rig the game a little more in their children\\'s favor.\n\nBut even if they didn\\'t, low-income kids would still have a hard time getting ahead. That\\'s, in part, because they\\'re targets for diploma mills that load them up with [[debt]], but not a lot of prospects. And even if they do get a good degree, at least when it comes to black families, they\\'re more likely to [still live in impoverished neighborhoods](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/desean_jackson_richard_sherman_and_black_american_economic_mobility_why.html) that keep them disconnected from opportunities.\n\nIt\\'s not quite a heads-I-win, tails-you-lose game where rich kids get better educations, yet still get ahead even if they don\\'t---but it\\'s close enough. And if it keeps up, the American Dream will be just that.\n\nRelated links: [One in four [[America|Americans]] think poor people don\\'t work hard enough](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/10/09/one-in-four-[[America|americans]]-think-poor-people-dont-work-hard-enough/) [What your 1st-grade life says about the rest of it](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/08/29/what-your-1st-grade-life-says-about-the-rest-of-it/)\n\n# \n\n# ![](media/image3.png){width=\"1.6694444444444445in\" height=\"1.1680555555555556in\"}A Lesson About Privilege\n\n**With a recycling bin and some scrap paper.**posted on Nov. 21, 2014, at 1:30 p.m.\n\n[Nathan W.

By Robert Putnam. *Simon & Schuster; 386 pages; \\$28 and £18.99.*\n\nTHE most important divide in [[America]] today is class, not race, and the place where it matters most is in the home. Conservatives have been banging on about family breakdown for decades. Now one of the nation's most prominent liberal scholars has joined the chorus.\n\nRobert Putnam is a former dean of Harvard's Kennedy School of [[government]] and the author of \"Bowling Alone\" (2000), an influential work that lamented the decline of social capital in [[America]]. In his new book, \"Our Kids\", he describes the growing gulf between how the rich and the poor raise their children. Anyone who has read \"Coming Apart\" by Charles Murray will be familiar with the trend, but Mr Putnam adds striking detail and some excellent graphs (pictured). This is a thoughtful and persuasive book.\n\nAmong the educated elite the traditional family is thriving: fewer than 10% of births to female college graduates are outside marriage---a figure that is barely higher than it was in 1970. In 2007 among [[women]] with just a high-school [[education]], by contrast, 65% of births were non-marital. Race makes a difference: only 2% of births to white college graduates are out-of-wedlock, compared with 80% among African-[[America|Americans]] with no more than a high-school [[education]], but neither of these figures has changed much since the 1970s. However, the non-marital birth proportion among high-school-educated whites has quadrupled, to 50%, and the same figure for college-educated blacks has fallen by a third, to 25%. Thus the class divide is growing even as the racial gap is shrinking.\n\nUpbringing affects opportunity. Upper-middle-class homes are not only richer (with two professional incomes) and more stable; they are also more nurturing. In the 1970s there were practically no class differences in the amount of time that [[parents]] spent talking, reading and playing with toddlers. Now the children of college-educated [[parents]] receive 50% more of what Mr Putnam calls \"Goodnight Moon\" time (after a popular book for infants).\n\nEducated [[parents]] engage in a non-stop Socratic dialogue with their children, helping them to make up their own minds about right and wrong, true and false, wise and foolish. This is exhausting, so it helps to have a reliable spouse with whom to share the burden, not to mention cleaners, nannies and cash for trips to the theatre.\n\nWorking-class [[parents]], who have less spare capacity, are more likely to demand that their kids simply obey them. In the short run this saves time; in the long run it prevents the kids from learning to organise their own lives or think for themselves. Poor parenting is thus a barrier to social mobility, and is becoming more so as the world grows more complex and the rewards for superior cognitive skills increase.\n\nMr Putnam's research team interviewed dozens of families to illustrate his thesis. Some of their stories are heart-rending. Stephanie, a mother whose husband left her, is asked if her own [[parents]] were warm. She is \"astonished at our naïveté\". \"No, we don't do all that kissing and hugging,\" she says. \"You can't be mushy in Detroit\\...You gotta be hard, really hard, because if you soft, people will bully you.\" Just as her [[parents]] \"beat the hell\" out of her, so she \"whups\" her own children. She does her best, but her ambitions for them go little further than not skipping school, not becoming alcoholic and not ending up on the streets.\n\nAt every stage, educated families help their kids in ways that less educated ones do not or cannot. Whereas working-class families have friends who tend to know each other (because they live in the same neighbourhood), professional families have much wider circles. If a problem needs solving or a door needs opening, there is often a friend of a friend (a lawyer, a psychiatrist, an executive) who knows how to do it or whom to ask.\n\nStunningly, Mr Putnam finds that family background is a better predictor of whether or not a child will graduate from university than 8th-grade test scores. Kids in the richest quarter with low test scores are as likely to make it through college as kids in the poorest quarter with high scores (see chart).\n\n![](media/image6.png){width=\"6.093055555555556in\" height=\"3.0in\"}There are no obvious villains in this story. Mr Murray suggested that the educated classes preach the values they practise by urging the poor to get married before they have children. But the record of those who tell other people how to arrange their [[love]] lives is hardly encouraging. Both George W. Bush and Barack [[Obama]] preached the virtues of responsible fatherhood, to no obvious effect.\n\nMr Putnam sees \"no clear path to reviving marriage\" among the poor. Instead, he suggests a grab-bag of policies to help poor kids reach their potential, such as raising subsidies for poor families, teaching them better parenting skills, improving nursery care and making after-school baseball clubs free. He urges all 50 states to experiment to find out what works. A problem this complex has no simple solution.\n\n![](media/image7.png){width=\"7.4988779527559055in\" height=\"2.3673468941382327in\"}\n\n![](media/image8.png){width=\"3.6666666666666665in\" height=\"7.902083333333334in\"}\n\n![](media/image9.png){width=\"4.434027777777778in\" height=\"3.4520833333333334in\"}\n\n![](media/image10.png){width=\"4.0in\" height=\"1.038888888888889in\"}\n\n[![Fast Facts](media/image11.gif){width=\"0.3125in\" height=\"0.3125in\"}[  Fast Facts]{.ul}](http://nces.ed.gov/FastFacts/) \\-- <http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=372>\n\n#### Back to school statistics\n\n**College and University [[Education]]**\n\n*Enrollment*\n\nThe number of students projected to attend American colleges and universities in fall 2018 is 19.9 million, which is higher than the enrollment of 15.3 million students in fall 2000... Females are expected to account for the majority of college and university students in fall 2018: about 11.2 million females will attend in fall 2018, compared with 8.7 million males.\n\n*Postsecondary Demographics*: Higher numbers and percentages of Black and Hispanic students are attending colleges and universities. The percentage of all students attending colleges and universities who were Black was higher in 2016 than in 2000 (13.7 vs. 11.7 percent), and the percentage who were Hispanic rose from 9.9 to 18.2 percent over the same time period [(source)](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d17/tables/dt17_306.10.asp).\n\n*Postsecondary Finance:* For the 2016--17 academic year, the average annual price for undergraduate tuition, fees, room, and board was \\$17,237 at public institutions, \\$44,551 at private nonprofit institutions, and \\$25,431 at private for-profit institutions. Charges for tuition and required fees averaged \\$6,817 at public institutions, \\$32,556 at private nonprofit institutions, and \\$14,419 at private for-profit institutions [(source)](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d17/tables/dt17_330.10.asp).\n\n*Labor Force Outcomes:* In 2016, about 78.8 percent of 25- to 34-year-olds with a bachelor\\'s or higher degree in the labor force had year-round, full-time jobs, compared with 72.3 percent of those with an associate\\'s degree, 69.5 percent of those with some college [[education]], 68.9 percent of those who completed high school, and 60.1 percent of those without a high school diploma or its equivalent [(source)](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d17/tables/dt17_502.30.asp). In 2017, the [[unemployment]] rate for 25- to 34-year-olds with a bachelor's or higher degree (2.5 percent) was lower than the rate for young adults with some college (4.4 percent), those who had completed high school (7.2 percent), and those who had not completed high school (13.2 percent) [(source)](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d17/tables/dt17_501.80.asp).\n\nIn 2016, for young adults ages 25--34 who worked full time, year round, higher educational attainment was associated with higher median earnings; this pattern was consistent from 2000 through 2016. For example, in 2016, the median earnings of young adults with a bachelor\\'s degree (\\$50,000) were 57 percent higher than those of young adult high school completers (\\$31,800). The median earnings of young adult high school completers were 26 percent higher than those of young adults who did not complete high school (\\$25,400). In addition, in 2016, the median earnings of young adults with a master\\'s or higher degree were \\$64,100, some 28 percent higher than those of young adults with a bachelor\\'s degree (\\$50,000) [(source)](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cba.asp).\n\n# \n\n# \n\n### An hereditary meritocracy\n\n# The children of the rich and powerful are increasingly well suited to earning wealth and power themselves. That's a problem\n\nJan 24th 2015 \\| WASHINGTON, DC \\| [From the print edition](http://www.economist.com/printedition/2015-01-24)\n\n...Before the word meritocracy was coined by Michael Young, a British sociologist and institutional entrepreneur, in the [[1950s]] there was a different name for the notion that power, success and wealth should be distributed according to talent and diligence, rather than by accident of birth: American. For sure, [[America]] has always had rich and powerful families, from the floor of the Senate to the boardrooms of the steel industry. But it has also held more fervently than any other country the belief that all comers can penetrate that elite as long as they have talent, perseverance and gumption.\n\nSome [[self]]-perpetuation by elites is unavoidable; the children of [[America]]'s top dogs benefit from nepotism just as those in all other societies do. But something else is now afoot. More than ever before, [[America]]'s elite is producing children who not only get ahead, but deserve to do so: they meet the standards of meritocracy better than their peers, and are thus worthy of the status they inherit.\n\nIt takes two\n\n![](media/image12.png){width=\"2.6559459755030623in\" height=\"2.446153762029746in\"}This is partly the result of various admirable aspects of American society: the willingness of people to give money and time to their children's schools; a reluctance to impose a uniform model of [[education]] across the country; competition between universities to build the most lavish facilities. Such traits are hard to object to, and even if one does object they are yet harder to do anything about. In aggregate, though, they increase the chances of wealthy [[parents]] passing advantage on to their children. In the long run that could change the way the country works, the way it thinks about itself, and the way that people elsewhere judge its claim to be an exceptional beacon of opportunity.\n\nPart of the change is due to the increased opportunities for [[education]] and employment won by American [[women]] in the twentieth century. A larger pool of [[women]] enjoying academic and professional success, or at least showing early signs of doing so, has made it easier for pairs of young adults who will both excel to get together. Between 1960 and 2005 the share of men with university degrees who married [[women]] with university degrees nearly doubled, from 25% to 48%, and the change shows no sign of going into reverse.\n\nAssortative mating of this sort seems likely, on average, to reinforce the traits that bring the couple together. Though genes play a role in the variation of intelligence from person to person, this is not a crude genetic determinism. People tend to encourage in their children what they value in themselves and their partners. Thus people bought together by their [[education]] and status will typically deem such things important and do more to bring them out in their children, both deliberately and by lived example---processes in which nature and nurture are more than likely to work hand in hand.\n\nNot only do graduate couples tend to value [[education]]; they also tend to have money to spend on it. And though the best predictor of an American child's success in school has long been the [[parents]]' educational level---a factor which graduates are already ahead on, by defintition---money is an increasingly important factor. According to Sean Reardon of Stanford the past decades have seen a growing correlation between parental income and children's test scores. Sort the students who took the SAT, a test for college applicants, in 2014 by parental income and the results get steadily better the further up the ladder you climb (see chart 1).\n\nFirst, cultivate your kindergarten\n\nAnother factor is family stability. Wealthier and better educated American families tend to marry before having children, and like most married couples they split up less than unmarried ones. This correlates with various good outcomes for their children.\n\nThe educational benefits of being born to wealthy [[parents]] are already clear in toddlers (see [[article]{.ul}](http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21640315-early-[[education]]-matters-it-not-everything-getting-em-young)). Families which are used to and eager for success try to build on them at kindergarten. Competition for private kindergarten places among high-status New Yorkers is farcically intense. Jennifer Brozost of Peas, an educational consultancy, recommends that [[parents]] apply to 8-10 kindergartens, write \"[[love]] letters\" to their top three, and bone up on how to make the right impression when visiting. Some [[parents]] pay for sessions at which their children are coached on how to play in a way that pleases those in charge of admissions.\n\n![](media/image13.png){width=\"2.9722222222222223in\" height=\"6.004861111111111in\"}Once children enter the public school system---which about 90% of them do---the advantages of living in a well-off neighbourhood kick in. [[America]] is unusual in funding its public schools through property taxes. States have a floor price for the [[education]] of each child, but [[parents]] can vote to pay more local tax in order to top this up, and frequently do. Funding levels per pupil can vary by up to 50% across a state, says Mike McShane of the American Enterprise Institute, a think-tank.\n\nSometimes this results in poor students in cities that collect lots of property tax being better funded than the children of wealthier families in the suburbs. More often, though, the opposite is true. The result is that [[America]] is one of only three advanced countries that spends more on richer pupils than poor ones, according to the OECD (the other two are Turkey and [[Israel]]). And on top of spending on school, there is spending outside it: the gap between what rich and poor [[parents]] shell out for museum trips, music lessons, books and so on has been widening (see \"... But it's not fair,\" Chart 2, previous page). In a world where lots of people do well on SATs, cultivating extra skills matters.\n\nThe opportunities for parental investment continue in higher [[education]], which is ever more costly (see chart 3, previous page) but offers ever greater returns. Between 1979 and 2012 the income gap between the median family with college-educated [[parents]] and one with high-school educated [[parents]] grew four times greater than the headline-grabbing income gap between the top 1% of earners and the rest, according to David Autor of MIT, rising from \\$30,000 to \\$58,000.\n\nThose whose [[parents]] have provided good schooling and good after-schooling have advantages already---but some get an extra one from institutions that discriminate in favour of the children of alumni. According to a survey by the *Crimson*, Harvard's newspaper, 16% of the 2,023 who got in last year had at least one parent among the university's alumni. Harvard says that legacy preference is only ever a tie breaker in admissions; but with 17 applicants for every place there can be a lot of ties.\n\nAll this and lacrosse too\n\nMost of the country's research universities and liberal arts colleges grant preferences to legacy students; the practice seems widespread at universities just below the top tier. The University of Pennsylvania is particularly friendly to the children of alumni, says Katherine Cohen of Ivywise, a firm with several ex-deans of admissions on its books which provides advice on getting children into the best schools. Though it is rare, stories still crop up of the [[parents]] of academically borderline students buying admission for their children with a generous bequest to a particular school.\n\nThe fierce competition between universities to build endowments makes doing such favours for alumni enticing. And there is a public-good argument for it: a student who comes with \\$1m attached can pay for financial aid for many others. But in practice this is not how the system works. While it is true that some elite universities are rich enough to give out a lot of financial support, people who can pay the full whack are still at the centre of the [[business]] model for many. Mitchell Stevens, a Stanford sociologist who spent a year working in the admissions office of an unnamed liberal arts college in the north-east, found that the candidate the system most prized was one who could pay full tuition and was just good enough to make one of the higher-profile sports teams but had a strong enough academic record not to eat into the annual allocation reserved for students whose brains work best when encased in a football helmet.\n\nOn graduation, many members of [[America]]'s future elite will head for the law firms, banks and consultancies where starting salaries are highest. Lauren Rivera of Kellogg School of Management interviewed 120 people charged with hiring in these sectors for a forthcoming book. She found that though they did not set out to recruit students from wealthy backgrounds, the companies had a penchant for graduates who had been to well-known universities and played varsity sports (lacrosse correlates with success particularly well). The result was a graduate intake that included people with skin of every shade but rarely anyone with [[parents]] who worked blue-collar jobs. \"When we are asked to identify merit,\" explains Ms Rivera, \"we tend to find people like ourselves.\"\n\nSomething similar has happened in corner offices of [[America]]'s biggest companies. As computing power has increased and clerical jobs have been automated, the distance between the shop floor and executive positions has increased. It was never common for people to start at the bottom and work their way to the top. Now it is close to impossible. Research by Nitin Nohria, the dean of Harvard [[Business]] School, and his colleagues has shown how in the second half of the 20th century a corporate elite where family networks and [[religion]] mattered most was replaced by one whose members required an MBA or similar qualification from a [[business]] school. This makes the managers better qualified. It also means they are the product of a serial filtering that has winnowed their numbers at school, college and work before they get their MBAs.\n\nMore than 50 years ago Michael Young warned that the incipient meritocracy to which he had given a name could be as narrow and pernicious, in its way, as aristocracies of old. In [[America]] some academics and thinkers on [[the left]] are coming to similar conclusions.\n\n# \n\n# *Extensive Data Shows Punishing Reach of Racism for Black Boys*\n\n**By [EMILY BADGER](https://www.nytimes.com/by/emily-badger), [CLAIRE CAIN MILLER](http://www.nytimes.com/by/claire-cain-miller), [ADAM PEARCE](https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-pearce) and [KEVIN QUEALY](http://www.nytimes.com/by/kevin-quealy) **\n\nMARCH 19, 2018\n\nBlack boys raised in [[America]], even in the wealthiest families and living in some of the most well-to-do neighborhoods, still earn less in adulthood than white boys with similar backgrounds, according to a sweeping new study that traced the lives of millions of children.\n\nWhite boys who grow up rich are likely to remain that way. Black boys raised at the top, however, are more likely to become poor than to stay wealthy in their own adult households.\n\nMost white boys  raised in wealthy families will stay rich or upper [[middle class]] as adults, but black boys  raised in similarly rich households will not.\n\nGrew up rich\n\nAdult outcomes reflect household incomes in 2014 and 2015.\n\nEven when children grow up next to each other with [[parents]] who earn similar incomes, black boys fare worse than white boys in 99 percent of [[America]]. And the gaps only worsen in the kind of neighborhoods that promise low [[poverty]] and good schools.\n\nAccording to the study, led by researchers at Stanford, Harvard and the Census Bureau, income inequality between blacks and whites is driven entirely by [what is happening among these boys](http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/assets/documents/race_summary.pdf) and the men they become. Though black girls and [[women]] face deep inequality on many measures, black and white girls from families with comparable earnings attain similar individual incomes as adults.\n\nLarge income gaps persist between men --- but not [[women]].\n\nBlack men consistently earn less than white men, regardless of whether they're raised poor or rich. No such income gap exists between black and white [[women]] raised in similar households. \"You would have thought at some point you escape the [[poverty]] trap,\" said Nathaniel Hendren, a Harvard economist and an author of the study. Black boys --- even rich black boys --- can seemingly never assume that.\n\n[The study](http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/), based on anonymous earnings and demographic data for virtually all [[America|Americans]] now in their late 30s, debunks a number of other widely held hypotheses about income inequality. Gaps persisted even when black and white boys grew up in families with the same income, similar family structures, similar [[education]] levels and even similar levels of accumulated wealth.\n\nThe disparities that remain also can't be explained by differences in cognitive ability, an argument made by people who cite racial gaps in test scores that appear for both black boys and girls. If such inherent differences existed by race, \"you've got to explain to me why these putative ability differences aren't handicapping [[women]],\" said David Grusky, a Stanford sociologist who has reviewed the research.\n\nA more likely possibility, the authors suggest, is that test scores don't accurately measure the abilities of black children in the first place.\n\nIf this inequality can't be explained by individual or household traits, much of what matters probably lies outside the home --- in surrounding neighborhoods, in the [[economy]] and in a society that views black boys differently from white boys, and even from black girls.\n\n\"One of the most popular liberal post-racial ideas is the idea that the fundamental problem is class and not race, and clearly this study explodes that idea,\" said Ibram Kendi, a professor and director of the Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American University. \"But for whatever reason, we're unwilling to stare [[racism]] in the face.\"\n\nThe authors, including the Stanford economist Raj Chetty and two census researchers, Maggie R. Jones and Sonya R. Porter, tried to identify neighborhoods where poor black boys do well, and as well as whites.\n\n\"The problem,\" Mr. Chetty said, \"is that there are essentially no such neighborhoods in [[America]].\"\n\nThe few neighborhoods that met this standard were in areas that showed less discrimination in surveys and tests of racial bias. They mostly had low [[poverty]] rates. And, intriguingly, these pockets --- including parts of the Maryland suburbs of Washington, and corners of Queens and the Bronx --- were the places where many lower-income black children had fathers at home. Poor black boys did well in such places, whether their own fathers were present or not.\n\n**Share of children living in low-[[poverty]] neighborhoods with many fathers present** 63% of white kids / 4% of black kids\n\n**Share of children living in high-[[poverty]] neighborhoods with few fathers present** 1% of white kids / 66% of black kids\n\n\"That is a pathbreaking finding,\" said William Julius Wilson, a Harvard sociologist whose books have chronicled the economic struggles of black men. \"They're not talking about the direct effects of a boy's own [[parents]]' marital status. They're talking about the presence of fathers in a given census tract.\"\n\nOther fathers in the community can provide boys with role models and mentors, researchers say, and their presence may indicate other neighborhood factors that benefit families, like lower incarceration rates and better job opportunities.\n\nThe research makes clear that there is something unique about the obstacles black males face. The gap between Hispanics and whites is narrower, and their incomes will converge within a couple of generations if mobility stays the same. Asian-[[America|Americans]] earn more than whites raised at the same income level, or about the same when first-generation immigrants are excluded. Only Native [[America|Americans]] have an income gap comparable to African-[[America|Americans]]. But the disparities are widest for black boys.\n\nFor poor children, the pattern is reversed. Most poor black boys  will remain poor as adults. White boys  raised in poor families fare far better.\n\nGrew up poor\n\n\"This crystallizes and puts data behind this thing that we always knew was there because we either felt it ourselves or we've seen it over time,\" said Will Jawando, 35, who worked in the [[Obama]] White House on [My Brother's Keeper](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/node/279811#section-about-my-brothers-keeper), a mentoring initiative for black boys. Even without this data, the people who worked on that project, he said, believed that individual and structural [[racism]] targeted black men in ways that required policies devised specifically for them.\n\nMr. Jawando, the son of a Nigerian father and a white mother, grew up poor in Silver Spring, Md. The Washington suburb contains some of the rare neighborhoods where black and white boys appear to do equally well. Mr. Jawando, who identifies as black, is now a married lawyer with three daughters. He is among the black boys who climbed from the bottom to the top.\n\nHe was one of the 20 million children born between 1978 and 1983 whose lives are reflected in the study. Using census data that included tax files, the researchers were able to link the adult fortunes of those children to their [[parents]]' incomes. Names and addresses were hidden from the researchers.\n\nPrevious research suggests some reasons there may be a large income gap between black and white men, but not between [[women]], even though [[women]] of color face both sexism and [[racism]].\n\nOther studies show that [boys, across races](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/upshot/a-disadvantaged-start-hurts-boys-more-than-girls.html), are more sensitive than girls to disadvantages like growing up in [[poverty]] or facing discrimination. While black [[women]] also face negative effects of [[racism]], black men often experience racial discrimination differently. As [early as preschool](http://ziglercenter.yale.edu/publications/briefs.aspx), they are more likely to be disciplined in school. They are pulled over or detained and searched by police officers more often.\n\n\"It's not just being black but being male that has been hyper-stereotyped in this negative way, in which we've made black men scary, intimidating, with a propensity toward violence,\" said Noelle Hurd, a psychology professor at the University of Virginia.\n\nShe said this racist stereotype particularly hurts black men economically, now that service-sector jobs, requiring interaction with customers, have replaced the manufacturing jobs that previously employed men with less [[education]].\n\nThe new data shows that 21 percent of black men raised at the very bottom were incarcerated, according to a snapshot of a single day during the 2010 census. Black men raised in the top 1 percent --- by millionaires --- were as likely to be incarcerated as white men raised in households earning about \\$36,000.\n\nThe sons of black families from the top 1 percent had about the same chance of being incarcerated on a given day as the sons of white families earning \\$36,000.\n\nAt the same time, [boys benefit more](http://www.nber.org/papers/w17541) than girls from adult attention and resources, as do low-income and nonwhite children, a [variety](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2940620) of[ studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1449212/) have found. Mentors who aren't children's [[parents]], but who share those children's [[gender]] and race, serve a particularly important role for black children, Ms. Hurd has [found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2752426/). That helps explain why the presence of black fathers in a neighborhood, even if not in a child's home, appears to make a difference.\n\nSome of the widest black-white income gaps in this study appear in wealthy communities. This fits with [previous](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20063978?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) [research](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2083415?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) that has shown that the [effects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17274219) of racial discrimination [cross class lines](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-soc-081309-150047). Although all children [benefit](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/04/upshot/an-atlas-of-upward-mobility-shows-paths-out-of-[[poverty]].html) from growing up in places with higher incomes and more resources, black children do not benefit nearly as much as white children do. Moving black boys to opportunity is no guarantee they can tap into it.\n\n\"Simply because you're in an area that is more affluent, it's still hard for black boys to present themselves as independent from the stereotype of black criminality,\" said Khiara Bridges, a professor of law and anthropology at Boston University who has written a coming paper on discrimination against affluent [[black people]].\n\nThis dynamic still weighs on Mr. Jawando. He has a good income, multiple degrees and political aspirations --- he is running for county council in Montgomery County, where he grew up. But in his own community, he is careful to dress like a professional.\n\n\"I think if I'm putting on a sweatsuit, if I go somewhere, will I be seen as just kind of a hood black guy?\" he said. \"Or will people recognize me at all?\" Those small daily decisions --- to wear a blazer or not --- follow him despite his success. \"I don't think you escape those things,\" he said.\n\n## OTHER FINDINGS FROM THE RESEARCH\n\nThis study makes it possible to look in greater detail at interrelated disparities that researchers have long studied around income, marriage rates and incarceration. Here are some of the other findings.\n\nThere's a large gap in the marriage rates of white and black [[America|Americans]], even after accounting for income.\n\nOne reason income gaps between whites and blacks appear so large at the household level is that black men and [[women]] are less likely to be married. That means their households are more likely to have a single income --- not two. For this reason and others, many point to differences in family structure as a primary driver of racial income inequality. If black children don't have married [[parents]], the argument goes, they're more likely to grow up with fewer resources and less adult attention at home.\n\nThis study found, however, that broad income disparities still exist between black and white men even when they're raised in homes with the same incomes *and* the same family structure.\n\nThe income gap exists for black and white boys if they had one parent in the house or two. A black man raised by two [[parents]] together in the 90th percentile --- making around \\$140,000 a year --- earns about the same in adulthood as a white man raised by a single mother making \\$60,000 alone.\n\nThe high mobility rate for Asian-[[America|Americans]] is partly about immigration. Asian-[[America|Americans]] earn more in adulthood than whites who were raised in families with similar incomes. But that advantage largely disappears when the researchers look only at children whose [[parents]] were born in [[America|the United States]]. Non-immigrant Asian-[[America|Americans]] fare about as well in the [[economy]] as whites. (The study did not divide immigrant mothers into smaller groups by origin.)\n\nThe worst places for poor white children are almost all better than the best places for poor black children.\n\nIn previous work, some of these same researchers looked at how the prospects for poor children vary depending on where they grow up. The middle map above shows those earlier results: Poor children appeared to have less opportunity in the Southeast and more in the Northern Great Plains. With the new data, it's now possible to look at the effects of geography separately for blacks and whites.\n\nPoor white children struggle in parts of the Southeast and Appalachia. But they still fare better there than poor black children do in most of [[America]]. In effect, the worst places for whites produce outcomes that are about as good as the best places for blacks. These new maps also suggest that part of the reason the Southeast looks bad for *all* children, in the middle map, is that the region is home to many black children who fare particularly poorly there.\n\nVery few nonwhite [[America|Americans]] started at the very top.\n\nAfrican-[[America|Americans]] made up about 35 percent of all children raised in the bottom 1 percent of the income distribution. They made up less than 1 percent of the children at the very top. This picture captures both a source of racial inequality and a consequence of it. White children are more likely to start life with economic advantages. But we now know that even when they start with the same advantages as black children, white boys still fare better, only reinforcing the disparities seen here.\n\n## The Real Starting Positions\n\nThe ladder charts so far have shown equal numbers of black and white boys raised by rich or poor families --- what would happen, in other words, if we started with 10,000 boys, and half were black and half white.\n\nIn reality, whites and blacks are not represented equally across the income spectrum. More than two-thirds of black boys are raised by poor or lower-middle-class families, while more than half of white boys are raised by rich or upper-middle-class families. The chart below depicts boys from every income quintile -- not just the top or bottom ones -- proportioned according to their real starting places in life.\n\nNote: Data does not include unauthorized immigrants\n\nSource: \"Race and Economic Opportunity in [[America|the United States]]: An Intergenerational Perspective\" by Raj Chetty, Nathaniel Hendren, Maggie R.

An overlooked [[government]] program from the nineties tried to answer that question. Recently, it has been getting new attention.*\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST: The American dream is supposed to go like this - with the right effort, a person or family can climb from the bottom of the economic ladder to the top. Study after study shows that\\'s getting harder to do. So Karen Duffin from our Planet Money podcast went looking for [[government]] programs that might help change that.\n\nKAREN DUFFIN, BYLINE: Once upon a time, in a cubicle not so far away, sat a [[government]] bureaucrat in his [[government]]-issued chair.\n\nMARK SHRODER: I was new to HUD. This was, like, my first couple months of HUD.\n\nDUFFIN: This is Mark Shroder, and HUD is the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Shroder was an economist there in 1991, when HUD was trying to test a theory - could they improve a family\\'s odds of climbing the economic ladder just by moving them to a better neighborhood? It would be a big social experiment, and they would call it Moving to Opportunity.\n\nSHRODER: Almost everything about Moving to Opportunity has been a surprise, not only to me but to practically everybody else.\n\nDUFFIN: Here\\'s how the experiment worked - HUD chose thousands of families who lived in public housing in five big cities.\n\nSHRODER: Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York.\n\nDUFFIN: They split the families into three groups, by lottery, and one of these groups was required to move out of public housing into, specifically, a low-[[poverty]] neighborhood. The [[government]] would help them cover rent in that new neighborhood by way of what\\'s known as a Section 8 voucher. So this should be a better neighborhood, hopefully more opportunity. But not everyone saw it that way.\n\nSHRODER: There were some people who were praying, literally praying, they would be in the regular voucher group.\n\nDUFFIN: Was that disappointing?\n\nSHRODER: That wasn\\'t that surprising.\n\nDUFFIN: Historically, families who\\'d gotten Section 8 vouchers were not using them to move to lower-[[poverty]] areas for a lot of complex reasons, both personal and systemic. But thousands of families did sign up, and for four years, they moved. HUD gathered data on them, and then in 2008, HUD tallied the data.\n\nSHRODER: We did not find any impacts on earnings or children\\'s test scores.\n\nDUFFIN: HUD\\'s theory was wrong. The moves had basically no economic or educational impact. And this was a landmark study, so researchers took the findings and moved their hopes, dollars and programs elsewhere - basically stopped looking at housing as a way to fix the American dream. But then about six years later, another economist was studying upward mobility.\n\nNATHAN HENDREN: My name is Nathan Hendren. I am a professor of [[economy|economics]] at Harvard.\n\nDUFFIN: Hendren and a few of his research pals were combing through income tax data when they spotted a pattern that surprised them.\n\nHENDREN: We started to see these exposure effect patterns; that the longer a child spent in a neighborhood with higher rates of upward mobility, the higher their outcomes were in adulthood.\n\nDUFFIN: But that contradicted what that big HUD study found. As they dug deeper, they realized HUD had stopped looking at the data too soon. The younger kids who moved to opportunity just hadn\\'t started getting jobs by then.\n\nHENDREN: Back in 2008, you wouldn\\'t have seen it. There just weren\\'t enough young children into the labor market where you\\'d really be able to say, ah, looks like there\\'s an effect here.\n\nDUFFIN: But for kids who moved before they turned 13\\...\n\nHENDREN: The children were 4 percentage points more likely to go to college, had about 30% higher earnings.\n\nDUFFIN: And bonus - these kids will likely pay more in income tax over time, so the program should essentially pay for itself.\n\nHENDREN: You could kind of feel that we had something that was going to change the way people thought about equality of opportunity in [[America|the United States]].\n\nDUFFIN: Hendren and his colleagues decided to not just release data but to turn it into an actual program. They\\'re currently working with cities to basically reboot the original HUD program, starting in Seattle. [[Congress]] also just passed a bipartisan law to run programs like this. And the researchers hope that, over time, they can take what they learned from the families that moved to opportunity and move that opportunity back into the neighborhoods they left behind.\n\n# \n\n![](media/image14.png){width=\"6.8974354768153985in\" height=\"8.996120953630797in\"}\n\n![](media/image15.png){width=\"7.2653062117235345in\" height=\"9.342804024496937in\"}\n\n**\\\n\n**\n\n![](media/image16.png){width=\"7.081632764654418in\" height=\"9.549300087489064in\"}\n\n![](media/image17.png){width=\"7.01994094488189in\" height=\"9.62559820647419in\"}**\\\n**\n\n![](media/image18.png){width=\"7.01994094488189in\" height=\"9.571428258967629in\"}\n\n**\\\n\n**![](media/image19.png){width=\"7.0612237532808395in\" height=\"9.265277777777778in\"}\n\n**\\\n\n**\n\n![](media/image20.png){width=\"7.02040791776028in\" height=\"9.716057524059492in\"}\n","degree":2,"nameLength":17},"position":{"x":1211.613702283573,"y":252.80012993449606},"group":"nodes","removed":false,"selected":true,"selectable":true,"locked":false,"grabbable":true,"pannable":false,"classes":"note filtered"},{"data":{"id":"core:Government Exam #2 Study Guide.md","name":"Government Exam #2 Study Guide","path":"00_Meta/Primary Sources/Classes/History/Government Exam #2 Study Guide.md","content":"**GOVERNMENT EXAM #2 OUTLINE**\n\n1.

What are the associated stereotypes? Prejudices? Include film examples\n\nAaron [[Bopp]] - Ethnographic Film Study -- 2/7/2019\n\n[[Masculinity]] is something that many young men struggle with today. For most of history, men have been at the top of the social, political, and physical food chain. This has created many stereotypes about what masculinity is and the way that men act, but in recent years these notions have started to be questioned. With the rise of [[feminism]], the continuing acceptance of the LGBTQ movement and of [[non-binary]] genders, the male-centric society that has existed for centuries has started to break-down, or at least adapt. Now more than ever it is accepted and even celebrated when a person defies [[gender]] stereotypes. Unfortunately, this is a very recent development. In Barry Jenkin's 2016 film *Moonlight,* he follows the life of black child, Chiron, living in Liberty City, Miami in the mid 1980's. In this film Jenkins addresses many issues relating to masculinity, the stereotypes of masculinity, and how they affect Chiron's upbringing. The movie is divided into three parts that correspond to three stages in Chiron's life. These parts also correspond to Chiron's view towards masculinity.\n\nIn part one Chiron's view towards masculinity is one of [[ignorance]]. Chiron doesn't understand what masculinity is and therefore doesn't understand why he is not accepted by his peers. The audience sees many scenes where Chiron is ostracized by groups of his peers. The audience gets the clearest reason for his position from a scene with his mother, Paula. Throughout the film Paula's struggles more and more with drugs. One particular trip she says that the reason Chiron gets beaten up so much is the way he walks. This coupled with a scene where Chiron is dancing much more flamboyantly than anyone else in music class, shows the audience one of the reasons that Chiron is being picked on. According to <u>The Bullied Boy,</u> an article by Paul Horton, masculinism is what leads many young boys to bullying. Masculinism is the belief that a male is supposed to be dominant, and this trait is common in school boys. He says,\" For boys, then, the question is not whether to take on a typical male sex role, but rather how to position themselves according to the masculine discourses available to them\" (Horton, 2018). Chiron has failed to position himself so that he will look normal. The film shows this to the audience through the only other boy the film develops extensively, Chiron's friend Kevin. Kevin is just as small as Chiron but has learned how to fit into the group. Kevin attempts to teach Chiron how to do this, but as the audience will see in part two, it doesn't work.\n[[INDEX#Entry Points]]\n\nIn part one, Chiron was unaware of the reasons he was being picked on other than that he was small and easy to beat. In part two, he is painfully aware of the things that his peers are doing that he is not. Chiron is now in high school and with high school the aspects of masculinity change, from playing ball and wrestling, to getting girls and doing drugs. Whether it is by his choice or not, Chiron does not actively participate in these kinds of things with his peers, but that does not mean he does not [[desire]] them. Kevin talks to Chiron one day about how he had sex with a girl in the stairwell. Chiron is obviously flustered and possibly jealous, but in a dream sequence the next night Chiron sees Kevin with a girl. This scene shows Chiron's jealousy of Kevin's sexual activity or perhaps his [[desire]] for intimacy. Near the end of part two there is a scene where Kevin and Chiron have an sexually intimate moment on a beach. They have conversation and the audience sees a rare moment of contentment for Chiron. This night is perhaps the beginning of Chiron accepting himself and realizing that he can have value without being traditionally masculine. Unfortunately, over the next few days Chiron's bullying escalates and he retaliates by beating his bully with a chair. He is sent to juvenile detention in Georgia and his life is changed forever.\n\nIn part three the lanky, skinny Chiron is now replaced by a muscular, masculine Chiron. Throughout part two it seems that Chiron has become everything he wasn't in part two. He is now a drug dealer, seems interested in [[women]], and seems accepted by the people around him as an equal or even a role-model. However, when he meets back up with Kevin (whom he has not seen in ten years), it is revealed that it is all a scam. Chiron has learned to play the act of masculinity in order to survive in a world that would not accept his true [[self]]. Chiron reveals to Kevin that he has not been with another person, man or [[women]], since their night on the beach. This is an example of Dysfunction Strain as described in \"I Always Felt I had to Prove My Manhood.\" Dysfunction Strain is when a [[Queer|homosexual]] man feels that he must hyper-masculine in order to cover up his homosexuality (Fields, 2015). Chiron had created this personality to protect himself from the kind of abuse he suffered in his childhood, but when he is around someone who accepts him he can finally be free from the strain of living a lie.\n\n*Moonlight* is an excellent study into masculinity and its effects on the growth of person. *Moonlight* examines masculinity from two sides: the masculine, and the not. Chiron's bullies show us the kind of destructive nature that masculinity can bring to young children, and Chiron himself shows the mental strain it can put on a young adult. In this film Chiron goes from being to ignorant of masculinity, to desiring masculinity, to putting on the show of masculinity. The audience is left unsure of where Chiron's life will lead him, but it's not hard to believe that it will be better.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nErrol Lamont Fields, Laura M. Bogart, Katherine C.

Then, respond to all of the items. Your responses to each should be at least 0.5 double-spaced pages in size 12 font. To help, I grade 0.5 pages as 11 lines of content. If you have less than 11 lines, you will lose points for not writing enough.\n\n**<u>Section 1 (Summary):</u>** Summarize the piece. Be sure to explain what the piece was about in enough detail that it is clear that you watched/read/listened to the entire piece. Also, be sure to highlight aspects of the piece that show its relevance to race and/or [[gender]].\n\n==Tone shared a story about his childhood where he was pushed to steal from his teacher due to inequalities that his teacher was placing on his students. His teacher implemented a reward system of fake currency and a shop that accepted that currency. This currency was earned through good behavior and participation in her class and could be used to buy various things from her shop. This system fostered a very interesting market dynamic in her students, but it had an unintended side effect. Some of her students were in more classes with her than others, and thus had a more time to earn money. This meant that they were privileged compared to the other students, and there was nothing that Tone was able to do to correct this error, so he stole from the bank. He was then punished for this, despite the fact that he tried to correct the inequality in the correct way first.==\n\n**<u>Section 2 (Reading Connection):</u>** Discuss at least one **<u>reading from this week</u>** that relates to the piece. Be sure to explain which reading you are discussing, what the reading said about the topic, and how the reading is connected to the piece.\n\nThe dynamics of Tone's childhood classroom scarily mirror the system of privilege and oppression in society today. Those who were in multiple classes were able to get access to resources more easily than those in less classes, even if they were working the exact same amount. Even when Tone tried to correct this inequality by working with the teacher and going through the correct channels, his voice was not heard, and the inequality continued until he broke the rules. It was only through his anger and drastic action that his plight was truly heard and thankfully addressed, but even then those that had profited off of his desperation were left unpunished. This is a very simple representation of some of the system that keep systemic [[racism]] in place today. \"[[7 Ways We Know Systemic Racism Is Real]]\" establishes many of these inequalities, such as how white families hold 90% of the wealth, [[black people]] are more likely to be convicted, sentenced and receive longer sentences, and how these combine to lead to [[black people]] making up a disproportionate percentage of the [[prison]] population.\n\n**<u>Section 3 (Personal Reflection):</u>** Discuss how the piece relates to your own life experiences. Consider how the stories or information presented is similar to, or different from, what you've experienced. If the piece focuses on an identity very different from your own, you can think about how not having that identity has led to a different life. You can also discuss memories that the piece made you think of. You should <u>not</u> give your opinion or evaluation of the piece, and you should <u>not</u> just talk about how it made you feel (e.g. \"this topic makes me sad\").\n\nI can't really relate this piece to my life except in contrast, but I do find it interesting how the system of society are taught and pushed onto us at an early age. I was obsessed with Monopoly as a child, and I loved being able to collect and upgrade properties to slowly push people out of the game, but when I came back to the game later in life I was saddened by how similar it was to real life. The teacher's goal wasn't to create inequality in her classroom, but by modeling her system after capitalism, she also adopted some of its flaws. I was also never really punished as a child. [[My parents]] weren't very disciplinary, but I was also very well-behaved. I easily adapted to the systems that they set up in the home, and it wasn't until much later in life that I realized that my eagerness to adapt to these systems was not because they were fair, but because I did not realize there was a choice. I worked very, very hard to gain [[my parents]] approval when it was really never a possibility.

If you have less than 11 lines, you will lose points for not writing enough.\n\n**<u>Section 1 (Summary):</u>** Summarize the piece. Be sure to explain what the piece was about in enough detail that it is clear that you watched/read/listened to the entire piece. Also be sure to highlight aspects of the piece that show its relevance to race and/or [[gender]].\n\nTreyvon Martin was shot when going to get snacks at the store.\nActivist Sconik started a series called They Have a Name, that's goal was to make people aware of black kids being killed.\nZimmerman claimed that it was okay to shoot Treyvon because he \"looked like a thug.\"\nAt first this story was like any other, but as Zimmerman continued to not be arrested people started to notice, and push for justice.\nLebron James, Dwayne Wade, convinced the Miami heat to use their platform to raise awareness for Treyvon.\nThey took a picture in their team hoodies.\nThe hoodie was a symbol.\nThe photo was a protest.\nWe all have hoodies, but Treyvon was killed for wearing his.\nThis event reignited influencers like athletes using their platform for politics and helped bring about movements for justice, like Black Lives Matter.\nThe conversation never ends because the murder of [[black people]] never ends.\nPartially because of this it has become expected of influencers to use their platform to push for social change even if what they regularly do is completely unrelated.\nMovements like Black Lives Matter have found a lot of traction in raising awareness and support for [[black people]] being killed.\n\n\n**<u>Section 2 (Reading Connection):</u>** Discuss at least one **<u>reading from this week</u>** that relates to the piece. Be sure to explain which reading you are discussing, what the reading said about the topic, and how the reading is connected to the piece.\n\nThe murder of Treyvon Martin was likely an awakening moment in lots of [[black people]]'s identity development.\nBoth seeing Treyvon killed for such a pointless reason, and seeing no justice for his killer, brought a lot of awareness to way [[black people]] are treated differently in America. \nThe murder of Treyvon Martin and the response of the Miami heat are very important parts of the encounter stage of the Nigrescence Black Identity Model. \nTreyvon's murder is very easy to personalize because everybody wears hoodies and yet Treyvon was killed for wearing his. \nHe could look exactly like your nephew, your son, your brother, or even yourself, and was doing nothing wrong at the time of his death.\nAdditionally because of the way that new of Treyvon's death spread, it allowed it to be parred to positive and constructive messaging. \nActivists provided opportunities to fight for justice for Treyvon and change in the system, and influencers like the Miami Heat provided solidarity and support for those who were shocked by the event. \nThis is important to the identity model, because if an encounter is negative and invdividual may not be as willing to commit to the Immersion-Emersion Stage.\nThese events can also relate to the White Identity Model becaue both general messages of support, like the Miami Heat's, and specific message like Sconik's \"They Have a Name\" series push the existence of systemic [[racism]] into the [[conscious|consciousness]] of white people.\n\n\n**<u>Section 3 (Personal Reflection):</u>** Discuss how the piece relates to your own life experiences. Consider how the stories or information presented is similar to, or different from, what you've experienced. If the piece focuses on an identity very different from your own, you can think about how not having that identity has led to a different life. You can also discuss memories that the piece made you think of. You should <u>not</u> give your opinion or evaluation of the piece, and you should <u>not</u> just talk about how it made you feel (e.g. \"this topic makes me sad\").\n\nI think that a lot of white people and especially religious white people who are unaware of their privilege and the existence of systemic [[racism]] are hesitant to engage with stories like Treyvon's because it shatters their moral superiority. When I was a kid I believed that [[my parents]] and the church were in the moral majority, and I prided myself on the [[empathy]] I had for other people. I remember reading and sharing messages about how bad Obamacare was because I believed it was truly making peoples lives worse. My father repeatedly shares stories about how his father lead an African-American battalion in [[WW2|World War 2]]. Our core belief was that [[racism]] no longer existed and that our beliefs were generally correct and any questioning of that was a slight to my grandfather and to my [[empathy]]. So stories like Treyvon's would make us sad, but anything that pointed towards the root cause of systemic [[racism]], would immediately be discarded. I think this could affect why it is so exhausting for people of color to continually educate white people, and why so many people who espouse [[unconditional love]] are so unwilling to address systemic [[racism]]. \n\n","degree":1,"nameLength":18},"position":{"x":890.6261810859334,"y":745.7552140721416},"group":"nodes","removed":false,"selected":true,"selectable":true,"locked":false,"grabbable":true,"pannable":false,"classes":"note filtered"},{"data":{"id":"core:Psychology of Race and Gender notes.md","name":"Psychology of Race and Gender notes","path":"00_Meta/Primary Sources/Classes/Pyschology/Psychology of Race and Gender notes.md","content":"- Table mates\n\t- Kas Brady\n\t- Lydia Martin\n\n# Week 2\n- Readings \n\t- [[Replacement prod.pdf| Plaut et al.

In the article, the authors state that it is crucial that we define terms when discussing issues such as race, [[gender]], and bias. In this section, they also provide a [glossary of important terms](https://www.adl.org/education/resources/glossary-terms/education-glossary-terms) (viewable at this link). Read through ADL's glossary of terms and find <u>two</u> that you were unfamiliar with. For each, state what the term is, define the term, and briefly explain when that term might come up in conversations about race or [[gender]]. (If you already knew every term in the glossary, pick two that you are less familiar with.) **(3 pts)**\n\t- Heterosexism - oppression of **non**-heterosexual individuals. Synonym to homophobia\n\t\t- The term is homophobia is used liberally in today's culture, but I had never heard this related term. Unfortunately, I think both terms suffer from lack of specificity. Heterosexism first made me think of being sexist against straight people, and many people still don't know the definitions of heterosexual and [[Queer|homosexual]]. Homophobia isn't a perfect term either (\"I'm not scared of [[Queer|gay]] I just think they shouldn't have rights, so I'm not homophobic\") but I think it gets closer to the desired meaning. \n\t- [[Intersectionality]] - the *exponential* amount of oppression that people bear when they are part of multiple marginalized groups\n\t\t- I think when this term comes up people often think of the concept of the \"oppression olympics\" which refers to people maliciously trying to use their marginalized identities to gain moral superiority, but it is actually one of the most important tools for understanding how people who are part of multiple marginalized groups exist in today's society. \n\n### [[Replacement prod.pdf|Plaut et al. (2018) -- Colorblindness and Multiculturalism]]\n\n2. This article discusses how the colorblind and multicultural approach to diversity impact discrimination and [[racism]]. Using information from the article, discuss in detail one positive and one negative impact of colorblindness. Then, do the same thing for multiculturalism. Finally, based on the entire article, state which approach the authors would suggest is better for preventing discrimination and explain why. **(5 pts)**\n\t- One time colorblindness can be effective is when, \"it focuses on commonality without diminishing the experiences of marginalized groups.\" The situations that this can apply in are very limited because not diminishing the experience requires being aware of the way that marginalized groups are oppressed. This can happen if no groups are marginalized, which only happens in a completely homogenous society. Places like Scandinavia or Iowa which have largely white populations (90%+) have less blatant [[racism]] (racist acts) but I think there is a higher chance of microaggressions and unconscious bias.\n\t- One negative of colorblindness is, \"it is associated with lower endorsement of and willingness to adopt inclusive teaching practices.\" We cannot ignore the fact that we have a systemically racist society and government. Those who forget history are doomed to repeat. The methods of resolving these facts will vary across political ideology, but we are doing ourselves no favors by ignoring them.\n\t- One negative of multiculturalism is when, \"it creates an illusion of [[fairness]] and nondiscrimination.\" This is very important and the experience of many people of color in places that market themselves and inclusive and diverse while not fully or correctly enacting those ideals. This rightly leads people of color to find solace in groups of their own culture or in places that are owned and curated by people of their culture. Inclusivity cannot be a marketing tactic or a slogan, it needs to be a fundamental part of the ideology and creation of whatever space is claiming to be inclusive: [[business]], community, or government.\n\t- One positive of multiculturalism is when, \"it is associated with endorsement of and willingness to adopt inclusive teaching practices.\" This is the only path that we have to create a more inclusive society.  We need to be teaching inclusivity to everybody in order to build a path towards a more equitable society.\n\t- The authors conclude that while this situation has other major factors to be studied, colorblindness makes white people more comfortable and reduces the success of marginalized groups and multiculturalism makes white people less comfortable and increases the success of the marginalized groups. Multiculturalism makes white people less comfortable because it makes them aware of their place and privilege in society, and can lead to them resenting this fact and taking their anger out on marginalized groups. Colorblindness allows white people to completely forget about race, while marginalized groups feel forgotten by society and have lower outcomes. Multiculturalism increases the success of marginalized groups, despite any increased harassment they may receive. The authors conclude that both have their place in reducing present racial discrimination, but say that further research should look and long-term effects of these viewpoints, historical and institutional influences, and the direct success of marginalized groups. \n3. Think back on your own life.\n    -  In general, do you tend to take a multiculturalism or colorblind perspective when it comes to diversity? Why do you tend to take this approach? **(1 pts)**\n        - I have decided to take the multicultural perspective, even though my upbringing easily allowed for a colorblind perspective. I have had very few interactions with people of color and almost no interactions with [[racism]] in my personal life, but I have very clearly seen the systemic [[racism]] that people of color face in society and have seen the negative effects that colorblindness has in people around me. \n    -  After reading this article, do you think you will continue taking the approach you have in the past? Why or why not? **(2 pts)**\n        - I intend on continuing to learn about other cultures and try to bring them into my life more, and to find ways in which I can further anti-racist and multiculturalism movements. I think that the downsides of multiculturalism are mainly where white people are uncomfortable, and that is no reason to impede the success of people of color. I also think the only way to improve society is to make white people uncomfortable enough that they are forced to learn and change.\n\n### [[National SEED Project - 'White Privilege Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack' and 'Some Notes for Facilitators|McIntosh (1989) -- White Privilege]]\n\n4. Choose <u>*three*</u> of the items on McIntosh's (1989) list of privileges that you can relate to. State what the item is, and then describe your own experience of privilege related to that item.\n\t- \"I can do well in a challenging situation without being called a credit to my race.\" \n\t\t- When people see me do well they see my hard work and my talent, but when they see people of color do well they see an **exception** to the rule.\n\t- \"I am never asked to speak for all the people of my racial group.\" \n\t\t- I often see my family take the words of any single person of color that is reinforcing their views, but when I try to influence them, my words are immediately thrown away. They see people of color as a monolith and simply want someone to reinforce their bias.\n\t- \"I can be sure that if I need legal or medical help, my race will not work against me.\" \n\t\t- I have been able to easily access every medical resource available to me without fear that my doctors will not be knowledgeable about my experience or worse have a negative and inaccurate beliefs about the true cause of my illnesses. I have never been subject to unnecessary invasive medical procedures and my comfort of my doctor's minds.\n\n<u>Note:</u> Although this is a list of White privilege items, many can be applied to other identities. If you don't experience White privilege, think of the list in these terms instead. **(3 pts)**\n\n### [[Historical Foundations of Race|\"Historical Foundations of Race\" from Smithsonian Institute]]\n\n5. A big chunk of this article is made up of the section \"Paradox of Liberty in America's [[conscious|Consciousness]],\" which starts a little less than halfway down and continues until the section \"Reconstructing Race in the Nadir.\" Summarize in 1-2 paragraphs the entire \"Paradox\" section, being sure to explain what paradox the authors are referring to.  **(3 pts)**\n\t- This section discussed the cognitive dissonance that people in the America's had to feel at the founding of this country. While they were fighting for equal intrinsic rights they were stripping them from a large portion of society. The reasons behind this were clear, the heavy economic incentive to slavery, and this built a very a strong racial ideology in America. In order to continue slavery while fighting for freedom they stripped the humanity from their slaves in order to keep the enslaved.\n\n### [[Winton (2020) - Scientific Racism and North American Psychology 1.pdf|Winton (2020) -- Scientific Racism and North American Psychology]]\n\n6.

You should discuss two unique people, not two people who worked on the same thing. **(2 pts)**\n        - Bache argued that reaction times would be significantly different by race and that \"lower races\" would have faster times. This feels like a close relation to r/K theory because it likens races to species and expects significant evolutionary differences between them. Bache found whites to have the slowest reactions, meaning they were the most refined species, but other scientists who looked at his data and hypothesis' found no significant difference. Other's who looked at this did not even keep straight what faster reaction times should have meant.\n        - Goddard studied how intelligence and specifically the lack of it could be inherited and attributed to localities. Others used this to justify limitations on immigration based on race and to show a hereditary link to intelligence that apparentelly went through whole communities.\n    -  Discuss one explanation as to why scientific [[racism]] began to fade from psychology in the 1930s and 1940s. **(2 pts)**\n        - I think the most major reason for its decline was simply that there were more important things going on. The Great Deppression most likely took away some resources and people that may have worked on these studies, and WW2 showed what some of these beliefs could do if they were weilded by those in power.\n7.

For each, briefly summarize (in 2-3 sentences) the evidence presented for systemic [[racism]] and explain why you found that aspects particularly interesting. **(4 pts)**\n\t- **Criminal Justice**: African-[[America|Americans]] are more likely to be arrested, 20% more likely to get jail time, and get 20% longer sentences when compared to white people convicted of similar crimes. This results in a disproportionate amount of [[black people]] in [[prison]] (40% for 13% of the population) and disenfranchised (7.4% of African-American adults). I think these are some of the most shocking aspects of systemic [[racism]], as so many white people are brought believing that are our justice system is truly justice. I also think it is important because when you are looking at the causes for this discrimination, you see just how entrenched and present systemic [[racism]] still is today.\n\t- **Housing**: Since the 1940s loans company's and banks have devalued black owned homes, stopped [[black people]] from getting loans for new properties, and lead [[black people]] towards subprime loans. This has lead to all-time low of black ownership. This is so important because housing has historically been one of the best ways to pass on intergenerational wealth and is an appreciating asset, so the problem has only been compounding since it started. This lack of black wealth prevents them from accessing resources that could help counteract the effects of systemic [[racism]].\n\n\n**[[Gray et al. (2020) - COVID-19 and the Other Pandemic.pdf|Gray et al. (2020) -- COVID-19 and the Other Pandemic]]**\n\n2. As mentioned by the authors, the COVID-19 pandemic had a disproportionately negative impact on Black and American Indian communities, even though there is nothing about the virus that makes it more easily target people based on race. What, then, is happening?\n\n\t- Using information from the article, give <u>two</u> systemic reasons that these populations have been disproportionately affected, and explain why they would lead to higher COVID-19 infection rates. **(2 pts)**\n\t\t1. Black and indigenous people are more likely to be exposed to the virus. This is because they are over-represented as essential workers and because a lack of testing and treatment in poor communities and on reservations means that COVID-19 is more likely to spread, among other reasons\n\t\t2. Black and indigenous peoples are more likely to have pre-existing conditions. This is because of a history of mistreatment by the medical system, systemic poverty, and lack of opportunity for medical care. This leads to the higher mortality we see in these communities.\n\t- Discuss <u>one</u> solution given by the authors to help fix a systemic issue you highlighted in part A, and state whether you think this solution would be effective in fixing the issue. **(2 pts)**\n\t\t- I think the most effective solution offered was to declare [[racism]] a public health crisis. I think that is the most accurate way to describe issue and best shows the kind of action we need to have to solve it. [[Racism]] is not something that will go away over time or something that can be ignored, and this solution calls for ending it now and doing so publically. A death to systemic [[racism]] is just the same as a death to climate change. It is no one person's fault that it has gotten this and bad, and we all need to work together in order to change the system that caused it. Declaring it a public crisis would also make valuable resources like money and national services available as quickly as possible.\n\n\n**[[Black Identity Development|Ritchey (2014) -- Black Identity Development]]**\n\n3. Choose a character from a movie, TV show, or video game that you enjoy who may have gone through some of the stages of identity development from Cross's Nigrescence model (keep in mind that Cross believed his model should only be applied to African [[America|Americans]], not people of other racial identities). In your answer, briefly explain the character and then give examples showing their experience at two stages of the model (be sure to explain why the example is indicative of that stage). **(5 pts)**\n\n\t- While the movie *Moonlight* does not directly approach racial issues, I do believe stages of the [[Black Identity model]] can be seen. The reason that black identity development is obvious at first glance in *Moonlight* is because Nigrescence model is primarily focused of [[black people]]'s experience of [[racism]] perpetrated by white people, and *Moonlight* mainly takes place majority BIPOC and because the main character Chiron's identity journey is related to him being [[Queer|gay]] and not him being black. However, the homophobia Chiron experiences in *Moonlight* and the [[racism]] required for the Nigrescence model are linked. Despite the fact that the majority of homophobia Chiron experience is from other [[black people]], he is forced to submit to their model of masculinity because the alternative is facing the [[racism]] of white people. Two major encounters for Chiron are when he is beat and bullied for the effeminate way that he walks and acts as a child. The ultra-masculine archetype that his peers are trying to force on him is no doubt related to the way [[black people]] have been persecuted in society. The other encounter is when one of Chiron's only positive influences communicates to him the importance of a strong black identity and intrinsic masculinity in that. These encounters push Chiron to shed his effeminate nature and pursue being a stereotypical masculine black man. I believe this phase in example of the Immersion-Emersion phase, Chiron is internalizing holding onto a negative black stereotype he is engaging positively with being black in other ways. However, I don't think he moves onto the Internalization stage until many years later, when he finally comes to terms with being [[Queer|gay]] and is able to embrace [[self-love]] now that he has shed that negative stereotype of masculinity.\n\n\n**[[articles_None_Urn|Cook & McCoy (2020) -- Messages in Collusion]]**\n\n4. In class and in the lecture about White Identity Development, we discussed Helms's White Racial Identity Development Model. Using this information as well as information from the article, identify comments, statements, and/or behaviors made by the RAs in the study that display one of Helms's stages of development. Be sure to say what stage you are discussing and explain why the comment/behavior fits that stage. **(3 pts)**\n\t- Lots of the responses to the \"[[Racism]] Continues to Exist vs. Things are Better for People of Color\" message, fit into the first stage of White Identity model, contact. Despite being in positions of power as RA's they were not aware of [[racism]] around them and generally employed a color-blind strategy of leadership, even saying they didn't realize \"that race really was a potent factor in American interactions today.\" Responses from the \"Colorblind is Wrong vs. Colorblind is the Goal\" and the \"Segregation vs. Inclusion\" messages fit well into the Disintegration step, as these two messages brought a lot of feelings of confusion and shock from the RA's because of ideals that they had been taught were non-racist or even anti-racist were being shown in a different light. This is primarily because of a misunderstanding of what anti-[[racism]] actually looks at at, a pattern of white people being too fragile to do the work that will actually combat [[racism]]. Response from the \"White People need to Learn from Other White People vs. White People Can Only Learn from People of Color\" show how most of the RA's did not really make it past Disintegration. When left to their all-White affinity group and away from the contact of People of Color, they did not have productive discussions. They weren't able to take personal ownership of [[racism]]. One could get that some of the RA's will fall in the Reintegration step after this study, whether that be because they choose to or do simply by not continuing the work to progress to the later stages. \n\n**Robbins & McGowan (2016) -- Intersectional Perspectives on [[Gender]]**\n\n5. On pp. 77-78, the authors provide examples from research about why [[intersectionality]] is important in understanding the experiences of participants. Choose one of these examples and summarize it in your own words. Then, explain why [[intersectionality]] was a necessary component of the research (i.e., why just investigating race <u>or</u> [[gender]] wouldn't have allowed the researchers to obtain these findings). **(3 pts)**\n\t- In Brian's research he looked at the \"The Gendered Realities of African American Cisgender Men\" which was prompted by the lack of research in this area compared with white cisgender men. What he found was a close connection of African American's [[gender]] with their race and sexuality. This would not have been highlighted in previous research had not been looked at in an intersectional manner.\n\n**McCormick-Huhn et al. (2019) -- What If Psychology Took [[Intersectionality]] Seriously?**\n\n6. In this article, the authors consider the role of [[intersectionality]] in understanding and assess research participants specifically. In their discussion, they propose four *perspective shifts* that will allow researchers to better conceptualize participants. Choose <u>two</u> of these perspective shifts, explain what they are referring to, and state why it is important for research psychologists to consider. Write in your own words. **(6 pts)**\n\t- **Participant's systemic advantage or disadvantage**: Similar outcomes in different groups may have separate causes, and similar may have different determining causes in different groups. Just because a white man and black man are tall does not mean they are perceived the same way by society. You have to consider their other intersectional groups that may influence how the shared factors of tall and man are interpreted. This is important because it leads to more accurate conclusions about why certain things are happenings.\n\t- **Participants’ Social Group Memberships Are Dynamic**: The way that a participant's intersectional identity affects whatever is being studied is likely to change based of the context of their social group's position and their position in relation to other social groups. For example, a [[transgender]] black person's perception of race may be influenced by race's connection to [[gender]] in a way that is different from a cisgender black person. Though they are both part of the same social group, their perception of it is different based on other identities.","date modified":"Sunday, September 26th 2021, 4:10:41 pm","degree":2,"nameLength":11},"position":{"x":985.2558406102154,"y":606.6552310492933},"group":"nodes","removed":false,"selected":true,"selectable":true,"locked":false,"grabbable":true,"pannable":false,"classes":"note filtered"},{"data":{"id":"core:0 That's Gender Dysphoria, FYI.md","name":"0 That's Gender Dysphoria, FYI","path":"00_Meta/Primary Sources/gender-dysphoria-bible/0 That's Gender Dysphoria, FYI.md","content":"---\ncreated: 2021-05-10T18:22:56 (UTC -05:00)\ntags: []\nsource: https://genderdysphoria.fyi/\nauthor: Jocelyn Badgley\n---\n\n- [[Gender has historically been non-binary]] [^1]\n\n\n\n\n[^1]: For as long as human civilization has existed, [there have been people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_history) whose experience of their internal [[gender]] does not align with the physical features of their body.

Even the word “[[transgender]]” only dates back to 1965, when John Oliven proposed it as a more accurate alternative to David Cauldwell’s term “transsexual” (coined in 1949), which itself replaced Magnus Hirschfield’s term “transvestite” (1910).\n\n- [[Def]] To be [[transgender]] is to have a [[gender]] [[self]] which does not match the [[gender]] you were presumed to have based on the genitalia you were born with. \n\t- This can mean a person born with a penis is actually a girl, that a person born with a vulva is actually a boy, or that a person with either genital configuration may not wholly fit either side of that spectrum and is [[non-binary]].\n\n[[You can discover your transness at any point in life]]==A [[transition]] person can come to recognize this at _any point_ in their life.== [[No]] ==Some children identify it at as soon as they are able to grasp the concept of the differences between the sexes, others don’t start to feel anything until the onset of puberty==, and [[Yes]] ==still others do not realize that anything is wrong at all until they are fully adults==. Many people are simply never exposed to the idea that their [[gender]] could mismatch their birth sex, or what that feels like, and thus simply accepted their fate.\n\n[[Any experience of gender dysphoria is acceptable]] Even more common is a [[perception]] that even though they have feelings about being unhappy with the [[gender]] they were assigned at birth, they believe that this is not the same as what [[transgender]] people experience. Some may feel that a wish to be [[transgender]] and have [[transgender]] available is some kind of disrespect towards “real” [[transgender|trans]] people who knew they were actually boys or girls “born in the wrong body.” ==These narratives of the [[transgender]] experience that have been spread by popular [[media]] create a **very false impression** of just what it means to be [[transition]] and what growing up [[transgender]] feels like.==\n\n[[Gender Dysphoria is based in a intrinsic wrongness of self]] ==This experience of discontinuity between the internal and external [[self]] is what we describe as [[gender dysphoria]]==. Every [[transgender|trans]] person, regardless of their position within or outside of the [[gender]] binary, experiences some form of [[Gender Dysphoria]]. This is something of a political topic within [[transgender|trans]] communities, as different groups have their own ideas of what [[Gender Dysphoria]] is, how it manifests itself, and what qualifies a person as being [[transgender|trans]]. By and large, however, this debate is feckless and fruitless, as the definition at the top of this page encompasses the beginning and the ending of how these terms intermingle.\n\nThe [[purpose]] of this site is to document the many ways that [[gender dysphoria]] can manifest, as well as other aspects of [[gender]] [[transgender]], in order to provide a guide for those who are questioning, those who are starting their [[transgender]] journey, those already on their path, and those who simply wish to be better allies.\n","created":"2021-05-10T18:22:56 (UTC -05:00)","tags":[],"source":"https://genderdysphoria.fyi/","author":"Jocelyn Badgley","degree":10,"nameLength":30},"position":{"x":773.9136307556655,"y":390.36811268752524},"group":"nodes","removed":false,"selected":true,"selectable":true,"locked":false,"grabbable":true,"pannable":false,"classes":"note filtered"},{"data":{"id":"core:10 Existential Euphoria.md","name":"10 Existential Euphoria","path":"00_Meta/Primary Sources/gender-dysphoria-bible/10 Existential Euphoria.md","content":"---\ncreated: 2021-05-10T18:22:56 (UTC -05:00)\ntags: []\nsource: https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/existential-dysphoria\nauthor: Jocelyn Badgley\n---\n\n# How Gender Dysphoria Manifests: Existential Dysphoria :: That's Gender Dysphoria, FYI\n\n> ## Excerpt\n> I don't regret the things I have done, I regret the things I didn't do when I had the chance.\n\n---\n**The [[Gender Dysphoria]] Bible is a Living Document**\n\nThe contents of this site will change over time as new additions and revisions are made to further expand upon the full breadth of [[Gender Dysphoria]].

Sleepovers, camping trips, girl/boy scouts, shopping trips, cheerleading or sports. Events that are co-ed may have very different feelings attached to them based on how you engage with them, like going to prom, religious ceremonies (such as having a bat mitzvah instead of a bar mitzvah), and even just the act of courtship. This dysphoria may also be biological in origin, such as a sorrow over having not given birth to or breastfed your children.\n\nThese missed opportunities can manifest as feelings of loss and hurt. Furthermore, the memories of things you _did_ have access to but wouldn’t have otherwise, or events that were performed in the wrong [[gender]], can also be a sour point, as these may have awkward attachments. Imagine having to be a groom at your wedding when you know you should have been a bride; growing up dreaming about your perfect wedding, and then playing the wrong role in it.\n\n[[Yes]] ==Sometimes existential dysphoria can manifest existentially, hitting you with all the grief of the youth lost.== All the dating, the teenage antics, the parties, even just having been able to be sexual with the correct parts while your body was young and you had no responsibilities. It is time that can never be gained back.\n\nMany [[transgender|trans]] people attempt to recapture some of these lost events, hosting or attending [[Queer]] proms, organizing sleepovers, performing vow renewals with their spouses, and engaging in common puberty rites of passage like having a mother figure help them shop for their first bra, or having a father figure teach them to shave. However, ultimately, existential dysphoria is something that can never be relieved. You can make new experiences to replace the ones you lost, but you can never turn back the clock.\n\nThis is one of many reasons why affirming [[transgender|trans]] youth is so important. Boys want to do common boy things, girls want to do common girl things, and [[non-binary]] children want to do whatever feels correct to them, and when they miss out they will not forget.\n","created":"2021-05-10T18:22:56 (UTC -05:00)","tags":[],"source":"https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/existential-dysphoria","author":"Jocelyn Badgley","degree":4,"nameLength":23},"position":{"x":733.1373547620168,"y":364.43814191507835},"group":"nodes","removed":false,"selected":true,"selectable":true,"locked":false,"grabbable":true,"pannable":false,"classes":"note filtered"},{"data":{"id":"core:11 Managed Dysphoria Gender in Disguise.md","name":"11 Managed Dysphoria Gender in Disguise","path":"00_Meta/Primary Sources/gender-dysphoria-bible/11 Managed Dysphoria Gender in Disguise.md","content":"---\ncreated: 2021-05-10T18:22:56 (UTC -05:00)\ntags: []\nsource: https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/managed-dysphoria\nauthor: Jocelyn Badgley\n---\n\n# Managed Dysphoria: Gender in Disguise :: That's Gender Dysphoria, FYI\n\n> ## Excerpt\n> I don't regret the things I have done, I regret the things I didn't do when I had the chance.\n\n---\n**The [[Gender Dysphoria]] Bible is a Living Document**\n\nThe contents of this site will change over time as new additions and revisions are made to further expand upon the full breadth of [[Gender Dysphoria]].

The following are ways a closeted [[transgender|trans]] person may find to alleviate the dysphoria they experience in their day to day lives:\n\n-   [[No]] ==When a video game gives you the option of choosing your [[gender]], you tend to choose differently than your assigned [[gender]].== This may be accompanied with excuses to defend that choice. “It defaulted to male and I didn’t care.” “I don’t want to stare at a guy’s butt for hours.”\n\n-   [[No]] ==A preference for literature and film with characters of your true [[gender]], or with characters who break [[gender]] norms (Mulan, Little [[Women]]).==\n\n-   [[No]] ==Pornographic outlets which satisfy strong desires or feel more relatable, such as a draw towards gay/lesbian porn, bridal kink, or transformation sequences.==\n\n-   [[No]] ==Crossdressing or performing drag.==\n\n-   [[No]] ==Finding excuses to cut hair short, or to grow it out.==\n\n-   [[Sometimes]] ==Shaving of body hair, or a refusal to shave hair you’re expected to.==\n\n-   [[No]] ==Wearing loose and baggy clothing that hides the shape of your body.==\n\n-   [[Sometimes]] ==Avoiding social gatherings whenever possible, seeking isolation.==\n\n-   [[No]] ==Becoming intimately educated about some [[gender]]-associated topic, such as men’s or [[women]]’s clothing design.==\n\n-   Obsessively working out (AFABs).\n\n-   [[Yes]] ==Helping cis partners to shop in order to live vicariously through their presentation.==\n\n\n[You're worried that you might be homophobic, even though you believe in [[gay rights]], because \"LGBT+ stuff\" fills you with a deep discomfort.

We receive tons and tons of subliminal messages through out our lives saying that being [[transgender|trans]] isn’t normal and that anyone who is has to be exceptionally special. Cis [[media]]’s obsession with the “born in the wrong body” narrative has led to a lot of false information being internalized by [[transgender|trans]] youth. ==Many, _many_ [[transgender|trans]] kids grow up thinking they aren’t actually [[transgender|trans]] because they don’t _know_ that they are a different [[gender]], they just wish they were.== Many [[non-binary]] children grow up knowing something is wrong, but not believing they’re [[transgender|trans]] because they don’t feel like a binary [[transgender|trans]] person.\n\nOn top of this, messages saying that [[transgender|trans]] people hate their bodies or hate their genitalia have polluted the awareness landscape, so that many people who either do not experience physical dysphoria (or simply think theirs isn’t very strong) go around believing they aren’t “[[transgender|trans]] enough”.\n\n[[TO/EXPLORE/READ]]  _**[YES, YOU ARE [[transgender|TRANS]] ENOUGH](https://www.amazon.com/Yes-You-Are-[[transgender|Trans]]-Enough/dp/1785923153/)**_\n\n[Gay people 2 decades ago: \\*exist\\*\n](https://twitter.com/RoseOfWindsong/status/1221970265862811650)\n\nBigots: \"They're trying to turn our children [[Queer|gay]]!

This creates a lot of [[self]] doubt about the authenticity of one’s [[gender]], especially in the face of so many [[gender]] stereotypes. Seeing oneself fail to meet those stereotypes can make it very easy to convince yourself that you do not live up to your own [[gender]] (note: cis men and [[women]] get this too, far too often).\n\nFurthermore, due to a history of transphobic abuse, many [[transgender|trans]] people suffer from damaged [[self]]-esteems, and often already have difficulty with [[self]] doubts. [[gender dysphoria]] also causes [[depression]], which further contributes to and reinforces those doubts. This all leads into a massive cluster of [[self]] invalidation that can lead someone to struggle over and over again to accept their own [[gender identity]].\n\n==But here’s the thing… only [[transgender|trans]] people are worried about if they are actually [[transgender]]!== A cisgender person does not have this obsession with their [[self]], they think about it, they process it, they move on.

That lingerie that you bought specifically to feel sexy in?\n](https://twitter.com/TwippingVanilla/status/1153300372468801536)\n\nYes, that triggers it. All it means is thst you’re happy.\n\n[Let me tell you, the massive relief my friend displayed at learning that this was completely normal was palpable. The poor girl had been stressing about that so hard.\n](https://twitter.com/TwippingVanilla/status/1153300374133981186)\n\nShe didn’t even know about AGP, but she knew the stigmas and was terrified that this meant she was fake.\n\nThis pattern was strongly reinforced during the late 1980s when the Autogynephelia (AGP) theory of Ray Blanchard gained a lot of traction as [[transgender|trans]] awareness was just starting to escalate. AGP is a pseudo-scientific explanation intended to “explain” the source of [[transgender|trans]] [[women]]’s identities using [paraphilias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphilia). Blanchard separated [[transgender|trans]] [[women]] according to if they were attracted to men or to [[women]], while simultaneously invalidating their womanhood. His work completely ignored [[transgender]] men, and he dismisses [[non-binary]] identities outright.\n\nAutogynephelia attests that straight [[transgender|trans]] [[women]] are actually just [[Queer|gay]] men who seek a feminine appearance to draw [[desire]] from straight men, and that [[transgender|trans]] lesbians are actually straight men who have become so obsessed with their [[desire]] for [[women]] that they wish to become a woman in order to gain sexual gratification from themselves.\n\nBlanchard’s theory largely hinged on the way that presenting feminine often resulted in sexual arousal within newly transitioning [[women]]. You see, most of his study subjects were patients who were trying to seek hormone therapy for the first time, and as such were still very new to presenting female.\n\nYes, it boggles the mind, but this was actually considered a valid theory of psychology for years. It even appeared in college textbooks. Blanchard’s research studies did not meet scientific rigor, and his data was found to be extremely flawed (he manipulated his patients, and simply just threw out any data that didn’t fit his hypothesis). A lot of his theories are based in misogynistic views of womanhood, and the man never actually involved any cisgender [[women]] in his study to function as a control group. You can read more about how flawed the theory is in Julia Serano’s excellent essay [The Case Against Autogynephilia](https://www.juliaserano.com/av/Serano-CaseAgainstAutogynephilia.pdf).\n\nAGP had been thoroughly dismissed by modern psychology by the late 2000s, but the damage has been done. In the public’s eye, [[transgender|trans]] [[women]] were all perverted fetishists. [[Media]] portrayals of [[transgender|trans]] [[women]] mirrored this attitude, further spreading negative imagery into the public [[conscious|consciousness]].\n\nTransfeminine individuals then internalize these messages, and come to the conclusion that they are not actually [[transgender]], just fetishists. It happened to me, it’s happened to nearly every millennial [[transgender|trans]] woman I know who figured themselves out as a teen.\n\n==You are not a fetishist, the feeling you get from thinking of yourself as a woman is [[Gender Euphoria]].==\n\n### Patriarchal Oppression \nA common source of invalidation for AFABs is the conflation of [[gender]] with the systemic oppression of [[women]], particularly among non-medically-transitioning [[non-binary]] people. The message of “oh you just don’t want to be a woman because of how [[women]] are treated” is far too often heard, and it can deeply infest your [[subconscious]] to the point of [[self]] doubt. But this doesn’t make much sense, because if you’re AFAB and not a woman, that makes you [[transgender]]. And on average, society treats [[transgender]] folks worse than [[women]]. So transitioning to escape systemic oppression is a dumb concept (and I personally have never met a [[transgender|trans]] person who has done this).\n\nRadical Feminism’s messaging of abandoning female [[gender]] roles can also make parsing your own feelings harder. “Am I actually [[non-binary]], or am I just a feminist?” “Am I actually a man, or am I just a very butch [[Queer|lesbian]]?”. For this, I encourage you to talk to cis woman feminists, especially lesbians. They’ll complain about systems of oppression and the patriarchy, but the problems are all external, and they _want to be women_. Even very butch lesbians want to be [[women]], just in a different way from mainstream femininity.\n\nThen you have the problem of people believing that to be [[non-binary]] is to be androgynous, and to be androgynous is to be less feminine. Feminine enbies are valid! It is okay if you do not want to remove your breasts. It is okay if you enjoy your curves. It is okay if you do not mind being called “she” and “her”. That does not make you any less [[transgender]].\n\nIf you feel like you are not a binary woman, than you are not a binary woman. Cis [[women]] do not experience that detachment.\n\n### Toxic Masculinity \nMale-assigned kids grow up positively drenched in messaging of what it is to “be a man”. There are so few examples of positive masculinity in popular [[media]], and AMAB Masculine Enbies are also so commonly erased in [[transgender|trans]] representation that being a genderqueer male can feel very lonely. [[Yes]] ==AMAB Enbies are often either grouped in with [[Queer|gay]] cis men or treated like [[transgender|trans]] [[women]].==\n\nYou can just be genderqueer! Your [[self]] is valid!\n\n### Transmedicalism \nThis one hits _everybody_. Transmedicalism (aka Truetrans) is a [[transgender]] ideology derived from the Harry Benjamin scale (ranks 5 and 6). It seeks to reinforce the pre-WPATH rules, requiring intense physical dysphoria, demanding medical transition, and often invalidating all [[non-binary]] identities. At its core, transmedicalism is a supremacist concept, elevating binary [[transgender|trans]] people above the needs of any other [[gender identity]], and a push back against the expansion of the [[transgender]] [[self]]. They wish for more gatekeeping than we have today, rail against enbies using the [[transgender]] label, and would prefer to see fewer people receive treatment for their [[gender dysphoria]].\n\nTo put it succinctly, many transmedicalists hate that the newer generation “has it so easy,” despite the fact that many of their ranks are part of that generation. This ideology started among disgruntled [[transgender|trans]] elders, but has since spread to other binary individuals, particularly among young [[transgender|trans]] men.\n\nIf a [[transgender|trans]] person’s first exposure to transness is a transmedicalist, this can severely set back their own [[self]]-acceptance and push them even further into the closet. Transmeds are well known to actually tell people “No, you are not [[transgender|trans]].”\n\n**Do not believe these lies.** They are bully tactics explicitly designed to gaslight and dismiss people’s pain for [[self]] gratification.\n\n### Trans-Exclusionary Reactionary Feminism / Gender Critical Movement / Gender Essentialism \n[Gender Essentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_essentialism) is the belief that there are an innate attributes to a person’s existence that are derived based on what sex organs the person is born with. TERF and GC ideology was born out of the [[Queer|lesbian]] separatist movement of second wave feminism and fully denies the existence of [[transgender]] biology and [[non-binary]] identities. The movement has been largely overtaken by right-wing reactionaries, racists, and homophobes, and is now being bolstered by evangelical [[Christianity|Christian]] organizations.\n\nThese people will stop at nothing to invalidate your existence. Do not give them the time of day.\n\n### Gender Abolitionism / Postgenderism \n[Postgenderism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgenderism) is a [transhumanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism) [[philosophy]] originating in radical feminism which states that [[gender]] causes more harm than good, and seeks to eradicate it from our society. GAs believe that all [[gender]] is a construct and that anyone who feels strongly connected to a binary [[gender]] is either nefariously propagating [[gender]] stereotypes or ignorantly following systemic [[indoctrination]].\n\nGAs do not believe in the existence of [[gender dysphoria]], and will attempt to invalidate those who experience it. They’re functionally the extreme leftist version of the [[Gender]] Critical movement.\n","created":"2021-05-10T18:22:56 (UTC -05:00)","tags":[],"source":"https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/impostor-syndrome","author":"Jocelyn Badgley","degree":7,"nameLength":39},"position":{"x":895.3590905143903,"y":420.2630683794015},"group":"nodes","removed":false,"selected":true,"selectable":true,"locked":false,"grabbable":true,"pannable":false,"classes":"note filtered"},{"data":{"id":"core:13 Diagnosing Gender Dysphoria.md","name":"13 Diagnosing Gender Dysphoria","path":"00_Meta/Primary Sources/gender-dysphoria-bible/13 Diagnosing Gender Dysphoria.md","content":"---\ncreated: 2021-05-10T18:22:56 (UTC -05:00)\ntags: []\nsource: https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/diagnoses\nauthor: Jocelyn Badgley\n---\n\n# Diagnosing Gender Dysphoria :: That's Gender Dysphoria, FYI\n\n> ## Excerpt\n> It's clinical.\n\n---\n**The [[Gender Dysphoria]] Bible is a Living Document**\n\nThe contents of this site will change over time as new additions and revisions are made to further expand upon the full breadth of [[Gender Dysphoria]].

The GDB is an open source and publicly funded project, [content](https://github.com/GenderDysphoria/GenderDysphoria.fyi) and [fiscal](https://patreon.com/curvyandtrans) contributions are extremely welcome.\n\nThis section is going to focus on the diagnostic criteria under the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of [[mental disorders]], version five (DSM-5). The reason I’m focusing on this standard is because, well, nobody else has one. The [[Britain|UK]]’s National Health Service basically mirrors the APA’s DSM. Other countries have their own local standards, but they’re all either very similar, or a lot more outdated.\n\nThe WPATH SoC describes ways that [[Gender Dysphoria]] manifests, but does not define clear diagnostic criteria, instead leaving it up to individual [[mental health]] professionals to make their own diagnoses. In general it advocates that if the [[patient]] is of sound mind and body and says that they have [[Gender Dysphoria]], then they should be believed. The key piece here is “sound mind and body”, it is left to the [[mental health]] professional to do the due diligence to ensure that there are no other conditions which may be causing the [[patient]] to believe this.\n\nOr to put it bluntly, WPATH says that if you think you’re [[transgender|trans]], you’re [[transgender|trans]]. This has been the attitude that the majority of the community has adopted as well. As long as you believe your [[gender]] does not match what you were assigned at birth, you are [[transgender]]. However, insurance companies aren’t so happy with [[self]]-diagnoses, so here are the criteria which are defined in DSM-5 for diagnosing someone with [[Gender Dysphoria]].\n\n#### For Your Information\n\nDiagnosis of [[gender dysphoria]] in prepubescent children requires the child must have a documented six month history of meeting six of these criteria, as well as demonstrated distress or impairment in function.\n\n1.  A strong [[desire]] to be of the other [[gender]] or an insistence that one is the other [[gender]]\n2.  A strong preference for wearing clothes typical of the opposite [[gender]]\n3.  A strong preference for cross-[[gender]] roles in make-believe play or fantasy play\n4.  A strong preference for the toys, games or activities stereotypically used or engaged in by the other [[gender]]\n5.  A strong preference for playmates of the other [[gender]]\n6.  A strong rejection of toys, games and activities typical of one’s assigned [[gender]]\n7.  A strong dislike of one’s sexual anatomy\n8.  A strong [[desire]] for the physical sex characteristics that match one’s experienced [[gender]]\n\n**Note** These are the criteria for adolescents and adults. Children have a different set of criteria, which [you can find here](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-[[gender]]-dysphoria). I have also changed the wording slightly, here, as the official criteria are binary-centric.\n\nFor an adult to be diagnosed with [[gender dysphoria]] by a licensed [[mental health]] professional they must meet two of these six criteria, and have experienced those criteria for longer than six months.\n\n-   [[No]] ==**A marked incongruence between one’s experienced/expressed [[gender]] and primary and/or secondary sex characteristics**==\n\n    The way the person sees the world and interacts with the world does not align with the way it is typically expected for someone of the [[gender]] they were assigned at birth. There are a very broad number of traits which fit into this description. It can be in the way they interact with others, how they talk, what hobbies they prefer, how they dress, their body language and mannerisms, what [[gender]](s) they relate to more.\n\n-   [[Yes]] ==**A strong [[desire]] to be rid of one’s primary and/or secondary sex characteristics**==\n\n-   [[Yes]] ==**A strong [[desire]] for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of another [[gender]]**==\n\n    These two are pretty well paired. This is physical dysphoria as previously defined. The person finds discomfort with aspects of their body which are a result of their sex at birth.\n\n-   [[Yes]] ==**A strong [[desire]] to be of another [[gender]]**==\n\n-   [[Yes]] ==**A strong [[desire]] to be treated as another [[gender]]**==\n\n    These are the social and societal dysphoria. They are how a person wants to interact with the world, and wants the world to interact with them.\n\n-   [[Sometimes]] ==**A strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions of another [[gender]]**==\n\n    This is pretty [[self]] explanatory.\n\n\nAs I said, only two of these conditions need be met for a formal diagnosis. You may notice that only two of these comprise the physical body. It is perfectly valid for a [[transgender|trans]] person to be experiencing [[Gender Dysphoria]] without actually hating any part of their body, or wanting to change any part of their body. Physical Dysphoria is only one fraction of the many ways that lead to being [[transgender|trans]].\n\nNow, here is the kicker. If you identify as [[transgender]], meaning that your [[gender]] does not align with the binary sex you were assigned at birth, you already meet two of these criteria! You have a strong enough [[desire]] to be of another [[gender]] that you are identifying that you _are_ another [[gender]], and you have a strong conviction of what your [[gender]] feels like, and it isn’t what you were given at birth.\n\nSo, it is literally impossible for a person to identify as [[transgender|trans]] and not experience [[gender dysphoria]]. By the WPATH requirements anyone can identify as [[transgender|trans]]. Ergo, the statement “you do not have to have dysphoria to be [[transgender]]” is a logical paradox.\n\nThen why do we still say it? Because most people don’t know what [[gender dysphoria]] actually is, and it is easier to repeat the mantra than to explain the nuances and subtleties of how [[Gender Dysphoria]] manifests. But hey, look, now you’ve got a nice article to link to that can help people understand that.\n","created":"2021-05-10T18:22:56 (UTC -05:00)","tags":[],"source":"https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/diagnoses","author":"Jocelyn Badgley","degree":8,"nameLength":30},"position":{"x":875.437608468492,"y":206.1420146253488},"group":"nodes","removed":false,"selected":true,"selectable":true,"locked":false,"grabbable":true,"pannable":false,"classes":"note filtered"},{"data":{"id":"core:14 Treating Gender Dysphoria.md","name":"14 Treating Gender Dysphoria","path":"00_Meta/Primary Sources/gender-dysphoria-bible/14 Treating Gender Dysphoria.md","content":"---\ncreated: 2021-05-10T18:22:56 (UTC -05:00)\ntags: []\nsource: https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/treatment\nauthor: Jocelyn Badgley\n---\n\n# Treating Gender Dysphoria :: That's Gender Dysphoria, FYI\n\n> ## Excerpt\n> Transition is the cure.\n\n---\n**The [[Gender Dysphoria]] Bible is a Living Document**\n\nThe contents of this site will change over time as new additions and revisions are made to further expand upon the full breadth of [[Gender Dysphoria]].

The GDB is an open source and publicly funded project, [content](https://github.com/GenderDysphoria/GenderDysphoria.fyi) and [fiscal](https://patreon.com/curvyandtrans) contributions are extremely welcome.\n\nTreatment options vary significantly depending on the individual person’s needs. Every single transition is unique, and there is no one way to transition. This section is a list of possible pathways.\n\nIn a phrase: Coming out of the closet. This is simply announcing to the world that you are [[transgender]]. You announce that you wish to use a new name and/or new pronouns – or not, you may just wish for people to know that you are [[transgender|trans]] and do not actually identify with your assigned binary [[gender]]. For some [[non-binary]] people this may not even be a full step away from their assignment, since [[gender]] is a spectrum and there is such as thing as a “[[non-binary]] man” and a “[[non-binary]] woman”.\n\nA social transition is the act of stepping out of the closet, and it can relieve a lot of stress from suppression of ones [[self]].\n\n### Legal Transition \nThis is the process of changing your legal documents to reflect your true [[gender]]. This may be through a legal name and [[gender]] change issued by a court, through a change of [[gender]] marker on an official ID, or through re-issuing of birth certificates and marriage licenses.\n\n### Presentational Transition \nThese are changes to how you style yourself, be it your clothes, your hair, or the use of makeup. Our society heavily genders all of these things, and switching presentation is both affirming to one’s [[self]] and also sends cues to those around them about how they wish to be addressed.\n\n### Medical Transition \nFor adults this is hormone replacement therapy and surgery. For adolescents this often means puberty blockers until the teen is old enough to be certain of which gonadal hormone they want to have. For prepubescents, this is nothing. Let me repeat that again, since transphobes keep getting it wrong.\n\n_**PREPUBESCENT CHILDREN DO NOT MEDICALLY TRANSITION**_.\n\nWhile the American Academy of Pediatrics [strongly encourages the validation and acceptance of [[transgender]] youth](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/early/2018/09/13/peds.2018-2162.full.pdf), and the enabling of all other forms of transition, they explicitly do not support doctors beginning either hormone therapy or puberty blockers until a child has reached [Tanner stage 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanner_scale).\n\nFurthermore, no surgeon in [[America|the United States]] will perform a [[gender]] altering surgery on a minor (excluding intersex “corrections”, which is a whole other problem outside the scope of this article). Very few children have strong enough features to be read as either male or female without clues provided through presentation. Allowing a child to change their hair and clothes is all that is needed for the child to be seen as male or female.\n\n### Hormonal Transition \n\n**Masculinizing Hormone Therapy** (female to male sexual characteristics) consists of the introduction of testosterone, usually via intramuscular injection or topical gel. The increase in total gonadal hormones typically causes a cessation of ovulation, which is the source of the majority of estrogen produced in the ovaries.\n\n**Femininizing Hormone Therapy** (male to female sexual characteristics) consists of the introduction of estrogen, typically estradiol, via oral pills, patches, or regular injections (intramuscular or subcutaneous). The use of slow dispensing implants is also becoming more and more common. It is also common practice to prescribe an anti-androgen to block testosterone production or absorption. In [[America|the United States]] this is usually Spironolactone, a blood pressure medication which has a testosterone blocking side-effect. Outside of [[America|the US]] the most common drug is Cyproterone Acetate, an androgen receptor blocker, which is not available in [[America|the US]]. Doctors may also prescribe Bicalutamide, which also blocks androgen receptors. However, some doctors may simply opt to use larger estradiol doses in order to cause the body to halt testosterone production.\n\n**In adolescents**, puberty blockers may involve the above androgen blockers, or if it is covered by insurance, the use of an antigonadtropin (drug which blocks the hormones that cause the production of estrogen and androgen) such as leuprolide acetate (a shot delivered every few months) or histrelin acetate (an annual implant).\n\n### Surgical Transition \n[[transgender]] surgeries are typically divided into three separate categories:\n\n**Bottom Surgery** (modifications to genitals).\n\n-   Femininizing:\n\n    -   Orchiectomy (removal of the testicles)\n    -   Scrotectomy (removal of scrotal tissue, following orchiectomy)\n    -   Vaginoplasty (creation of a vaginal cavity)\n    -   Vulvaplasty (creation of a vulva, with or without depth).\n\n#### For Your Information\n\nA newly developing area of bottom surgery is in AMAB [[non-binary]] operations which attempt to perform vaginoplasty _without_ the removal of the penis. This particular surgery is extremely experimental and has been performed less than a dozen times in [[America|the United States]], but the outlook for the future is good.\n\nAn additional option for [[non-binary]] bottom surgery is genital nullification surgery, which aims to completely remove the external genitalia, leaving only a urethral opening.\n\n-   Masculinizing:\n\n    -   Hysterectomy (removal of uterus and cervix)\n    -   Oophorectomy (removal of one or both ovaries)\n    -   Vaginectomy (removal of vaginal cavity)\n    -   Metoidioplasty (a process which increases the size of the clitorus into a penis)\n    -   Phalloplasty (construction of a penis from skin grafting)\n    -   Urethroplasty (extension of the urethral canal through the phallus)\n    -   Scrotoplasty (use of labia majora and false testicles to construct a scrotum).\n\n**Top Surgery** (modifications to the chest)\n\n-   Feminizing:\n\n    -   Breast Augmentation via fat transfer or implants.\n-   Masculinizing:\n\n    -   Bilateral Mastectomy (breast tissue removal) with chest [[reconstruction]].\n\n**Facial Feminization / Masculinization Surgery** (modifications to the skull, cartilage, and skin on the face).\n\nThe younger a person is, the less they will need these surgeries, especially if they medically transition prior to the age of 20.\n\n-   Feminizing:\n\n    -   Forehead recontouring\n    -   Eye socket recontouring\n    -   Brow lift\n    -   Hairline correction\n    -   Blepharoplasty (lifting of eye bags)\n    -   Rhinoplasty (reshaping of the nose)\n    -   Cheek implants\n    -   Lip lift\n    -   Lip filling\n    -   Jaw recontouring\n    -   Tracheal shave (adam’s apple reduction)\n    -   Rhytidectomy (face lift)\n-   Masculinizing:\n\n    -   Forehead augmentation\n    -   Jaw augmentation\n    -   Chin augmentation\n    -   Tracheal augmentation (adam’s apple enlargement)\n\nOther [[transgender|Trans]] Feminine Surgeries:\n\n-   Brazilian Butt Lift. Fat from the belly is transplanted into the butt in order to increase hip to waist ratio.\n-   Voice Feminization Surgery. An incision is performed in the vocal chords in order to permanently raise the pitch.\n-   Cinderella Surgery. Bones in the foot are shortened in order to reduce foot size. EXTREMELY RISKY\n-   Shoulder Reduction. The collar bone is shortened to reduce the width of the shoulders.

Science and modern psychology has proven that it is **not** caused by nurture; no one _becomes_ [[transgender]], [[gender identity]] is congenital, solidifying before we even exit the womb. It also appears to sometimes be hereditary; [[transgender]] [[parents]] have a higher likelihood of having [[transgender]] children, and many times they realize this in reverse. The child comes out to the parent, and that helps the parent realize they can come out as well.\n\nHere is the science that is believed to influence [[gender identity]]. This does not mean that it _defines_ [[gender identity]], nor does it fully encapsulate one’s [[gender]], as so many aspects of [[gender]] are cultural and social. None of this is prescriptive of a person’s [[self]], none of it is cast in stone.\n\nIf you’ve seen Jurassic Park then you may remember this scene:\n\n [![All vertebrate embryos are inherently female anyway. They just require an extra hormone given at the right developmental stage to make them male.](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/jurassicpark-8386452ecc.jpeg)](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/jurassicpark-8386452ecc.jpeg) This isn't science fiction, although it is very simplified.\n\nThe gonads in human fetuses initially develop in a bi-potential state, meaning they can become either ovaries or testes. The SRY gene on the Y chromosome releases a protein called [Testis Determining Factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testis-determining_factor) (TDF). This protein then starts a chain reaction with SOX9 production (another protein), which causes the gonadal cells to form into the Sertoli and Leydig cells that make up the testes. If TDF is never produced or is interfered with then the gonad cells form into the Theca cells and Follicles which comprise the ovaries.\n\nOnce formed, the testes then begin producing a testosterone surge which typically starts in the 8th week of gestation and continues until the 24th week. This surge, [combined with another hormone from the placenta](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/02/190214153053.htm), is responsible for the development of the penis and scrotum. Genitalia formation starts around week 9 and becomes identifiable by the 11th week. If the surge does not occur, or the body does not respond to it (such as in the case of Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome) then the genitalia form into the vulva, vagina and uterus instead.\n\nIf there is an interference in this process then you can end up with the wrong bits, and this is the result of many intersex conditions. Often times this is a partial development, where the external genitalia only partially form, but functional gonads still exist. Sometimes the child comes out with fully functional male or female genitalia, but mismatched gonads. Sometimes the TDF protein fails to release and the fetus grows completely functional female reproductive organs, despite the presence of a Y chromosome.\n\nThis is known as Swyer Syndrome, and an unknown number of [[women]] may have this condition. In 2015 [an XY woman with Swyer Syndrome who was born without ovaries](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/mostly-male-woman-gives-birth-to-twins-in-medical-miracle-10033528.html) successfully carried and gave birth to a child via IVF. Usually Swyer Syndrome results in completely non-functional ovaries, but [in 2008 a woman was found with Swyer Syndrome](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2190741/) who had gone through puberty, menstruated normally, and had two unassisted pregnancies. Her condition went undiscovered until her daughter was found to also have it.\n\nThe fact is, the vast majority of the population has never been tested for genetic karyotype, so we don’t know how common these cases actually are. Where does this come into affect for [[gender identity]]? Well, the exact same process that causes the external genitals to differentiate also occurs for the brain.\n\n**And it gets even weirder!**\n\n[[@TransEthics](https://twitter.com/TransEthics) Normally the Y chromosome carries 27 genes, only 4 are related to sex. One, the SRY, determines (via the SOX9 gene) whether testes or ovaries form in the early fetus. Another 3 determine sperm production if testes form.\n](https://twitter.com/LisaTMullin/status/1224039568971710464)\n\n[[@TransEthics](https://twitter.com/TransEthics) The SRY is just a signaler to 3 dark DNA areas to produce more SOX9 genes, above a certain threshold testes form, below that ovaries.\n](https://twitter.com/LisaTMullin/status/1224040716365524993)\n\nBut that is just the start of the story. If ovaries form then another gene, FOXL2, keeps them as ovaries.\n\n[[@TransEthics](https://twitter.com/TransEthics) FOXL2 works with estrogen receptors to keep the ovary as an ovary without which it would turn into testes and start producing testosterone by inhibiting SOX9 production.\n](https://twitter.com/LisaTMullin/status/1224041800513380352)\n\n[[@TransEthics](https://twitter.com/TransEthics) Male and female mammals produce SOX9 as far as I know all their lives (I need to check up on that) and even if there are already ovaries if the level becomes high enough then the ovaries will turn into testes.\n](https://twitter.com/LisaTMullin/status/1224042620164296705)\n\n[[@TransEthics](https://twitter.com/TransEthics) But FOXL2 production depends on enough estrogen and/or the estrogen receptors working correctly. If something goes wrong with either then SOX9 production increases and existing ovaries will turn into testes and produce testosterone.\n](https://twitter.com/LisaTMullin/status/1224043995413639168)\n\n[[@TransEthics](https://twitter.com/TransEthics) So there is a feedback loop: No SRY means less SOX9, thus ovaries form. They produce estrogen which causes FOXL2 production which suppresses SOX9 production to keep the ovaries as ovaries.

The cerebral cortex, the thin outer layer of the brain that contains most of what we think of as [[conscious|consciousness]], grows substantially during those periods of time. Prior to that, the structure present is more like a scaffolding, the basic parts of the nervous system necessary for bodily function. The primary sulci (the wrinkles in the cerebral cortex that allow for more surface area) [start to form at week 14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2989000/[[Sec5title]]), well after the genitals have developed.\n\nIt [has been confirmed multiple times](https://www.the-scientist.com/features/are-the-brains-of-[[transgender]]-people-different-from-those-of-cisgender-people-30027) via MRI studies that there are ==small but significant differences between cis male and cis female brains, differences which align with the [[gender]] identities of [[transgender|trans]] people in the study==. Note, **this does not mean that anyone with those differences will have that [[gender]]**, because [[gender identity]] isn’t that simple, but it provides evidence that there is a clear difference in masculine and feminine brains. [There is also evidence](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/50/15468) that brains can have mosaic combinations of these differences, which may be the case in [[non-binary]] people.\n\nA change in the testosterone levels in the fetus after the 11th week can directly impact the masculinization of the cerebral cortex, as well as changes in other parts of the brain structure. This has been examined [over and over again](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4350266/) in studies of female assigned children with CAH (congenital adrenal hyperplasia) and CAIS (complete androgen insensitivity syndrome).\n\n> We found a significant relationship between fetal testosterone and sexually differentiated play behavior in both girls and boys.\n> \n> — [Fetal Testosterone Predicts Sexually Differentiated Childhood Behavior in Girls and in Boys](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2778233/)\n\nAn excess of testosterone in the mother’s body during the second trimester can (and does) cause masculinization of the brain in an externally female fetus, and an interference in testosterone production or uptake can (and does) cause feminization of the brain in an externally male fetus. This interference does not have to be external in origin, either. Any number of genetic traits can cause the brain to respond differently to testosterone.\n\nA fairly large study of [[transgender]] individuals released in 2018 [found several key genes](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/104/2/390/5104458) which were statistically more likely to be longer among [[transgender|trans]] [[women]] (longer, as in having more repeated fragments). Individually these genes may not have an impact strong enough to cause a malfunction of masculinization, but collectively they absolutely could reduce the ability for the fetal brain to masculinize. These genes are all passed from parent to child, giving credence to a tendency for [[transgender|trans]] [[parents]] to have [[transgender|trans]] children.\n\n#### Gender is Biological \nSadly, western society has actively prevented a deeper understanding of [[gender]]. Ancient civilizations understood it well, but colonialism wiped them off the map. 100 years ago, [scientists in [[Germany]] were actively studying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institut_f%C3%BCr_Sexualwissenschaft) [[transgender]] medicine and made extraordinary advancements, until the Nazis burned it all in 1933. Conservative and fascist pressures in the modern day have hindered advancements in [[transgender]] healthcare whenever possible.\n\nYet, progress continues, and every few years we learn a little bit more.\n\nWhat we know for certain is that it is not a psychological condition, it is not something caused by [[trauma]] or by any external influence, nothing can make a person [[transgender]]. It happens in the womb, and is not something that a person can choose to be, any more than they could choose their race or their eye color. ==It has nothing to do with sexual orientation, it has nothing to do with kinks or fetishes, and it has nothing to do with social influences from their [[parents]] or from their peers==.

Medically these are referred to as DSDs ([Disorders of Sex Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorders_of_sex_development)). Not all result in an intersex condition, and many only manifest at the onset of puberty.\n\n-   [De la Chapelle Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XX_male_syndrome) (46,XX Male) occurs when the SRY gene from the sperm parent crosses over into a non-Y-bearing sperm during spermatogenesis. When the egg and sperm merge, it results in an XX embryo with an SRY gene, creating a phenotypical male child with two X chromosomes.\n\n-   [Swyer Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swyer_syndrome) (46,XY Female) produces a phenotypically female child with an XY chromosome. This results from a dozen different genetic conditions, including:\n\n    -   Absence or defect of an SRY gene\n    -   Absence or defect of [DHH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_hedgehog_(protein)) synthesis\n    -   Absence of the [SF-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroidogenic_factor_1) protein due to adrenal failure\n    -   Absence of or defect the [CBX2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBX2_(gene)) gene, preventing TDF cascade\n-   [XX Gonadal Dysgenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XX_gonadal_dysgenesis) is very similar to Swyer Syndrome, except occurs in XX children and results in nonfunctional ovaries.\n\n-   [Turner Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_syndrome) (45,X) produces a phenotypically female child with numerous abnormalities. It occurs when neither an X or Y chromosome crosses over from the sperm.\n\n-   [Klinefelter Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klinefelter_syndrome) (47,XXY) results in a phenotypically male child with more feminine traits. In extremely rare cases [it appears in female assigned children](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15755052) as well, resulting in feminized testicles instead of ovaries.\n\n-   [49,XXXXY Klinefelter Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/49,XXXXY) is often fatal, but when it isn’t, it will always results in a sterile child.\n\n-   [Trisomy X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_X_syndrome) (47,XXX), [Tetrasomy X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrasomy_X) (48,XXXX), and [Pentasomy X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/49,_XXXXX) (49,XXXXX) all result in a female child, but with progressively more intense health issues.\n\n-   [XXYY Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XXYY_syndrome) results in male children (due to two SRY genes) which often experience hypogonadism, needing testosterone supplements, but otherwise seeming like a typical male\n\n-   [Mosaicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(genetics)) results when some cells in the body have one set of chromosomes and other cells have another due to a mutation of the genome during gestation. This may be XX/XY (resulting in a dual set of genitalia), X/XY (a milder form of Swyer or Turner syndromes) or XX/XXY (a milder form of Klinefelter syndrome).\n\n-   [Chimerism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(genetics)) occurs when two fertilized embryos merge together into one zygote, causing half of the child to contain one set of DNA and the other half to contain another. This can result in an otherwise completely typical human being of either male or female phenotype, even capable of producing offspring, but which comes back on a kareotype test as not matching their phenotype based on where the sample was taken on their body. In extremely rare cases this can result in two full sets of reproductive organs.\n\n-   [Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_adrenal_hyperplasia)(CAH) is masculinization of the female genitals in an XX child due to overactive adrenal glands.\n\n-   [Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_insensitivity_syndrome)(AIS) is a total or partial resistance to all androgens, preventing masculinization of all organs, save for the testicles, in an XY child. AIS subjects typically develop a female [[gender identity]], but some partial cases may be male.\n\n-   [5-alpha-reductase deficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-alpha-reductase_deficiency)(5ARD) is a failure in the body’s ability to metabolize testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), preventing masculinization of the genitalia until the onset of puberty, when the child suddenly grows a penis.\n\n-   [Aromatase Deficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatase_deficiency) causes masculinization of an otherwise female child due to excess levels of testosterone (and can bleed-over into the mother during gestation).\n\n-   [Aromatase Excess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatase_excess_syndrome) causes feminization in an otherwise male child, as all testosterone is converted into estrogen.\n\n\n[Friendly neighborhood biologist here.

That differentiation occurs entirely based on whether you happen to have an SRY gene which, in the 6-8th week of gestation, kicks off a chain reaction that produces testes instead of ovaries. From that point on, every sexual attribute of the human body (primary and secondary) is a result of the hormones that those gonads produce.\n\nIf they produce estrogens (primarily Estradiol) then the genitals form into a vulva, vagina and uterus. If they produce androgens (primarily Testosterone) then the genitals form into a penis and scrotum, shifting the [Skene’s gland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skene%27s_gland) downward and enlarging it into a prostate. Differentiation ends here until the onset of puberty, 9-10 years later, and we all know what puberty does.\n\nSo how does this work? Why do the cells differentiate like this? Well, before we can explain that, first we have to explain the concept of a **Receptor**.\n\n## Hormone Receptors \nIn simplest terms, a receptor is like the keyed lock ignition on a car (do new car’s still have keyed ignitions?). Every cell in the body has a set of locks which activate different functions within that cell. They’re like switches which signal to the cell that it should activate a different part of its genetic sequence. Each receptor can only accept certain chemical compounds, much like how a lock can only accept certain keys, and different chemicals have different capabilities at turning the key. Some can completely start the car, while others only turn it to Accessory Mode.\n\nThe ability for a chemical to fit into a receptor is called **Relational Binding Affinity**, and is measured as percentage of how likely a chemical will bind to a receptor compared to another. So, for example, if Hormone B binds only 10% of the time in relation to Hormone A, then it is said to have a 10% binding affinity. Similarly, the ability for a chemical to turn the key is called _Transactivational Ability_. Compounds which fit into a receptor but don’t do anything are called _Antagonists_, compounds which are able to turn the key are called **Agonists**. If it can only turn the key a tiny bit, it’s called a **Partial Agonist**.\n\nYou can think of antagonists like bouncers at a club. They stand in the doorway and prevent anything else from getting through, but don’t enter the club themselves. Most antagonists are referred to as **blockers**. This is different from an **inhibitor**, which is a compound that slows down a chemical reaction, or an _activator_, which speeds up a reaction. In receptors, an inhibitor lowers the ability of the receptor, causing it to respond less effectively to things that bind to the receptor, and an activator increases the ability of the receptor, making it respond stronger, like a booster.\n\nIn some cases a hormone can function as an inhibitor or an activator for a different hormone by slowing down or increasing behavior in a cell. For example, progesterone increase cell activity, making cells respond more effectively to estrogens and androgens, and testosterone increases the transaction ability of dopamine receptors, so less dopamine is needed in the brain for the same effect.\n\n## Whats in a Hormone \nThere are four main kinds of hormones:\n\n-   [Amino Acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid) such as Melatonin which controls sleep, or Thyroxine which regulates the metabolism.\n-   [Peptides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide_hormone), like Oxytocin and Insulin, which are collections of Amino Acids.\n-   [Eicosanoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eicosanoid) that are formed from lipids and fatty acids and predominantly affect the immune system\n-   [Steroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid) are signaling molecules produced by various internal organs in order to pass messages to other organs within the body.\n\n [![Chart of steroid metabolism flow](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/steroidogenesis-57a6503191.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Steroidogenesis.svg) All steroids are formed from cholesterols (top left) and are derived from other steroids. Progestins form into Androgens which form into Estrogens. This is a one-way exchange, and does not reverse, so don't believe it when someone tells you that too much estrogen will turn it into testosterone.\n\nFor the purposes of transition, this last category is what we care about the most, as all of the sex hormones are steroids. They fall into seven main categories:\n\n-   [Androgens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen)\n-   [Estrogens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen)\n-   [Progestagins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progestogen)\n-   [Glucocorticoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucocorticoid)\n-   [Mineralcorticoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineralocorticoid)\n-   [Neurosteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid)\n-   [Aminosteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aminosteroid)\n\nThe first three of these are what we care about most when it comes to Hormone Therapy. Note: All human beings, regardless of phenotype, have some of every one of these hormones in their bodies. The ratios are what affect body shape.\n\n### Androgens \nThere are nearly a dozen different androgens, but the ones we care about the most are [Testosterone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone) and [Dihydrotestosterone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrotestosterone).\n\nTestosterone is the primary masculinizing hormone for the human body and is produced in the adrenal glands, the testes, and in the ovaries (where it is immediately converted into estrone and estradiol). It tells both muscle and bone cells to grow and in higher concentrations encourages larger muscle mass and thicker skeletal structure. This also means that Testosterone is critical for bone health, as it affects calcium distribution within the skeletal structure. Thus, severe depletion of testosterone can result in osteoperosis and fragile bones. Testosterone also plays a major role in sex drive and libido, encouraging mating behavior within the cerebral cortex.\n\nDihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is converted from Testosterone in the prostate, skin and liver, plays a major role in the development of the male genitalia during puberty by inducing random erections, and the growth of facial and body hair. Paradoxically, DHT is also what causes male pattern baldness, as it chokes off blood circulation to the follicles on the top of the scalp (sorry, [[transgender|trans]] guys, it’s a double edged sword). DHT binds to androgen receptors ten times more strongly than testosterone, which is why it is critical to eliminate it for feminizing transition.\n\n### Estrogens \nThere are four estrogens: [Estradiol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estradiol), [Estrone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrone), Estriol and Estetrol. The latter two are only produced during pregnancy and are important for fetal health, but have no bearing on transition.\n\nEstradiol is the Feminizing hormone, as it is the primary signaling hormone for growth in the mammary glands (breast tissue), and because it encourages fat deposits in the thighs, hips, butt, chest and arms, while discouraging fat deposits in the abdomen, thus producing a curvier figure. Estradiol also promote increased collagen production, resulting in softer skin and more flexible tendons & ligaments.\n\nEstrone’s role in the body has been something of a puzzle in medical research, as it has significantly lower binding affinity compared to estradiol (0.6%) and very low transactivational ability (4%). The hormone doesn’t appear to _do_ anything, it just sits in the blood stream. However it has a unique ability to convert to and from Estradiol via an enzyme group called [17β-HSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17%CE%B2-Hydroxysteroid_dehydrogenase), making it ideally suited to function like an estrogen battery within the body.\n\nNew research is starting to suggest that the body may regulate total estradiol levels by releasing HSD17B1 to turn estradiol into estrone, and releasing HSD17B2 to convert it back, however this is very early study. Both enzymes are produced in breast tissue, and may play a role in the presence of cyclical period-like symptoms in estrogenic individuals who do not have ovaries, such as [[transgender|trans]] [[women]].\n\n#### For Your Information\n\n**Why aren’t AFAB [[transgender|trans]] people prescribed estrogen blockers alongside testosterone?**\n\nThere are two separate sources for estrogens within the female reproductive system. Ovaries contains thousands of follicles, cell structures which produce eggs. The pituitary gland produces luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which encourages the follicles to grow into luteal cells. Theca cells within the follicle produce testosterone, and granulosa cells produce the enzyme [aromatase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatase), which converts that testosterone into estradiol. This is the first source of estrogen, but it is not the largest source.\n\nNote: This is why PCOS causes ovaries to produce testosterone; the ovarian cysts disrupt the aromatase production, so the testosterone does not get converted.\n\nTwo weeks into the period cycle the hypothalamus tells the pituitary gland to produce an LH and FSH spike three to four times stronger than earlier in the cycle. That surge causes the follicles to swell until one pops, releasing an egg, at which point the remains of the follicle become a structure known as the corpus luteum. That corpus luteum then begins to produce progesterone and significantly more estrogens in order to prepare the womb for a fertilized egg. This is the second source.\n\nTaking testosterone causes the hypothalamus to deactivate the genes that initiate this LH and FSH spike, so the follicles never reach maturity, ovulation never occurs, and the corpus luteum is never formed, removing a significant source of estrogen within the ovaries.\n\n_So no, Reddit, it isn’t just “because testosterone is stronger”, it’s because ovaries are a hell of a lot more complex than testes and are easier to disrupt. Please stop spreading this falsehood._\n\n### Progestagins \nThe primary progestogin is [progesterone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progesterone), which plays numerous roles in the body and has been found to be [an important component for feminizing hormone therapy](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/104/4/1181/5270376).\n\nOne of the largest roles that the progestogin receptor plays is in the regulation of gonadal function (ovaries and testies). The hypothalamus is positively _littered_ with progestogin receptors and responds strongly to their activation, downregulating the production of [GnRH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonadotropin-releasing_hormone), which then reduces the production of [luteinizing hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luteinizing_hormone) by the pituitary gland.\n\nLH is what tells the ovaries and testes to produce estrogen and androgens. LH and its sibling hormone [FSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follicle-stimulating_hormone) both play central roles in ovulation, which is another large source of estrogen in ovary-havers. Thus, synthetic progestins, chemicals that fit into progestogin receptors, are often included in birth control in order to prevent ovulation. In AMABs, progestogins are a useful tool for blocking testosterone production.\n\nAnother type of cell that is full of progestogin receptors is mammary tissue. Progesterone plays a major role in the growth and maturation of milk ducts within breast tissue. While little formal research has been conducted into progesterone’s effect on breast development, anecdotally it has been seen widely across the transfem community to provide significant improvements in breast fullness. Progesterone has also been demonstrated to increase blood flow to breast tissue, and encourages fat deposits in the breasts, both of which increase breast size.\n\nAdditionally, progesterone promotes better sleep, improves cardiovascular health, increases ketogenesis (reducing triglycerides), increases metabolic function, and has been found to reduce breast cancer risk.\n\n### Mineralcorticoids \nMineralcorticoids play no role in transition, but they are worth mentioning because of one major hormone: [Aldosterone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldosterone).\n\nAldosterone is what instructs the kidneys to _stop_ extracting water from the blood stream. It is produced by the adrenal glands in order to regulate body hydration. Why is this significant?\n\nBecause one drug that is very commonly used in [[transgender|trans]] hormone therapy is an extremely powerful aldosterone antagonist… Spironolactone. Spiro binds to mineralcorticoid receptors more strongly than aldosterone does, but does not activate the receptor. It just clogs it, preventing the kidneys from receiving the signal to stop extracting water.\n\nThis is why spiro makes people pee so much.\n","created":"2021-05-10T18:22:56 (UTC -05:00)","tags":[],"source":"https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/hormones","author":"Jocelyn Badgley","degree":2,"nameLength":28},"position":{"x":950.3338818825575,"y":676.5209989940249},"group":"nodes","removed":false,"selected":true,"selectable":true,"locked":false,"grabbable":true,"pannable":false,"classes":"note filtered"},{"data":{"id":"core:18 Androgenic Second Puberty 101.md","name":"18 Androgenic Second Puberty 101","path":"00_Meta/Primary Sources/gender-dysphoria-bible/18 Androgenic Second Puberty 101.md","content":"---\ncreated: 2021-05-10T18:22:56 (UTC -05:00)\ntags: []\nsource: https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/second-puberty-masc\nauthor: Jocelyn Badgley\n---\n\n# Androgenic Second Puberty 101 :: That's Gender Dysphoria, FYI\n\n> ## Excerpt\n> What to expect from masculinizing HRT\n\n---\n## What to expect from Masculinizing HRT \nThis is a compilation of reported medical transition changes collected from testimonials of AFAB [[transgender|trans]] people taking testosterone hormone therapy. This information is gathered from social [[media]] and chat rooms. Yes, that means this is all anecdotal, but historically, most of [[transgender]] medical study is anecdotal because no one wants to fund [[transgender]] medical research.\n\n**Note that this is a list of _possible_ changes. There is no guarantee that every person on masculinizing HRT will experience all of these. Your age, genetics, medical history, degree of feminization from natal puberty, and hormone regimen can all have impacts on results. There is also just a degree of randomness – every body is different – and some things can take years to appear.**\n\n### Voice Drop \nAndrogens cause the tissue that comprises the vocal chords to thicken and harden, permanently lowering the pitch of the voice. This is not a very fast change, but rather incremental over the first few years. Some people do not experience any voice change at all, it varies person to person. The change will not be drastic, if you are a soprano you are not going to become a bass, but it could bring you down to a contralto or tenor.\n\nThis does _not_ mean that your voice will automatically become read as male. Pitch is only a piece of how people [[gender]] voice, and the way you speak plays a much larger role. Vocal training will be needed to amplify resonance and change speaking style.\n\n### Changes in Body Temperature Placement \n[[@salenby](https://twitter.com/salenby) [@chaoticgaythey](https://twitter.com/chaoticgaythey) Night sweats/being HOT even at normal room temperature. The night sweats went away after a week or two the being constantly warm has not gone away it has just become normal.\n](https://twitter.com/AFortune69/status/1374039857773875201)\n\nYour scent changes, even the smell of your urine. Like I knew that going in, but it was still weird.\n\nAndrogens encourage extra blood flow to the extremities, making them warmer. Because of this, men have cooler cores but warmer oral and surface level temperatures. You may see your basal body temperature increase. The net result is that you will _feel_ warmer, and likely will not be able to layer clothing as much as previously possible. If you live in cold climates, exposing your calves can help to dissipate heat without chilling you too severely.\n\nThis change often comes fairly early on; expect night sweats while your system gets used to it.\n\n### Changes in Perspiration \nWith the above shift in temperature distribution, this also results in a significant change in how one sweats. Sweat will pool on the head, back and armpits. You’ll also likely sweat more often, so keep water handy.\n\n### Body Odor \nOften one of the first things to change: sweat and general body odor will become much stronger, especially during exercise. The smell will take on a sour, muskier smell. Tends to even out over time.\n\n### Body Hair, Everywhere \nAndrogens significantly increase the presence of body hair on the legs, groin, buttocks, chest, back and arms. Hair will grow in thicker, longer and darker. This will likely happen well before facial hair growth, which can take over a year to start. Rogaine / Monoxidil can help with that, but be careful as it is poisonous if ingested, especially to cats.\n\n### Male Pattern Baldness \nMPD is caused by [Dihydrotestosterone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrotestosterone) (DHT), an androgen which metabolizes from Testosterone. Having more T in your body means more DHT can form, and the gene that contributes to MPD causes the hair follicles on the scalp to receive less blood, choking them out until the follicles die. There will likely be _some_ loss of hair line eventually, no matter what, but if there is a history of baldness among the men in your family, then you can expect to see that as well. Again, Rogaine can help with this.\n\nThe synthetic androgen [Nandrolone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nandrolone) does not metabolize into DHT and may be a viable alternative in place of direct Testosterone if hair loss is a concern. However, DHT is important for genital growth, so this is a double-edged sword.\n\n### Thicker and Oilier Skin \nTestosterone promotes the thickening and toughening of the epidermis, causing skin to become coarser. As estrogen levels fall, the body will produce less collagen. This causes the skin to become tougher and drier (especially in the knees and elbows). Veins on the hands, arms, and legs may become more pronounced, but not varicose.\n\nExpect your face and scalp to become oilier. Acne is likely to be a problem, and not just on the face. This tends to be worst immediately after dosing. This will generally improve after the first few years.\n\n### Larger Hands / Feet \nOver long periods of time (3-5 years) the hands may become tougher and more calloused. You may need to increase your ring size eventually.\n\nTestosterone also causes ligaments and tendons to retain more water, altering their flexibility. Over time this can result in an increase in foot size as the arch of the foot lowers.\n\n### Thicker and Stronger Nails \nBoth fingernails and toenails will grow thicker over time as keratin levels rise due to the presence of androgens.\n\n### Increased Muscle Mass \nAndrogens stimulate muscle growth, which is why anabolic steroids (which are literally testosterone) are so common amongst body builders. The body will naturally gain more muscle without even having to exercise, but _with_ exercise there can be substantial gains, particularly in the arms and shoulders. Beware, you won’t know your own strength at first.\n\nAdded lean muscle in the upper body redefines the shoulder and neck line, creating a more masculine silhouette. It also improves the body’s ability to process lipids, making weight loss easier.\n\n### Fat Redistribution \nWhere estrogen encourages the body to deposit fats into the thighs, buttocks, and hips, androgens encourage the body to deposit fats largely into the abdomen. Starting testosterone will encourage your body to follow the androgen pattern, so you can expect new weight to deposit into your belly, while weight loss will take away from all over. Fat in the breasts, thighs and buttocks will slowly shift away as muscle builds, but this may take a long time.\n\n### Facial Feature Changes \nAlong with body fat migration, fat in the face also moves. The neck, chin and jaw line will fill out while the lips and upper cheeks shrink. The color of the eyes may also change and become fainter in the long term, as testosterone causes the pigmentation in the iris to fade.\n\nThis is and extremely subtle and slow moving process that takes years, and it is easy to think nothing is changing at all. The greatest shifts seem to happen in years 3 and 4. Take selfies to compare.\n\n### Increased Tolerance of Caffeine, Alcohol, and/or Psychotropics \nMore mass means more blood to dilute chemicals into. Increasing testosterone also means a higher metabolic rate, increasing the speed at which toxins are removed from the blood stream.\n\n### Mental Changes \nAs covered in the Biochemical Dysphoria section, brains can be wired for a certain hormone profile, and running on the wrong profile is like using a laptop with low batteries or an overheated processor. Starting HRT almost universally results in a cessation of [[depersonalization]] and [[derealization]] (DPDR) symptoms within the first two weeks. A mental fog lifts, and it becomes easier to concentrate on complex concepts (assuming you don’t also have other mental processing difficulties such as [[ADHD]]).\n\n##### ADHD \nIf you have [[ADHD]], there may be some changes in your symptoms. Androgens amplify [dopamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine) receptor function, so increasing testosterone can improve the activation potential for dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is a key neurotransmitter in the behavior of [working memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory), the short-term memory of the brain. More working memory means you may become less prone to distractions and have an easier time maintaining [cognitive load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load).\n\n_However_, estradiol encourages the production of dopamine, so as estrogen levels fall there will be less dopamine for the brain to work with. Your symptoms worsen, not improve.\n\n##### Emotional Expansion \nThe alleviation of DPDR almost universally is accompanied with a much broader capacity for emotion and emotional regulation. Emotions become somewhat more controllable and suppressible, less likely to overwhelm on the spot. _Please note: suppressing emotions is a very quick way to develop [[trauma]]._\n\nHowever, the ability to express them may become reduced. Some people lose the ability to cry after starting on testosterone, but this is _not_ a universal experience and may be tied into how strong your T dose is. The reasons behind this aren’t well known, although some studies have found that androgens alter function in parts of the brain connected to emotional processing. If you do lose the ability to cry, it may return in time as your brain become more acclimated and you come out of second puberty.\n\n[[@salenby](https://twitter.com/salenby) I know a lot of people have the effect that they can't cry. But honestly, I'm about to cry right now just thinking about crying.\n](https://twitter.com/blotchkat/status/1374060995778318347)\n\nI'm extremely sensitive and emotional now in a way that I didn't allow myself before.\n\nI cry a lot, but it's always tears of joy now.\n\nMissing tweet for 1374070062236246022\n\nEmotional dis-regulation occurs the most commonly before and immediately after dosing (injections or gel) and results in reduced patience, increased aggression.\n\n##### Increased Appetite / Eating Capacity \nYou are going to be hungry. Testosterone cranks the body’s metabolism up significantly, and increased muscle mass means there is more to feed, so you will burn calories faster.\n\n##### Sleep \nSome people report problems with insomnia and having fewer memorable dreams. This is far from a universal, however.\n\n##### Confidence \nTestosterone is known to induce a strong sense of [[self]]-[[confidence]] in people. Problems seem less significant, [[self-love|self-esteem]] is stronger, fewer anxieties. Many people report a tendency to be more prone spark arguments, and more willing to speak out in the face of conflict and [[self]] advocate. This does _not_ mean more hostile or argumentative, simply that ones tolerance for bullshit is lower.\n\n##### Extroversion \nIt’s extremely common for [[transgender|trans]] people of all types to find themselves much more sociable post-transition. This may simply be a result of no longer having to suppress large portions of their personality, but the aforementioned [[confidence]] also plays a role.\n\n### Genital Changes \n [![](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/homology-bdbcc8c91a.jpeg)](https://www.vielma.at/) \n\nAll genitalia are constructed from the same tissues, they are merely organized differently during gestation. Much of the behavior of these tissues is regulated by the hormones ones body runs on. Skin secretions, textures, sensitivity and erectile behavior are all hormonal expressions. Which means that when you add androgens, these tissues start [[Acting]] like they are in the shape of a penis and scrotum, even when they aren’t.\n\n##### Bottom Growth \nDHT (mentioned above) plays a critical role in the development of the erectile tissue within the genitals. As DHT levels rise with the increase in Testosterone, this will cause the Skene’s Gland (sometimes referred to as the female prostate) to swell. This will induce random erections within the clitoris, causing the erectile tissue to grow. The amount of growth varies from person to person, but 1-3 inches is common.\n\n[[@salenby](https://twitter.com/salenby) [@FoxxyGlamKitty](https://twitter.com/FoxxyGlamKitty) I've been on T for literally a week and a half, and all I will say is that bottom growth and increased libido starts waaaayyyy quicker than you might think.\n](https://twitter.com/zeghostboy/status/1374094470753423360)\n\nThe clitoral hood and labia will become drier and thicker over time, and the inner labia may also start to grow hair. [[Self]] lubrication may reduce substantially, and over time penetration may become painful. Use more lube to avoid tearing and bleeding.\n\n##### Increased Emissions During Climax \nWith the swelling of the prostate comes more prostate fluid. If you weren’t a squirter before, you may become one now.\n\n##### Changes in Sensitivity and Response \nErogenous stimulation may become more focused on the head of the clitoris and in stroking of the shaft.\n\n##### Atrophy \nVaginal and uterine atrophy often happens within the first five years, and a hysterectomy may become necessary. Signs of atrophy include a deep throbbing in the lower abdomen and painful cramping without other period symptoms, particularly following intercourse. Vaginal atrophy can be avoided through the use of the same vaginal dilators that AMAB [[transgender|trans]] people use following vaginoplasty.\n\n##### Increased Sex Drive \n[[@salenby](https://twitter.com/salenby) [@chaoticgaythey](https://twitter.com/chaoticgaythey) The jokes about teenage boys always being horny, well, it's a thing. Not uncontrollably, get yourself in trouble horny, but I'd have sex multi times a day...\n](https://twitter.com/AFortune69/status/1374040823382347778)\n\nAlso, I find I 'notice' [[women]] more now, I still mostly prefer men but the ratio has adjusted a bit more towards center.\n\nLibido will almost certainly go through the roof for the first year or two, the strongest immediately following dosing. May find yourself more assertive during sex and more prone to being dominant and/or a top.\n\n##### Orgasm \n[[@salenby](https://twitter.com/salenby) Orgasms being different was meantioned and I have to second this.\n](https://twitter.com/blotchkat/status/1374053191445270534)\n\nMy clit now really functions like a small penis.\n\nSo, before I would have these orgasms that could be very intense, yet never satisfying. Now my orgasms are less intense, but it's like, I actually feel I \"finish\".\n\nThe “shape” of ones orgasm can change. Rather than a cascade, it strikes like an explosion from the groin.\n\n##### Attraction \nTestosterone has been shown to increase arousal from visual stimuli. As such, you may _notice_ people of your sexual preference much quicker, especially if you are gynephilic (attracted to the feminine shape).\n\n### Cessation of Menstruation \nThe increase of androgens within the body causes the hypothalamus to down-regulate production of the hormones which control the ovaries. This will reduce total estrogen available, and may halt ovulation. Without ovulation and with lower FSH levels, the uterus will be less inclined to build up and release a lining, causing the cessation of blood flow.\n\n[[@salenby](https://twitter.com/salenby) cw menstruation: if u take it for a while and then stop taking it for a bit your period will come back and it will be ANGRY\n](https://twitter.com/MoonyXIV/status/1374054574579798016)\n\nYou may still experience other period symptoms, however, as the hypothalamus can continue to express other aspects of the monthly cycle. This can even continue following a total hysterectomy, although it is not common.\n\n**This does _not_ mean that you are infertile, however.** Ovulation can still occur even if you are not menstruating. Additionally, halting testosterone will make the old orbs wake up, they do not die.\n","created":"2021-05-10T18:22:56 (UTC -05:00)","tags":[],"source":"https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/second-puberty-masc","author":"Jocelyn Badgley","degree":3,"nameLength":32},"position":{"x":934.1501161714833,"y":568.5556234596631},"group":"nodes","removed":false,"selected":true,"selectable":true,"locked":false,"grabbable":true,"pannable":false,"classes":"note filtered"},{"data":{"id":"core:2 A Brief History of Gender Dysphoria.md","name":"2 A Brief History of Gender Dysphoria","path":"00_Meta/Primary Sources/gender-dysphoria-bible/2 A Brief History of Gender Dysphoria.md","content":"---\ncreated: 2021-05-10T18:22:56 (UTC -05:00)\ntags: []\nsource: https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/history\nauthor: Jocelyn Badgley\n---\n\n# A Brief History of Gender Dysphoria :: That's Gender Dysphoria, FYI\n\n> ## Excerpt\n> The origins of [[Gender Dysphoria]] and the current meaning today.\n\n---\nIn 1948, noted sexologist Dr. Alfred Kinsey (yes, [_that_ Kinsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Kinsey)) was contacted by a woman whose male child adamantly insisted that they were in fact a girl, and that something had gone very wrong. The mother, rather than trying to suppress her daughter, wished to help her become who she knew herself to be. Kinsey reached out to a German endocrinologist named [Dr. Harry Benjamin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Benjamin) to see if he could help the child. Dr. Benjamin then developed a protocol of estrogen therapy for the teen, and worked with the family to find surgical help.\n\nBenjamin then went on to refine his protocol and treated thousands of patients with similar feelings over the course of his career. He refused to take payment for his work, instead taking satisfaction from the relief he granted these patients, and using their treatment to further his understanding of the condition. ==He coined a term for this feeling of incongruence in 1973: [[gender dysphoria]]. ==Unfortunately, this term would not be used in [[America|the United States]] until 2013, with the American Psychiatric Association opting for the term ==[[gender identity]] Disorder== instead.\n\n [![](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/hbscale-118dcba4b4.gif)](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/hbscale-118dcba4b4.gif) Harry Benjamin Diagnostic Scale\n\nIf you are a [[transgender|trans]] person reading this, you may have heard the name Harry Benjamin before, but probably not in a favorable context. In 1979 his name was used (with permission) in the forming of the Harry Benjamin International [[Gender Dysphoria]] Association (HBIGDA), which released a Standards of Care (SoC) for [[transgender]] people. This SoC came to be known as the Harry Benjamin Rules, and were infamously limiting in regards to how [[Gender Dysphoria]] could be diagnosed. Patients were placed within a six tier scale based upon their level of misery and sexual dysfunction. If you did not land at Tier 5 or higher, classified as a “True Transsexual”, you were usually rejected for treatment.\n\nThe problem was, Tier 5 and 6 required that you had to be exclusively attracted to your own birth sex. [[transition]] _had_ to be making you straight, not [[Queer|gay]], and bisexuals were not allowed. You also had to be experiencing severe distress with your body and genitals, and already be living as your true [[gender]] without treatment. Many [[transgender|trans]] people got around these limitations through community coaching and performative presentations, but for many people (myself included) it was believed that if you did not fit all the criteria, then you were not [[transgender|trans]] enough to transition.\n\nIn 2011 the HBIGDA reorganized itself to respond to mounting pressures in [[transgender|trans]] understanding and acceptance, taking on the new name World Professional Association for [[transgender]] Health (WPATH). Under guidance by actual [[transgender]] people (a first for the organization), WPATH then proceeded to release an entirely new Standards of Care (SoC, version 7, the first in ten years) which abandoned the Benjamin Scale, focusing on specific individual symptoms and disconnecting [[gender]] from sexuality entirely. Two years later, in 2013, the American Psychiatric Association changed their diagnostic criteria to match the WPATH SoC in their Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of [[mental disorders]] (DSM) version 5, replacing [[gender identity]] Disorder with [[Gender Dysphoria]]. With this change, medical transition became available to all [[transition]] people in [[America|the United States]].\n\nThis is why [[transgender|trans]] presence across the world has suddenly exploded in the last decade. With easier access comes larger numbers, with larger numbers comes more visibility, with more visibility comes more awareness, and with more awareness comes more people accessing treatment. [A study conducted in 2014](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/TransAgeReport.pdf) showed 0.6% of adults and 0.7% of youth in [[America|the United States]] identified as [[transgender]], [a study conducted in 2016](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6803a3.htm) showed 1.8% of high school age students identified as [[transgender]], and [a survey conducted by GLAAD in 2017](https://www.glaad.org/files/aa/2017_GLAAD_Accelerating_Acceptance.pdf) showed a whopping 12% of respondents 18 to 34 did not identify as cisgender.\n\n[[transgender]] people are coming out of the woodwork; we are everywhere.\n\n## So What Is Gender Dysphoria? \n[[Gender Dysphoria is based in a intrinsic wrongness of self]]\n> [[Def]] **Dysphoria** -> A state of unease or generalized dissatisfaction with life. The opposite of euphoria.\n [![](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/glue-f5e68b7cdf.jpeg)](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/glue-f5e68b7cdf.jpeg) \n\nThere is a common ==misconception== among both cisgender and [[transgender]] people that ==[[gender dysphoria]] refers exclusively to a physical discomfort with ones own body==. However, this belief that body discomfort is central to [[Gender Dysphoria]] is in fact a misconception, and is not even a majority component of a [[Gender Dysphoria]] diagnosis. ==[[gender dysphoria]] crosses a large number of all aspects of life, including how you interact with others, how others interact with you, how you dress, how you behave, how you fit into society, how you perceive the world around you, and yes, how you relate to your own body.== Consequently, proponents of the WPATH SoC 7 and the DSM-5 have taken to a habit of saying that ==you do not have to have dysphoria to be [[transgender]]==. This statement is often repeated like a mantra, as it informs people who do not feel significant body discomfort that they may also be [[transgender]].\n\n==In principle, [[Gender Dysphoria]] is a feeling of wrongness intrinsic to the [[self]]. There is no logical backing to this wrongness, there is nothing which explains it, you can not describe why you feel this way, it is just there. Things in your existence are incorrect, and even knowing which things _are_ incorrect can be hard to properly identify.==\n\nThe way I used to describe it is like wearing an adult’s glove when you are a child. You can put your hand into the glove, and your fingers feed into the digits of the glove, but your dexterity with the glove is severely hindered. You might be able to pick something up, but you can not manipulate it like an adult could. Things just aren’t quite right.\n\nEvey Winters described it this way [in her Dysphoria post](https://eveywinters.com/2019/10/14/on-dysphoria-before-enduring-and-after/).\n\n> Have you ever been sitting somewhere in a public or a formal place and all of a sudden the bottom of your foot itches? It’s not like you can remove your shoes right there and scratch it, so you endure the feeling of dying inside while this itch grows and grows until you are ready to murder the next person that speaks to you.\n> \n> Or when I was younger I used to watch cable TV in the mornings before school. Because it was cable TV in rural WV in the early 90’s, every so often I’d turn on my favorite channel to watch my shows while I ate my maple oatmeal and I’d be seeing Power Rangers — but the audio would be from another station (usually the weather channel). The video was fine. The audio was fine. But the mismatch between them? That’s the kind of frustration that sits with you all day as a child.\n> \n> It’s the feeling you get when you ask for a crisp refreshing Diet Coke and the server says, “Is Pepsi ok?”\n> \n> It is knowing that something is wrong and not being able to do a damn thing about it.\n\n[[gender dysphoria]] is, at its core, simply emotional reactions to the brain knowing that something does not fit. [[Yes]] ==This incongruence is so deep inside the brain’s subsystems that there is no obvious message of what the problem is. ==The only way we have to identify it is via the emotions that it triggers. Our [[conscious|consciousness]] receives either positive (euphoria) or negative (dysphoria) feedback according to how well our current environment aligns with our internal sense of [[self]]. Part of transition is learning to recognize those signals.\n\nCisgender people receive them as well, but since the signals usually align with their environment, they take them for granted. There have been a few notable occasions, however, when a cisgender person has been [put into a situation](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/maisie-williams-arya-stark-game-of-thrones-affected-her-body-image) where they experience [[gender dysphoria]]. Attempts to raise cisgender children [as the opposite sex](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/12/us/david-reimer-38-subject-of-the-john-joan-case.html) (Content warning: [[suicide]]) have always met with failure when the child inevitably declares themselves differently.\n\nThese impulses of euphoria and dysphoria, arousal and aversion, they all manifest in many different ways, some obvious, some much more subtle. Dysphoria changes over time as well, taking on new shapes as one moves from pre-awareness into understanding and through [[transition]]. The goal of this book is to break down these manifestations into their distinct categories and describe them so that others may learn to recognize them.\n\nHowever, first I must stress something very important, so important that I am putting it into big bold letters:\n\n**EVERY SINGLE [[transgender|TRANS]] PERSON EXPERIENCES A DIFFERENT SET OF DYSPHORIA SOURCES AND INTENSITIES**\n\nThere is no one single [[transgender|trans]] experience, there is no standard set of feelings and discomforts, there _is no one true [[transgender|trans]] narrative_. Every [[transgender|trans]] person experiences dysphoria in their own way to their own degree, and what bothers one person may not bother another.\n\nOk, that disclaimer out of the way, let’s get to the meat and potatoes.\n","created":"2021-05-10T18:22:56 (UTC -05:00)","tags":[],"source":"https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/history","author":"Jocelyn Badgley","degree":8,"nameLength":37},"position":{"x":988.6282283864118,"y":214.65932421267604},"group":"nodes","removed":false,"selected":true,"selectable":true,"locked":false,"grabbable":true,"pannable":false,"classes":"note filtered"},{"data":{"id":"core:20 In Conclusion.md","name":"20 In Conclusion","path":"00_Meta/Primary Sources/gender-dysphoria-bible/20 In Conclusion.md","content":"---\ncreated: 2021-05-10T18:22:56 (UTC -05:00)\ntags: []\nsource: https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/conclusion\nauthor: Jocelyn Badgley\n---\n\n# In Conclusion :: That's Gender Dysphoria, FYI\n\n> ## Excerpt\n> Enough with the gatekeeping already.\n\n---\n**The [[Gender Dysphoria]] Bible is a Living Document**\n\nThe contents of this site will change over time as new additions and revisions are made to further expand upon the full breadth of [[Gender Dysphoria]]. In its current iteration it is severely lacking in AFAB narratives, [[non-binary]], agender & genderfluid specific dysphoria, and Third [[Gender]] narratives. The GDB is an open source and publicly funded project, [content](https://github.com/GenderDysphoria/GenderDysphoria.fyi) and [fiscal](https://patreon.com/curvyandtrans) contributions are extremely welcome.\n\n## Conclusion \nEvery single year we get new studies that show an increase in the size of the [[transgender]] population. As awareness continues to grow, more and more people are realizing what has been wrong with their lives and are coming out of the closet. People who transitioned decades ago are coming out of stealth. GLAAD estimates as much as 3% of the population could be [[transgender]], and I have seen numbers as high as 5% or even 10% from more liberal estimations. The more we come to understand about [[gender]], the more language we gain to describe [[gender]], the more people realize that the rigid Male and Female sexual structure that we have been forced into is false.\n\nYet all this change frightens people. It frightens conservatives who see their patriarchal social structures dissolving under the new understanding of [[gender]]. It frightens old-school [[transgender]] people who transitioned under the Harry Benjamin rules and now see so many people easily obtaining what they had to act and lie and manipulate to achieve. They fear that if anyone can be [[transgender|trans]], then the public will stop taking [[transgender|trans]] people seriously. It frightens the misogynistic [[transgender|trans]]-exclusionary groups that fight so hard to invalidate [[transgender]] rights, because they think if anyone can be a man or a woman, then their status as a man or a woman is harmed.\n\nThere is no such thing as a “Transtrender”.\n\nThere is no such thing as “Rapid Onset [[Gender Dysphoria]]”.\n\nThere is no such thing as anyone “transing” kids.\n\nThese mentalities have to stop.\n","created":"2021-05-10T18:22:56 (UTC -05:00)","tags":[],"source":"https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/conclusion","author":"Jocelyn Badgley","degree":3,"nameLength":16},"position":{"x":751.3811704277609,"y":327.7977412514706},"group":"nodes","removed":false,"selected":true,"selectable":true,"locked":false,"grabbable":true,"pannable":false,"classes":"note filtered"},{"data":{"id":"core:3 Gender Euporia.md","name":"3 Gender Euporia","path":"00_Meta/Primary Sources/gender-dysphoria-bible/3 Gender Euporia.md","content":"---\ncreated: 2021-05-10T18:22:56 (UTC -05:00)\ntags: []\nsource: https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/euphoria\nauthor: Jocelyn Badgley\n---\n\n# How Gender Dysphoria Manifests: Euphoria :: That's Gender Dysphoria, FYI\n\n> ## Excerpt\n> In order for there to be shadow there must be light.\n\n---\n**The [[Gender Dysphoria]] Bible is a Living Document**\n\nThe contents of this site will change over time as new additions and revisions are made to further expand upon the full breadth of [[Gender Dysphoria]]. In its current iteration it is severely lacking in AFAB narratives, [[non-binary]], agender & genderfluid specific dysphoria, and Third [[Gender]] narratives. The GDB is an open source and publicly funded project, [content](https://github.com/GenderDysphoria/GenderDysphoria.fyi) and [fiscal](https://patreon.com/curvyandtrans) contributions are extremely welcome.\n\n> [[Def]] **Euphoria** -> A feeling or state of intense excitement and [[happiness]]. Elation, joy, glee.\n\nBefore I can talk about discomfort, I have to talk about relief. ==[[Gender Euphoria]] is itself a sign of [[gender dysphoria]]==. You might be asking yourself, “how can [[happiness]] be sadness?” The answer to that is simple.\n\nImagine a person who was born in a cave, who spent their entire life living underground, their only source of illumination being candles and oil lamps. Imagine they’ve never been above ground, they don’t even know the surface exists. Then one day a cave-in happens in a side tunnel, and reveals an opening to the surface. Sunlight pours into the opening, and at first it is blinding and the person runs away in fear. Later they return to the opening, and as the person’s eyes adjust they look out through the hole and see a bright and brilliant world full of colors they didn’t even know existed.\n\nThat world is scary, it’s huge and full of unknowns, so they crawl back into the cave for safety, but that hole is still there, and they see the light every time they pass it. Gradually they peek out more and more frequently, and further and further from the opening. They start to want that light, they find reasons to visit it more often.\n\nEventually they realize that they don’t want to go back into the hole any more. They have to go back, because that is where their family and friends are, but this place is so much better, they want to stay here. Going back into the hole feels wrong, it starts to hurt to be in the dark so much.\n\nThis is what [[Gender Euphoria]] is like, it is brief flashes of a light that may be too bright to handle at first, too confusing to understand, but as time goes on you become more accustomed to them and you realize that this is where you belong, and the darkness becomes the dysphoria.\n\n[Fish don't notice water. It's all around them. Most fish have never left it.\n](https://twitter.com/NightlingBug/status/1215716433210105856)\n\n==And often, [[transgender|trans]] people in denial don't notice the [[gender dysphoria]] that suffuses their daily lives.==\n\nI'm just going to list some idiosyncrasies and discomforts that I didn't realize were dysphoria:\n\nMany [[transgender|trans]] people have no idea how much pain they are in until they find small bits of relief. Cosplay, stage [[Acting]], drag, role playing games, video games; small little forays into a different [[gender]] than they have lived as. They find that it feels just a little bit more comfortable. They’ll make up excuses for why (“If I’m gonna be looking at this character’s ass, it might as well be a girl’s ass.”), they’ll try to convince themselves it’s all just for fun, or an artistic expression. They might tell themselves that the bits of joy they feel at hearing a different pronoun are just novelty. But soon they find themselves looking for reasons to get that more often. More and more frequently they’re role playing characters of a different sex, building more costumes, buying more clothes, performing more often. You find yourself wanting to do that all the time, because it just feels better than your real life, and being “you” starts to hurt. Eventually, the old you becomes the costume.\n\nThis is the most fundamental reason why we as a community say “you do not need dysphoria to be [[transgender|trans]]”, because black ink on a black canvas isn’t visible without close examination and a lot of light.\n\nAnything that can be a source of dysphoria has an equal and opposite euphoria.\n\n[Just finished 22 valentines cards for my son's daycare class. We wandered about Target to get some candy. It is great just existing, being myself, with my son and living life being seen the way I truly am.\n](https://twitter.com/ErinInTheMorn/status/1228141518386585607)\n\nEven all of his daycare friends say \"your mom's here!\" :)\n\nExamples:\n\n-   Being gendered correctly\n-   Being addressed by your chosen name\n-   Wearing correctly gendered clothing\n-   Seeing and feeling changes in your body\n-   Seeing yourself in the mirror (removal of [[depersonalization]])\n-   Socializing in a way that conforms with gendered expectations\n-   Getting a haircut in a masculine / feminine / androgynous manner\n-   Shaving your legs\n-   NOT shaving your legs\n-   Being included in something you wouldn’t otherwise because of your assigned [[gender]] (e.g. bridal party or bachelor shower)\n-   Feeling sexy / having sex in a way that aligns with your [[gender]] and sexuality.\n\nEven just being out in the world as yourself and being seen as yourself can be massively euphoric.\n\n==**What euphoria is NOT** is a sexual high, turn on, or fetish==. Sometimes euphoria can trigger a sexual response, and there are many factors at play that cause that (feeling good about your body is a turn on, for example), but it is not a source of sexual excitement. [[transgender|Trans]] people are not “getting off” on presenting or [[Acting]] like their true selves.\n\nThat said, many people who have not yet realized they are [[transgender|trans]] may resort to fetishes and kinks to express their [[gender]] and/or relieve their dysphoria. They may maintain some of these kinks through transition. There is no shame in this, how they find sexual fulfillment is their own [[business]]. However, these things are _alongside_ their [[gender]]. ==A [[transgender|trans]] person’s sense of [[gender]] persists indefinitely, it does not go away when they go back to their daily lives.==\n","created":"2021-05-10T18:22:56 (UTC -05:00)","tags":[],"source":"https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/euphoria","author":"Jocelyn Badgley","degree":4,"nameLength":16},"position":{"x":1045.4504315508555,"y":207.6967611715465},"group":"nodes","removed":false,"selected":true,"selectable":true,"locked":false,"grabbable":true,"pannable":false,"classes":"note filtered"},{"data":{"id":"core:4 Physical Dysphoria.md","name":"4 Physical Dysphoria","path":"00_Meta/Primary Sources/gender-dysphoria-bible/4 Physical Dysphoria.md","content":"Everyone has heard of the “born in the wrong body” narrative. Physical Dysphoria is discomfort over the shape of one’s body due to the sexual characteristics it presents. So what body features are we talking about here?\n\n#### Primary Sex Characteristics\n\nThe core reproductive features which develop during pregnancy\n\n-   Gonads\n    -   Testicles\n    -   Ovaries\n-   External Genitalia\n    -   Penis\n    -   Clitoris\n    -   Scrotum\n    -   Labia\n    -   Vulva\n-   Internal Reproductive Organs\n    -   Prostate / Skene’s Gland\n    -   Uterus\n\n#### Secondary Sexual Characteristics\n\nAll sexually dimorphic features which develop during and after puberty as a result of hormone exposure. In general, these features are all nearly identical for both male and female prepubescent children.\n\n-   Fat Distribution\n    -   Waist, Hips, Butt Shape\n    -   Thighs, Arms, Back\n    -   Cheeks and Jaw Line\n-   Muscle Mass\n    -   Neck, Shoulders and Upper Body\n    -   Arms and Legs\n    -   Abdominal\n-   Skeletal Build\n    -   Range of Height\n    -   Size of Feet and Hands\n    -   Width of Shoulders\n    -   Rib Cage Breadth\n    -   Thickness and Density of Limbs\n    -   Forehead, Brow, Cheek and Jaw bones\n    -   Pelvic Width\n-   Skin Texture and Tone\n-   Voice Pitch and Resonance\n-   Breast Development\n-   Facial Hair\n-   Body Hair (excluding genitals and arm pits)\n\n#### For Your Information\n\nThe genitals of a [[transgender]] person on hormone therapy do not behave remotely like their cisgender counterparts.\n\n-   The Estrogenic Penis softens, erections become less pronounced, the skin thins and begins to perspire like a vaginal wall. The scrotum softens and changes color, with the perineal raphe becoming more distinct. Due to the cessation of random erections, the erectile tissue will atrophy if not regularly put to use, causing the entire penis to shrink over time. Vibration becomes more effective for arousal.\n\n-   The Androgenic Vagina becomes dryer & prone to tearing (lubrication can be an issue). The skin of the clitoris thickens, and the clitoral glans grows in length and girth due to the onset of random erections. Labia also become thicker, and often hairier. The onset of HRT often results in extreme sensitivity of the clitoris.\n\n\nPrimary characteristics can only be altered through surgical intervention. Some secondary sexual characteristics are also one-way trips and require medical intervention to undo, namely the growth of breast tissue and the deepening of the vocal chords. Estrogen does not make the voice more feminine, Testosterone does not make breasts shrink (aside from the loss of fat). Changes to skeletal structure (such as enlarging from testosterone and the widening of hips from estrogen) can only occur prior to the age of 25, while the body is still growing.\n\nSome secondary traits can be surgically enhanced (Breast Augmentation, body contouring, facial masculinization / feminization), and some cannot be changed at all.\n\nPhysical dysphoria manifests in several different ways. Sometimes this is felt in a sort of phantom limb phenomenon, where the person can feel sensations from a penis or vagina that is not there, an ache in a uterus that does not exist, or a sense of absence on the chest from breasts that have not grown in.\n\nIt can be felt as a sort of _reverse_ phantom effect, where the person is persistently aware of something that should _not_ be there. The brain is receiving sensory input that it does not expect, such as the weight of breasts, or the presence of testicles or a uterus, and this input takes priority because it isn’t expected.\n\nIt may be felt as horror or revulsion when looking at or touching the external genitals, triggering emotional outbursts or a strong [[desire]] to remove the offending organ. AFAB (assigned female at birth) [[transgender|trans]] people may experience feelings of wrongness during menstruation, or a sense of alien disconnect from their hormone cycle.\n\nWhen my friends back in high school would discuss who their ideal woman was, they were all describing physical traits of a person they’d want to date... as I explained who I wanted to be.\n\nI always thought everyone had a dirty little secret like mine. A bit of closet shame.\n\n[[No]] ==It can manifest as a compulsion to be rid of certain body traits, such as obsessively shaving body or facial hair. This can also manifest in the opposite compulsion, leading to meticulous grooming of those traits in order to try to control them, like maintaining a perfect beard, persistently keeping ones nails manicured and polished, or spending hours in the gym attempting to hone ones shape.==\n\nUndesired physical features may prompt a person to experience [[envy]] of people who have been forced to remove those features due to illnesses, such as testicular or breast cancer. AMABs with severe genital dysphoria tend to have a wish for some kind of freak accident that would cause the loss of their phallus.\n\n[[Yes]] ==Sometimes it may just simply be a feeling of being incorrect, which you may not even attribute to [[gender]] or sex. ==For most of my life I believed that the reason I hate my body was because I was fat. It wasn’t until I started transition that I realized I don’t hate my fat at all, I hated having _male_ fat. The feminine curves that HRT gave me make me feel so much more in tune with my body.\n\nThe dysphoria one feels about their body can and will change over time, for better and worse. For example, many [[transgender|trans]] [[women]] enter into transition feeling no disconnect with their genitals, but later find that as larger sources of dysphoria melt away, that they become less comfortable with their original configuration. Alternatively, some may assume that they will absolutely need facial feminization surgery, but then 2 years in to transition, realize they’re actually okay with how they look.\n\nIt’s okay for you to realize you need more or less than when you started.\n\n[[Yes]] ==It’s okay if you don’t hate anything about your body, and just wish you looked more feminine or masculine.==\n\nIt’s okay if you only hate some aspects of your body, and don’t wish to change all of its sexual characteristics.\n\nIt’s okay if you don’t need medical transition _at all_. Body feelings are not the be-all-end-all of transition.\n\n**Total body physical dysphoria is not a requirement to be [[transgender]]. AFABs do not have to hate their chest, AMABs do not have to hate their penis. Every [[transgender|trans]] person’s experience is different. All are valid.**\n\n### Internalized Body Image Issues \nThe world is full of [[subconscious]] messages about how men and [[women]]’s bodies should be shaped. We are bombarded with advertising and [[media]] creating a normalized view of what is and is not beautiful. Don’t be too fat, don’t be too skinny, don’t be too tall, don’t be too short, don’t have too broad of a chin, don’t have too large of a nose, wear makeup but don’t wear too much makeup, don’t leave the house without a bra, but don’t let the bra show. On and on and on, the constant barrage of expectations of gendered appearance.\n\nEveryone absorbs these messages, and [[transgender|trans]] people internalize the factors which matter to the [[gender]] they align with. [[transgender|Trans]] girls grow up mapping feminine standards onto themselves, [[transgender|trans]] boys map masculine standards on to themselves, and enbies often internalize shame around androgyny. This is _on top_ of the shame they are loaded with for not living up to their assigned [[gender]]’s standards.\n\nWhat is the end result of this? Kathryn said it best:\n\n[@TransSalamander](https://twitter.com/TransSalamander/status/947522372315369472)\n\n> ==If you're under the assumption that you're a cis guy but have always dreamed of being a girl, and the only reason you haven't transitioned is because you're afraid you'll be an \"ugly\" girl:==\n>\n> ==That's dysphoria.

Typically by week 11 it is possible to determine the genitals of a fetus via ultrasound. The brain, however, forms [between weeks 14 and 24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2989000/[[Sec5title]]). Current prevailing understanding of [[Neuroscience|neurological]] development suggests that it is during these 10 weeks when the brain will either masculinize or feminize based upon the presence of testosterone in the fetus bloodstream (initiated by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome, or introduced from other sources). ==This process locks the brain into a pattern of either desiring estrogens or androgens.==\n\nIf your brain is wired for one gonadal hormones (such as testosterone) and your body produces the other hormone (such as estradiol), this can result in a biochemical malfunction within your brain chemistry. This produces a sort of brain fog, a reduction in mental capacity, and a general state of [[anxiety]] and unease. This is the source of the first two symptoms that often alleviate with medical hormonal therapy, [[depersonalization]] and [[derealization]] (DPDR).\n\n[[Def]] **[[depersonalization]]** -> a disconnect from your own body, an inability to believe that the person you see in the mirror is actually yourself.  ^f732ac\n- [[Yes]] ==You feel like you are watching someone else in your body.

This can also manifest as a feeling of otherworldliness, like you don’t belong in this society. You’re just walking around waiting for your super powers to appear, or for an owl to fly up with your letter to Hogwarts. As a teen I was obsessed with an episode of The Outer Limits where a boy discovers a spaceship under his house and learns that he and his [[parents]] aren’t actually human.\n\n[[Yes]] ==DPDR sometimes comes with an emotional stunting. You are able to laugh and find humor, but rarely ever genuine joy. Moments of sadness or grief cause you to just go numb, dissociated by the event that caused it.== [[Yes]] ==This can also go in the opposite direction, where the person is under so much [[anxiety]] that their emotional response is extremely disproportionate to the catalyst, resulting in severe crying or violent outbursts from seemingly small events.==\n\n==It’s important to note that DPDR is not exclusive to [[gender dysphoria]]==. This condition is co-morbid with several other [[mental health]] issues, including chronic [[depression]], [[OCD | obsessive compulsive disorder]], and [[bpd | borderline personality disorder]]. DPDR should not be taken as a sign of [[gender dysphoria]] purely on its own, it’s just a big alarm signal that something is very wrong. It’s also usually pretty easy to spot externally, once you know how to watch for it. [[No]] ==People with DPDR tend to have a mile long stare as they move about in the world; eyes so gloomy and dead that they look like a shell.== One of the most common comments on transition timelines is how the eyes gain so much spark.\n\n### The Ebb and Flow \nThe intensity of physical and biochemical dysphoria is highly influenced by other factors in the body. Because it is a function of endocrine balance, it is also manipulated by those balances. This means that it can rise and fall from day to day. For example:\n\n-   [[TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH]]  If your blood sugar is out of whack, or you have a thyroid condition, it could cause your dysphoria to spike.\n- ==If you are having dopamine withdrawal because of ceasing stimulants, that can make it worse.==\n-   If you start on an SSRI Antidepressant and start running with more serotonin, that can make it less intense.\n-   Transfeminine AMABs (people assigned male at birth) with testicles experience surges in testosterone in relation to attraction and [[desire]], which can make them more dysphoric.\n-   Transmasculine AFABs (people assigned female at birth) with unsuppressed ovaries experience rises and falls in estrogen and progesterone over the course of their menstrual cycle, making their dysphoria intensify and lessen based on what day of the cycle they are on.\n\nThere are dozens of systems in the body that all work in tandem, and they all fluctuate from day to day, manipulating general mental state. This general dysphoria can amplify the affect of all other dysphoria. One day you can shrug off misgendering like it’s nothing, and then the next it hurts like a stab in the heart every time. One day you see yourself in the mirror, the next you’re staring at the old you.\n\nSome people experience this in a genderfluid way, with some days leaning male, same days leaning female, and other days not feeling any [[gender]], or both. Others just feel it like a seasonal river; sometimes it swells because of rains up stream, sometimes it slows to a trickle because of drought.\n\n==**All of this is valid, and just because you feel very dysphoric one day and not dysphoric the next does not mean that you aren’t really [[transgender|trans]].**==\n\n### This Happens Both Ways \n[Worth noting that in the event a confused cis person were to attempt medical transition without being stopped by any of the absurd number of gate keepers and actual medical professionals whose sign-off is typically needed, here's what would happen: They take some pills, or a shot\n](https://twitter.com/SecretGamerGrrl/status/1222738910821978113)\n[which will then proceed to make them feel absolutely awful, like pouring sugar into the gas tank of their brain. At which point one assumes they would immediately cease taking the hormone supplements they did not actually need and resume a normal life with no lasting consequence\n](https://twitter.com/SecretGamerGrrl/status/1222739427312750594)\n[Should a REALLY stubborn and confused cis person ignore feeling like total garbage and keep on taking HRT they shouldn't be taking for several months, they might also experience some acne and/or their skin clearing up and looking great, and a woman might start growing facial hair\n](https://twitter.com/SecretGamerGrrl/status/1222740261178105856)\n[a man in such a position might deal with gynecomastia after like, a year or so, give or take, of again, feeling like complete garbage from taking unneeded estradiol supplements.

Where, again, things would just then go back to normal.\n](https://twitter.com/SecretGamerGrrl/status/1222743360034758656)\n\nOh and all of this is me talking about HRT. Usually what bigots are doing is talking about\n\n[puberty blockers as if they were HRT. If some confused cis kid takes puberty blockers the grand total of what would actually happen is.. not starting puberty until they realized they were taking them for no particular reason and stopped. No side effects of any sort to worry about\n](https://twitter.com/SecretGamerGrrl/status/1222743749920464896)\n\nSometimes you will hear naysayers suggesting that taking hormone therapy always improves [[mental health]]. I heard this myself when I came out to my mother. “Estrogen makes everyone happier.” This is flat out false. When cis people are put on cross hormone therapy it always results in dysphoria. This is one reason why Spironolactone is rarely ever prescribed to men, because the anti-androgen factor causes mental instability. Five to ten percent of cis [[women]] suffer from Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS), a condition which causes the ovaries to produce testosterone instead of estrogen. Ask any one of them how their [[mental health]] has been, and they will give you an ear full.\n\nOne very potent demonstration of this is the tragic case of [David Reimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Reimer). At seven months of age David and his twin brother were given circumcisions to treat a bad case of phimosis (a skin condition on the foreskin). David’s went horribly wrong, and the penis was destroyed. The decision was made to perform vaginoplasty and raise him as a girl, including estrogen therapy at pubescence. By the age of 13 he was deep into suicidal [[depression]] and [[suffering]] greatly, as no amount of coaching and encouraging can make a boy enjoy being a girl. When his [[parents]] informed him of what had happened, he returned to a male presentation, switched to testosterone therapy, and over the course of his teen years had multiple operations in order to transition back to male.\n\nPeople know when they’re living the wrong [[gender]].\n\nPsychologist John Money oversaw David’s case and was largely responsible for the decisions that were made in David’s upbringing. Money, seeking to make a name for himself, massively misreported on David’s case, calling it a complete success in his reports. The result of this echoes to this day, as Money’s reports were used as an example of why performing genital corrective surgeries on intersex infants was an appropriate course of action. Fifty years later there are still doctors who believe that you can just change a child’s genitals and raise them as that [[gender]], and it will stick.\n\nThis is the tragedy of the [intersex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex) community. Roughly one in every 60 births results in some kind of intersex condition (though not all of these are related to genitalia). Often times the “corrective” procedures used on intersex children results in a loss of function and/or sensation. Far too frequently, doctors would opt towards forced female assignment because it was easier to construct a vulva than a penis.\n","created":"2021-05-10T18:22:56 (UTC -05:00)","tags":[],"source":"https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/biochemical-dysphoria","author":"Jocelyn Badgley","degree":8,"nameLength":23},"position":{"x":923.6940811079415,"y":185.49250569119556},"group":"nodes","removed":false,"selected":true,"selectable":true,"locked":false,"grabbable":true,"pannable":false,"classes":"note filtered"},{"data":{"id":"core:6 Social Dysphoria.md","name":"6 Social Dysphoria","path":"00_Meta/Primary Sources/gender-dysphoria-bible/6 Social Dysphoria.md","content":"---\ncreated: 2021-05-10T18:22:56 (UTC -05:00)\ntags: []\nsource: https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/social-dysphoria\nauthor: Jocelyn Badgley\n---\n\n# How Gender Dysphoria Manifests: Social Dysphoria :: That's Gender Dysphoria, FYI\n\n> ## Excerpt\n> Pronouns and Deadnames and Gendering, oh my.\n\n---\n**The [[Gender Dysphoria]] Bible is a Living Document**\n\nThe contents of this site will change over time as new additions and revisions are made to further expand upon the full breadth of [[Gender Dysphoria]].

You scramble to get their approval back. You're worried you're coming across as a simpering \"nice guy,\" all of whom you despise. You just value your AFAB friends' opinions more highly, for reasons you can't explain.==\n](https://twitter.com/NightlingBug/status/1215731319973523456)\n\nAll social [[gender dysphoria]] orbits around one central concept: What [[Gender]] do people believe me to be? Social Dysphoria is about how the outside world perceives you, how others address you, and how you are expected to address them. This applies differently prior to the [[transgender|trans]] person becoming [[self]]-aware of their own [[gender]], versus how Social Dysphoria is experienced after a [[transgender|trans]] awakening (cracking one’s shell).\n\n==While still in the dark, the only awareness is that something seems off about the way you interact with your interactions with other people.== People of your assigned [[gender]] seem to interact with each other in ways that do not feel natural to you. [[No]] ==Their behaviors and mannerisms feel strange and surprising, where interactions with individuals of your true [[gender]] feel easier.== You relate to people closer to your own truth.\n\n[[Sometimes]] ==For example, an AMAB [[transgender|trans]] person may find themselves very uncomfortable in groups of men. They may feel out of place and struggle to fit in among their male peers. Masculine social interactions don’t come naturally to them, and trying to emulate their male friends feels awkward.== [[Yes]] ==They may feel themselves drawn more to friendships with [[women]], but become frustrated at the social and heterosexual dynamics that come into play between men and [[women]], preventing them from forming platonic relationships.== This is if [[women]] are willing to form friendships at all. [[Yes]] ==They may find themselves deeply hurt when [[women]] shy away from them on principle.==\n\nThis feeling of wrongness intensifies as the person becomes more and more aware of their own incongruence, and upon realizing who they really are it takes on a new shape. For binary [[transgender|trans]] people this often may be about the intense need to be seen as your true [[gender]], be it male or female. Some [[non-binary]] people experience this more as euphoria at being seen as neither male or female and thus only being referred to in ungendered ways, or from being read as different genders by different people in the same setting. Some experience intense euphoria when people are incapable of reading their [[gender]] and become confused.\n\nSocial dysphoria is where pronouns and misgendering come into play; being addressed with a gendered pronoun such as she, he, him, or her which is not the pronoun that aligns with our [[gender]] is extremely discomforting. Granted, this is true for _all_ people, including cisgender people, but where a cis person will be insulted by being misgendered, a [[transgender|trans]] person will feel hurt. It’s like nails on a chalkboard, or steel wool across skin. Hearing the wrong pronoun is a reminder that the person you are talking to does not recognize you for the [[gender]] that you are.\n\n[[Gender]] neutral pronouns can also be unsettling for binary [[transgender|trans]] people if used in a way that make it clear the person is avoiding the pronoun that matches them. This often is an indication that a person has been read as being [[transgender]], and the person addressing them doesn’t know what pronouns they use. Asking their pronouns can resolve this situation immediately, but the paradox is that even in that scenario, having their pronouns asked may itself induce dysphoria around having been recognized as being [[transgender|trans]]. It is sort of a catch-22.\n\nSingular they can also be used maliciously when a transphobic individual refuses to use the correct pronoun, but knows they will get in trouble for using the wrong pronouns. Tone and intent matter a lot.\n\nThe same also applies to names. Being called by one’s given name (deadname) instead of their chosen name can feel invalidating when done ignorantly, and downright dismissive when done intentionally.\n\nIt may also manifest as joy or embarrassment at being labeled as your true [[gender]] while still living as your assigned [[gender]]. Examples:\n\n-   An AMAB person being labeled a girl, intending insult, but it causing them to blush rather than get angry.\n-   An AFAB person being called Sir, and feeling better for it.\n\n[The irony in “[[transgender|trans]] [[women]] mimic [[gender]] stereotypes” is the only time I DID mimic stereotypes was when I was forced to interact with men. And I did so out of a sense of survival and a longing to try and fit in.\n](https://twitter.com/Emmy_Zje/status/1219968711681040384)\n\nI didn’t transition into stereotypes…I transitioned out of them.\n\nThe discomfort caused by social dysphoria can pressure a [[transgender|trans]] person to act and present in an exaggerated manner in order to try to convince the rest of the world that they really are who they say they are. Transfeminine people may concentrate on makeup and feminine clothes, and become quieter in order to seem more demure, speaking in a higher voice. Transmasculine people will lean on masculine clothing styles, stand taller, suppress displays of emotion, start speaking louder, and make their voices intentionally deeper.\n\nSome physical traits which may cause discomfort all the time for some [[transgender|trans]] people may only manifest as a social dysphoria for others. For example, some people may only be [[self]] [[conscious]] about their physical appearance when it causes them to be misgendered or clocked (read as being [[transgender|trans]]), and feel completely comfortable when interacting in environments where they are always seen and treated as their true [[gender]].\n\nI, myself, have no direct physical dysphoria around my voice, I actually really enjoy singing in my natal baritone, and when I am home with just my family I let my voice relax. When out in public, however, being able to speak in a feminine voice plays a critical role in my being seen as a woman by strangers, so I put a lot of effort into training it into a feminine sound. My feminine voice turns on the instant I answer the phone or leave the house, it isn’t even a [[conscious]] thing.\n\n### “One of us!” \nA very curious and surprisingly phenomenon is that closeted [[transgender|trans]] people have a tendency to find each other without ever knowing they’ve done it. There’s a funny pattern that I have heard duplicated over and over where one person in a friend group realizes they are [[transgender]], starts to transition, and that inspires other members of the group to also realize they are [[transgender|trans]] and come out as well.\n\n[i can know a cis woman for a year and not feel like i'm all that close to her.\n](https://twitter.com/persenche/status/1137185510793678848)\n\ni can know a [[transgender|trans]] woman for three hours and feel like i've known her my whole life.\n\n[[transgender|Trans]] people [[subconscious|subconsciously]] tend to gravitate towards each other’s friendships, both out of a need for peers who think and act the same as us without judgments, and due to a kinship of social ostracization. This is not exclusive to [[transgender|trans]] people, of course, and occurs with all types of [[Queer]] people, but the way it has a rippling effect is quite powerful. It’s very similar to the way an entire friend group will get married and have kids all in response to one member of the group initiating.\n\n[[transgender|Trans]] people often continue to [[self]]-select their groups post-transition as well, as we simply understand each other better than cis people can. There is an energy that occurs when a group of [[transgender|trans]] people get together in a location, the room becomes charged with camaraderie and commiseration. We all have so much in common in our histories, so many shared experiences, that (short of personality conflicts) we instantly bond together.\n","created":"2021-05-10T18:22:56 (UTC -05:00)","tags":[],"source":"https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/social-dysphoria","author":"Jocelyn Badgley","degree":7,"nameLength":18},"position":{"x":929.1704979817116,"y":228.48212212414728},"group":"nodes","removed":false,"selected":true,"selectable":true,"locked":false,"grabbable":true,"pannable":false,"classes":"note filtered"},{"data":{"id":"core:7 Societal Dysphoria.md","name":"7 Societal Dysphoria","path":"00_Meta/Primary Sources/gender-dysphoria-bible/7 Societal Dysphoria.md","content":"---\ncreated: 2021-05-10T18:22:56 (UTC -05:00)\ntags: []\nsource: https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/societal-dysphoria\nauthor: Jocelyn Badgley\n---\n\n# How Gender Dysphoria Manifests: Societal Dysphoria :: That's Gender Dysphoria, FYI\n\n> ## Excerpt\n> Because a Role is a Role, and a Toll is a Toll, and it's a heavy toll to live the wrong role.\n\n---\n**The [[Gender Dysphoria]] Bible is a Living Document**\n\nThe contents of this site will change over time as new additions and revisions are made to further expand upon the full breadth of [[Gender Dysphoria]].

The GDB is an open source and publicly funded project, [content](https://github.com/GenderDysphoria/GenderDysphoria.fyi) and [fiscal](https://patreon.com/curvyandtrans) contributions are extremely welcome.\n\n[[Gender]] roles exist, and as much as we may try to buck them and point out the sexism that exists, there will always be expectations placed on people for their [[gender]]. The strongest of these are in marital and parental roles; “Husband”, “Wife”, “Mother”, “Father”, these terms come with loads of baggage attached to them, and the wrong role, or even any role at all, can feel like a lead lined straight jacket. You are given a whole book full of behaviors and actions, likes and dislikes, that you are just expected to fulfill, and if you fail to meet those requirements then you are seen as a bad spouse or a bad parent.\n\nAn AFAB parent who gives birth may experience severe dysphoria around being labeled as a mother. The vast majority of resources for birth are _extremely_ female gendered, so just the very process of conceiving, carrying, and giving birth is exceptionally loaded with [[gender]] expectations. If you are pregnant then you are labeled a mom, regardless of how you actually feel about your role, and with that comes a whole load of assumptions. Assumptions about caregiving, breastfeeding, and child rearing.\n\n[Cisgender-passing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passing_(gender)) transfeminine individuals also run into this. If you are holding an infant or tending to a child then you are labeled a mom (unless the child is mixed race, then you’re demoted to nanny, but that’s a whole other topic). This can be validating, because it is a sign that you’ve been seen as a woman, but it can also be extremely _invalidating_ when cis [[women]] start to talk about what they think are shared experiences with reproductive processes.\n\nSome unexpected ways that Societal Dysphoria can appear are in the need to conform to the social standards of your true [[gender]]. [[Yes]] ==For example, many [[transgender|trans]] [[women]] have stories about feeling the need to cover up their chest pre-transition out of an intrinsic sense of modesty.== A discomfort at swimming topless is a common trait, even when there is no understanding of one’s true [[self]]; something just knows.\n\n### Shame \nFailure to live up to these roles can manifest _intensely_ as shame and humiliation. Growing up closeted and struggling to fit into common [[gender]] tropes often results in signs of disappointment from [[parents]] and peers who expected otherwise. A father may be disappointed that their AMAB child isn’t willing to engage in sports or other masculine activities. Female peers may demonstrate disapproval of an AFAB teenager choosing to hang out with a male social circle. Teen boys may ostracize an AMAB [[transgender|trans]] person who doesn’t join in with their humor.\n\nThese kinds of situations can lead to bullying and abuse, pushing the [[transgender|trans]] person to feel isolated, alone, and out of place. This sense of division then creates feelings of shame for failing to be the person everyone expects them to be. This then manifests as [[depression]] on top of other dysphoria, compounding their pain.\n\n[Guilt is a byproduct of shame, shame is a byproduct of transphobia, and transphobia is a byproduct of lies based in fear.\n](https://twitter.com/Emmy_Zje/status/1201138482569195526)\n\nOnce you realize this, you can begin to see “[[transgender|trans]]” for what it is...a beautiful manifestation of nature. A gift to be cherished, not a curse to be hidden.\n\nThe shame becomes especially intense at the moment of revealing themselves to be [[transgender|trans]]. Transphobic friends and family having negative, sometimes even violent reactions to a [[transgender|trans]] person coming out of the closet converts that shame into extreme [[guilt]] and disgrace. An adult [[transgender|trans]] person in a marriage may feel a tremendous amount of remorse at upending their spouse’s life by revealing themselves. They may expect reproach from their neighbors and peers, and fear how that will affect their spouse and/or children.\n\n==This too is a form of [[gender dysphoria]], as these influences would not have been felt if the person had been cisgender.==\n\nThe other way shame comes in to play is in the systemic transphobia present in our society. [[transgender|Trans]] adults of today grew up watching transphobic [[media]] in their childhood. The transsexual obsession of the late 80s and early 90s was horrifically traumatic for [[transgender|trans]] kids of the time, watching all the adults and peers around them laugh and jeer at and be disgusted by people who they not only identified with, but strongly empathized and looked up to. This shame sits with us for our entire lives; it is a fundamental reason for why so many [[transgender|trans]] people do not come out until their late 30s or later, because only when they reach mid-life are they able to overcome that shame.\n\nShame also tends to build up until it boils over into radical action. A very common aspect among [[transgender|trans]] people’s histories are cycles where they will build up their presentation, fighting their feelings less and less, until suddenly they feel overcome with the shame and purge everything, vowing to never pursue those feelings again. This pattern repeats over and over again.\n\n### Dating and Romantic Relationships \n[I get the thinking. [[transgender|Trans]] girls grow up falsely believing they're guys, and so are assumed/expected/raised to experienced and express normative heterosexual attraction to [[women]]. If you're a [[transgender|trans]] [[Queer|lesbian]], you transition, but you're still into [[women]]. So it's the same, right? No\n](https://twitter.com/Adoratrix/status/1216109204093722630)\n\n[So let's talk details. To begin with, it's worth pointing out that most [[transgender|trans]] lesbians don't exactly experience normative heterosexual attraction to [[women]] in the same way that cishet men do. Dysphoria and confused [[gender]] feelings mess with that a whole lot\n](https://twitter.com/Adoratrix/status/1216109206509694979)\n\n[[[No]] ==Before I transitioned, just the thought of doing any sexual or romantic with a girl made me nauseous, because doing that would feel like I was adopting a masculine role - the role of the boyfriend, the male lover - and that kicked my latent dysphoria into overdrive==\n](https://twitter.com/Adoratrix/status/1216109207671508992)\n\n[When I first transitioned, my family and friends assumed I was going to be solely or primarily interested in men. Every mainstream cultural message I'd ever absorbed about [[women]] (including [[transgender|trans]] [[women]]) told me I needed to be into men\n](https://twitter.com/Adoratrix/status/1216109214994747393)\n\n[Many [[transgender|trans]] healthcare systems operate on a really really crude system where a cis doctor asks you a bunch of stuff like 'what toys did you play with as a child?' to see if you match up well enough with what a woman is \"supposed to be\". And [[women]] are \"supposed to be\" into men\n](https://twitter.com/Adoratrix/status/1216110299285200896)\n\n[So, there's a lot of internal and external pressure faced by [[transgender|trans]] lesbians to disavow their own lesbianism and experience attraction to men. This is nothing like what any straight man experiences, but it is a whole lot like what cis lesbians experience!\n](https://twitter.com/Adoratrix/status/1216110666626555904)\n\n[One last thing is, the way it feels to be a [[transgender|trans]] [[Queer|lesbian]] experiencing attraction, sex and romance to other [[women]]. It doesn't feel like cishet attraction. It's not burdened by any of those weird, crude expectations. I don't recognize any of that in my life\n](https://twitter.com/Adoratrix/status/1216111083997605888)\n\n[[[No]] ==When I read cishet experiences of their sexuality, I feel nothing but alienation. ==When I read [[Queer|lesbian]] experiences, they resonate with me deeply and I recongize those things in how I experience my sexuality with the people I [[love]] and am attracted to\n](https://twitter.com/Adoratrix/status/1216112014411599877)\n\nSocietal Dysphoria _strongly_ comes into play with courtship rituals. Being forced into being the boyfriend or girlfriend when you are not a boy or a girl is extremely disorienting and often feels very unfair. [[Yes]] ==AMABs may find themselves wishing _they_ were the one being pampered==, and AFABs may become uncomfortable with the amount of attention they receive from their prospective partners (beyond the discomfort that [[women]] experience, as this includes genuine attention, not just unwanted attention). The expectations placed on them by their partners to fill these courtship roles may feel like a heavy burden to bear. By contrast, dating as your true [[gender]] becomes euphoric. Buy a [[transgender|trans]] girl flowers and see how much she swoons.\n\nA closeted [[transgender|trans]] person may feel so much pressure to conform to heterosexuality that they suppress their own instincts with regards to relationships and take on a performative role. Many a [[transgender|trans]] woman has attempted to play the role of a heterosexual husband to a wife, only to realize with transition that they would much prefer the role of the wife. They may not even be attracted to [[women]].\n\nBeyond discomfort, many [[transgender|trans]] people realize that the dynamics of relationships that they have experienced simply did not fit the shape of how they appeared. Many [[transgender|trans]] people come to realize after transition that they had never actually dated like a cis person of their assigned [[gender]], instead always having romantic relationships that fit their true orientation. Male to male and female to female relationships have completely different patterns from heterosexual relationships; different courtship rituals, different perceptions, different communication styles. ==Men relate differently to men than they do to [[women]], and [[women]] to [[women]] differently than they do to men, even when they don’t know they are men or [[women]].==\n\nFor example, I myself realized after coming out to my wife that all of my previous dating attempts had absolutely been sapphic in nature. My first order had always been to become good friends with them. Dates would never be labeled as dates because we would just sit and talk somewhere, hanging out together. Consequently, several of my relationships ended simply because I was too scared to make the first move out of destroying the friendship. I would spend half my waking day thinking about them and wanting to be around them, not out of sexual lust, but out of personal infatuation. My first girlfriend straight up told me on our first date that I was unlike any man she’d ever dated because I enjoyed talking instead of just trying to get physical. She broke up with me two months later because I wasn’t as assertive as she wanted from a partner.\n\nThese dynamics get even more complex for [[non-binary]] people, some of whom can at best describe their dating style as [[Queer]]. Some struggle to identify what role they play in a relationship. Others take a specific role that is typically seen as a binary gendered role. Some [[non-binary]] people wish to be seen as a boyfriend/girlfriend, even if they are not a boy/girl. Some want to play a role seen by society as neutral or consisting of aspects from both binary roles.\n","created":"2021-05-10T18:22:56 (UTC -05:00)","tags":[],"source":"https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/societal-dysphoria","author":"Jocelyn Badgley","degree":6,"nameLength":20},"position":{"x":832.7359352533256,"y":382.2236602759195},"group":"nodes","removed":false,"selected":true,"selectable":true,"locked":false,"grabbable":true,"pannable":false,"classes":"note filtered"},{"data":{"id":"core:8 Sexual Dysphoria.md","name":"8 Sexual Dysphoria","path":"00_Meta/Primary Sources/gender-dysphoria-bible/8 Sexual Dysphoria.md","content":"---\ncreated: 2021-05-10T18:22:56 (UTC -05:00)\ntags: []\nsource: https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/sexual-dysphoria\nauthor: Jocelyn Badgley\n---\n\n# How Gender Dysphoria Manifests: Sexual Dysphoria :: That's Gender Dysphoria, FYI\n\n> ## Excerpt\n> Sometimes a Cigar doesn't want to be smoked.\n\n---\nClosely related to Societal Dysphoria is dysphoria centered around sexuality, sexual relationships, and the act of having sex. [Heteronormative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteronormativity) [[gender]] roles come loaded with the expectation that [AMABs will top and AFABs will bottom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top,_bottom_and_versatile). These dynamics get reinforced by our popular [[media]], by toxic masculinity, and especially by our pornography, even in _transgender_ pornography (the bulk of trans/cis pornography involves the [[transgender|trans]] woman topping). [[No]] ==Deviations from these roles often result in shame, both from partners and from peers.==\n\nOf course, this is not an absolute, by any means, and many heterosexual cis couples do find ways out of these molds, finding a new dynamic in their relationship, or engaging in kinks to satisfy desires. Some couples find they aren’t sexually compatible at all and seek other partners. However, there are many many external pressures discouraging this kind of [[self]]-awareness and discovery, and breaking away from those demands can be extremely difficult, even traumatic. This is particularly true when there is a background of [[Conservatism]] or religious virtuism.\n\nCisgender [[Queer|gay]] relationships shirk this by virtue of necessity, opening the doors for individuals to explore what role leaves them more fulfilled. Some [[Queer|gay]] couples have an established dominant/submissive dynamic, and they enter into the relationship with that already understood. Others resolve it by switching up which partner is dominant. Yet, [[Queer|gay]] relationships can still get caught up in these kinds of expectations in regards to [butch/femme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butch_and_femme), [bear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_(gay_culture)), and [twink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twink_(gay_slang)) dynamics.\n\nWhat does all this mean? [[No]] ==[[transgender|Trans]] people who enter into perceptually heterosexual relationships pre-transition sometimes find themselves losing interest in sexual intercourse, as penetrative acts do not produce the fulfillment that they would expect.== In extreme cases it can feel completely wrong and trigger panic. The sensations may feel pleasurable, but the experience is out of place, and the act itself feels forced.\n\nThis can lead to one feeling less enthusiastic or even disinterested in sex, as half of what makes up sex drive is the mental context of the situation. Many [[transgender|trans]] people never even experience sex until adulthood, functionally operating as sex-averse due to how severely their dysphoria has shutdown all sex drive. They may still perform for the sake of their partners, but not get as much enjoyment as they could, and even end up disconnecting from reality around them in order to accomplish the task.\n\nThis dysphoria may be so significant that they find themselves taking a sexual [[self]] that they don’t actually connect with. It is not unheard of for a [[transgender|trans]] person to realize after coming out that they never actually felt a connection to the sexual orientation that they had identified with previously, but were rather using it as a way to feel less dysphoric in their sex lives.\n\nSome [[transgender|trans]] [[women]], for example, identified as [[Queer|gay]] men pre-transition out of a [[desire]] to have a partner that treats them like [[women]] during sex, but find themselves to actually be lesbians once that demand is lifted. Others may attempt to live as [[Queer|gay]] men, but find that the role doesn’t fulfill them because they know their partners see them as men.\n\n**Author's Note**: This specific type of sexual dysphoria is difficult to explain in generalist terms, so I am going to take a departure here and write about this from my own personal experience. The following is presented from my perspective as a binary [[transgender|trans]] woman. As such, this may not be completely relatable to all [[transgender|trans]] people. My apologies.\n\n [![](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/howbaby_swole-23ffa48ee4.png)](http://howbabycomic.com/comic/hb279/) \"Swole Mom\" - How Baby, by Lindsay Ishihiro\n\nThere is a saying that is very well known in sapphic circles: ==“Do I want to be her, or be with her?”==\n\nIt can be hard to tell the difference between sexual attraction and [[envy]], especially when you’re a closeted [[transgender|trans]] teenager. Our entire society is built upon heterosexuality; it is simply the cultural default, to the point that even prepubescent children are barraged with messages about male to female attraction. Consequently, interest in aspects of the lives of the “opposite” sex is almost always immediately perceived as being sexual attraction.\n\nWhat is the result of this? Usually… shame. [[No]] ==[[transgender|Trans]] children often internalize their view of their peers based on their true [[gender]], and one does not objectify their equals==. Thus the child is motivated to hide those interests out of a [[desire]] to not be seen engaging in that kind of sexual objectification. This is even further compounded if the child has been raised in a setting with very strict moral codes, such as in a conservative religious upbringing.\n\nGrowing up as a closeted [[transgender|trans]] teen in an evangelical [[Christianity|Christian]] household, I knew that if I was ever caught looking at [[women]] in what was seen as a sexual manner, I would be punished. I knew if I was ever found handling [[women]]’s apparel, there would be a lot of very awkward questions which I was not prepared to answer. This posed a very serious problem for me, [[Sometimes]] ==as someone with a strong fascination with [[women]]’s apparel, particularly lingerie.==\n\nThere is [a Simpsons clip where Moe Szyslak is put on a lie detector test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQGwrK_yDEg), and by the end of the test he has confessed that he will be spending the night ogling the [[women]] in the intimates section of the Sears catalog. The entire crux of the scene, and the source of the comedy, is the shame that is cast on Moe for engaging in this desperate act of objectification. I grew up knowing that this is how I would be perceived for my interest in [[women]]’s clothing.\n\nOut of shame and fear, I did everything I could to hide this passion, because I simply could not bear for someone to view me like the teenage boys who masturbate to any material they get their hands on. What made this fear even worse was that I _also believed_ that my interest was sexual.\n\nWhen you see the world through a duck shaped lens, everything looks vaguely like a duck. The only framework I had been given to understand my interest in [[women]] was through sexual [[desire]], and thus every feminine interest I had became warped into a sexual [[desire]]. My wish to be a bride morphed into a bridal kink, my [[desire]] to have a child warped into an interest in pregnancy porn, and my own need to be a girl was redirected into a transformation fetish.\n\n[[Sometimes]] ==But on top of all of this, I was _terrified_ to be seen expressing legitimate sexual interest in other [[women]].== I had male friends who were notorious rubberneckers and slack-jawed gawkers; one of my former employers had an awful habit of leering at attractive [[women]] when we were out to lunch, which made me very uncomfortable to be seen with him.\n\nI could not stand to be associated with that male gaze. [[No]] ==Even around the most beautiful [[women]], I would avoid even looking at them, ==because I did not want to be seen as the kind of person that stares at [[women]]. I did not want to be seen as a predator.\n\nThis is the coercive male gaze: [[TO/EXPLORE/READ]]  [compulsory heterosexuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_heterosexuality) placed upon closeted [[transgender|trans]] [[women]] due to heteronormative ideologies. A cognitive dissonance that causes intense [[guilt]] and shame surrounding appreciation of ones peers and gendered interests.\n\nOnce you remove this male framework – once one is able to perceive themselves as female and accept these interests and observations are valid – that shame and [[guilt]] completely evaporates. Even when the interest is sapphic in nature and genuinely includes sexual [[desire]], it is no longer tainted with this layer of objectification. I am able to appreciate the femininity and the beauty of my female peers without judgments, I can compliment them without fearing being perceived as a creep, or having my intentions misinterpreted.\n\nIt was a dysphoria I could not possibly have put into words until after it had finally been relieved. I was even more relieved as I began to integrate into [[Queer]] [[women]]’s spaces and came to realize that _women are exactly as thirsty as men are_, we’re just (usually) much more respectful about it. It was a release of [[guilt]] that I didn’t even know I was carrying.\n","created":"2021-05-10T18:22:56 (UTC -05:00)","tags":[],"source":"https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/sexual-dysphoria","author":"Jocelyn Badgley","degree":5,"nameLength":18},"position":{"x":781.186806752501,"y":432.37993922090817},"group":"nodes","removed":false,"selected":true,"selectable":true,"locked":false,"grabbable":true,"pannable":false,"classes":"note filtered"},{"data":{"id":"core:9 Presentational Dysphoria.md","name":"9 Presentational Dysphoria","path":"00_Meta/Primary Sources/gender-dysphoria-bible/9 Presentational Dysphoria.md","content":"---\ncreated: 2021-05-10T18:22:56 (UTC -05:00)\ntags: []\nsource: https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/presentational-dysphoria\nauthor: Jocelyn Badgley\n---\n\n# How Gender Dysphoria Manifests: Presentational Dysphoria :: That's Gender Dysphoria, FYI\n\n> ## Excerpt\n> Hoodies and sweatpants never go out of style.\n\n---\nClothes. Hair. Makeup. Jewelry. Glasses. Piercings and other body modifications. Even personal hygiene can be a factor of presentation, such as the shaving of body hair, or how you take care of your skin. All of these things are gendered in society, clothing and hair especially.\n\nWhile the sexual [[revolution]] of the 1960s and the [[business]] fashion craze of the 80s did wonders for blurring the gap between masculine and feminine presentation (largely by normalizing masc fashion as androgynous), there are still enormous pressures to conform to traditional [[gender]] norms. [[Gender]] Non-Conforming dress is so instantly marked as [[Queer]] that any time a woman wears a tailored suit she is marked as a [[Queer|lesbian]], and a dad who [puts on an Elsa costume because his son wants to have a Frozen party](https://twitter.com/cbsnews/status/1088441623846023168?lang=en) is labeled as subversive and abusing his child.\n\nLong hair on men has been seen as [an act of rocker rebellion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbAoXw_DqvM) for decades, and men with long hair get discriminated against as being layabouts and bums. Short hair on [[women]] is often read as [[Queer]] or butch (unless they’re old, then it’s expected), and [[women]] are often pressured to keep their hair long. Pierced ears on men became somewhat more normalized in the 90s, but are still seen as an act of rebellion, and some employers won’t allow men to wear earrings. Makeup on men is so stigmatized by toxic masculinity that even men who _like_ makeup feel pressured to avoid it.\n\nLike it or not, presentation is gendered, and it is extremely common for [[transgender|trans]] people to want to present themselves in the fashion of their true [[gender]], and a [[desire]] to be free of the shackles of gendered presentation is common among all [[transgender|trans]] people, regardless of where they sit on the [[gender]] spectrum. For AMAB individuals they may manifest as a wish to incorporate more feminine elements, for AFABs it may manifest as a want for more masculine appearance. This may come as a full push towards the opposite of their assigned [[gender]], or a [[desire]] to seek a middle-ground in pursuit of androgyny. It may even simply be a wish to _not_ present as your assigned [[gender]].\n\n**Not all transfems present feminine, not all transmascs present masculine, not all [[non-binary]] people seek androgyny. Butch AMAB [[transgender|trans]] people are valid, femme AFAB [[transgender|trans]] people are valid. Presentation is not [[gender]], [[gender]] is not presentation.**\n\nPresentational Dysphoria typically appears early on in the form of a fascination with the styling of another [[gender]], and [[Yes]] ==a wish to be able to present as people of that [[gender]] do. ==That [[desire]] may be fulfilled somewhat by seeking out styling that is unisex, but typically that wish is [[self]]-gatekept by statements of “I’m not confident enough to attempt that.” AMABs often run into issue here where this [[desire]] often gets trapped behind heteronormative expectations, causing [[Sometimes]] ==an interest in feminine presentation to be misinterpreted as sexual [[desire]].==\n\nPost-transition Presentational Dysphoria is usually simply a case of high discomfort when attempt to present as one’s assigned [[gender]]. It may not even be about how one looks, but just the way the clothing makes you feel. For the first year and a half of my own transition I could not bear to wear unisex t-shirts because they just made me feel more masculine. Even now I have to cut the collars out of them, because the close neck makes me feel dysphoric.\n\n### Presentation’s Affect on Physical Dysphoria. \n[[[Yes]] ==When you get ready to go, you just roll out of bed and throw on whatever. You don't really do any [[self]]-grooming, or care about what's on your body. You're a little proud of your lack of vanity, your deeper, non-appearance-level existence.==\n](https://twitter.com/NightlingBug/status/1215716435068100611)\n\n[[[Yes]] ==Your clothes are chosen almost entirely for comfort.== And for you, comfortable means loose and baggy. You can't stand wearing clothes (that others claim are flattering!) that are close-fitting in the wrong places, that draw your own attention to certain parts of your body.\n](https://twitter.com/NightlingBug/status/1215716435974066176)\n\n[Clothes shopping for yourself is a hassle at best and a source of stress and [[anxiety]] at worst. When you do find clothes that fit and look okay, they don't make you \\*happy\\*. You don't feel more confident in them. You're just relieved you can go home.\n](https://twitter.com/NightlingBug/status/1215716436980703233)\n\n[Occasions where you \\*must\\* dress up, like weddings and funerals and job interviews, are the worst. Even after all of the grooming and wardrobing, you feel [[self]]-[[conscious]] and awkward in formalwear. It makes you feel \\*fake,\\* like a lump of sludge pretending to be a fancy person.\n](https://twitter.com/NightlingBug/status/1215716438020849664)\n\nClothing can also play a major role in the level of physical dysphoria a person experiences. Men’s clothing is always cut very boxy, straight up and down on the vertical and very square in the horizontal. [[Women]]’s clothing is cut for more curves, accentuating waistlines and hip shape. Men’s pants feature a lower crotch to make room for external genitals, and no fitting for curves, where [[women]]’s bottoms are the opposite. [[Women]]’s clothing is often form fitting, where men’s clothing is rarely form fitting at all. Men’s clothing is often made of sturdier and thicker materials, meant to be worn as a single layer. [[Women]]’s clothing is often made of thinner and stretchier materials, expected to be layered together.\n\nBecause these structures are meant to fit the masculine or feminine forms, they tend to amplify the sensation of wrongness. A classic effect is the way that the difference between men’s and [[women]]’s jeans can have a radical affect on a [[transgender|trans]] person’s comfort level. Unfortunately this works both ways, as even affirming clothing can reveal how your shape is a mismatch.\n\nI, myself am very feminine in my preferred presentation, and I had a longing to wear dresses from when I was just five years old. I abhorred wearing suits, hating the way they fit on my body, since they always tugged in ways that felt very incorrect for what my body needed. I refused to wear any denim for most of my life because men’s jeans always felt so incorrect (women’s jeans and leggings, however, feel amazing). Then as I entered into transition and began to present more female, my dysphoria struck again in the ways my body did not conform to what [[women]]’s clothing was expecting (too much in the crotch, too wide and bulky in the shoulders, too large in the waist, not large enough in the chest). It wasn’t until the second year that I had experienced enough change in my shape to where [[women]]’s clothing was properly affirming of my shape.\n\nWhat does this look like? Well, it looks a lot like other common body image issues. A tendency to avoid anything form fitting, leaning towards softer fabrics and baggier clothes. A classic [[gender dysphoria]] trope is the kid who wears nothing but sweatpants and hoodies. Clothes will be oversized in order to keep them from hugging the body. AFABs may prefer to wear compressing sports bras in order to minimize their chests, and avoid anything with a tight waistline.\n\n[[[Yes]] ==Feeling envious of other girls for being pretty is a thing that many many [[women]] feel. Dysphoria is a real headfuck of a layer on top of that feeling, yet I just wanna say that if you’re a [[transgender|trans]] woman feeling envious of another [[transgender|trans]] ==woman, that’s you being a actual woman.\n](https://twitter.com/DameKraft/status/1191555135756853249)\n\nInternally it most often manifests as intense jealousy of the people you wish you could be. Jealousy over an influencer’s body shape, a strong [[desire]] for the outfit of a person on the street, and most especially [[envy]] of other [[transgender|trans]] people. This feeling often persists well into transition, because this sensation of wanting to be other people of your [[gender]] is actually completely natural, even for cis people.\n\nPresentation can be important for avoiding misgendering, especially early in transition. A lot of [[transgender|trans]] people feel a need to perform their [[gender]] in order to be accepted for who they are, leaning in to feminine or masculine presentation more than they actually would like in order to make up for their body and ensure that people [[gender]] them correctly. Those pursuing medical transition may find this need becomes less important as their bodies change and they become able to be gendered correctly without all of the performance.\n\nPerformative Presentation was practically required prior to the reformation of WPATH in 2011; anyone who showed up to a doctors appointment without extreme feminine or masculine presentation risked be labeled a fake and losing their treatment under the Harry Benjamin Scale. [[transgender|Trans]] [[women]] actually would lose their estrogen simply for wearing jeans and a blouse instead of a dress, or for not putting on enough makeup. This is one of the reasons why [transmedicalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmedicalism) ideology is so dangerous: it would see us returning to this system, labeling anyone who doesn’t meet stereotypical views of femininity and masculinity as not actually [[transgender]].\n\nPresentation is especially important among prepubescent children, as they lack any significant secondary sexual characteristics. Clothing and hair are the only ways we have to show the [[gender]] of a child, so much so that if a baby simply wears a pink shirt, strangers assume it is a girl. Even unisex clothing for kids is strongly gendered by way of colors and graphics. For [[transgender|trans]] children it can be extremely distressing to be either forced to cut their hair, or required to grow it out. Denying dresses to a [[transgender|trans]] girl or transfeminine [[non-binary]] child, or forcing them onto a [[transgender|trans]] boy or transmasculine [[non-binary]] child, can be debilitating to their morale.\n","created":"2021-05-10T18:22:56 (UTC -05:00)","tags":[],"source":"https://genderdysphoria.fyi/gdb/presentational-dysphoria","author":"Jocelyn Badgley","degree":6,"nameLength":26},"position":{"x":814.124653138077,"y":473.9968982092696},"group":"nodes","removed":false,"selected":true,"selectable":true,"locked":false,"grabbable":true,"pannable":false,"classes":"note filtered"},{"data":{"id":"core:I relate to.md","name":"I relate to","path":"00_Meta/Primary Sources/gender-dysphoria-bible/I relate to.md","content":"---\ncreated: 2021-06-11\ntags: node/personal\n---\n# [[Yes]]\n\n- From [[0 That's Gender Dysphoria, FYI]]\n    - still others do not realize that anything is wrong at all until they are fully adults\n- From [[10 Existential Euphoria]]\n    - Sometimes existential dysphoria can manifest existentially, hitting you with all the grief of the youth lost.\n- From [[11 Managed Dysphoria Gender in Disguise]]\n    - Helping cis partners to shop in order to live vicariously through their presentation.\n    - many [[transgender|trans]] people grow up learning to hide their natural personalities out of sheer necessity.\n    - Buying in to ultra-conservative attitudes towards [[gender]] and sexuality.\n    - Intensely investing large amounts of time into hobbies.\n    - Chain binging movies, TV shows or books.\n    - Spending all idle time playing video games or on social [[media]].\n- From [[12 Impostor Syndrome, but make it Trans]]\n    - AMAB Enbies are often either grouped in with [[Queer|gay]] cis men or treated like [[transgender|trans]] [[women]].\n- From [[13 Diagnosing Gender Dysphoria]]\n    - **A strong [[desire]] to be rid of one�s primary and/or secondary sex characteristics**\n    - **A strong [[desire]] for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of another [[gender]]**\n    - **A strong [[desire]] to be of another [[gender]]**\n    - **A strong [[desire]] to be treated as another [[gender]]**\n- From [[2 A Brief History of Gender Dysphoria]]\n    - This incongruence is so deep inside the brain�s subsystems that there is no obvious message of what the problem is.\n- From [[4 Physical Dysphoria]]\n    - Sometimes it may just simply be a feeling of being incorrect, which you may not even attribute to [[gender]] or sex.\n    - It�s okay if you don�t hate anything about your body, and just wish you looked more feminine or masculine.\n- From [[5 Biochemical Dysphoria]]\n    - A sense of detachment or estrangement from your own thoughts, feelings, or body: �I know I have feelings but I don�t feel them�\n    - Feeling as if you have an �unreal� or absent [[self]]: �I have no [[self]]�\n    - Being absorbed in yourself and experiencing a compulsive [[self]]-scrutiny or extreme rumination\n    - Having an ongoing and coherent dialog with yourself\n    - You may put little care into your physical appearance, reaching for only the basic utilitarian needs in clothing and personal hygiene.\n    - You may be unconcerned with the state of your body, perhaps not even fearing death, because you have so little attachment to your life.\n    - You have an underlying sense that you are \"not like\" most people.\n    - Your friends might get you, but you draw an instinctive and unconscious line between you and \"normal\" people.

Moments of sadness or grief cause you to just go numb, dissociated by the event that caused it.\n    - This can also go in the opposite direction, where the person is under so much [[anxiety]] that their emotional response is extremely disproportionate to the catalyst, resulting in severe crying or violent outbursts from seemingly small events.\n- From [[6 Social Dysphoria]]\n    - When you interact with very masculine men, you're nervous.

You feel like your attention is uniquely, universally unwelcome.\n    - When an AFAB friend expresses disapproval, you're devastated. You scramble to get their approval back. You're worried you're coming across as a simpering \"nice guy,\" all of whom you despise. You just value your AFAB friends' opinions more highly, for reasons you can't explain.\n    - They may feel themselves drawn more to friendships with [[women]], but become frustrated at the social and heterosexual dynamics that come into play between men and [[women]], preventing them from forming platonic relationships.\n    - They may find themselves deeply hurt when [[women]] shy away from them on principle.\n- From [[7 Societal Dysphoria]]\n    - For example, many [[transgender|trans]] [[women]] have stories about feeling the need to cover up their chest pre-transition out of an intrinsic sense of modesty.\n    - AMABs may find themselves wishing _they_ were the one being pampered\n- From [[9 Presentational Dysphoria]]\n    - a wish to be able to present as people of that [[gender]] do.\n    - When you get ready to go, you just roll out of bed and throw on whatever.

Dissociating whenever fashion conversations or activities occur.\n    - Expressing [[homophobia]] and Transphobia in [[self]] defense to ward off suspicion.\n    - Aggressively passive engagement in anything connected to one�s true [[gender]].\n    - Long hours spent at work.\n    - Obsessively cleaning one�s living space.\n    - Sleeping. Lots and lots of sleeping.\n- From [[13 Diagnosing Gender Dysphoria]]\n    - **A marked incongruence between one�s experienced/expressed [[gender]] and primary and/or secondary sex characteristics**\n- From [[4 Physical Dysphoria]]\n    - It can manifest as a compulsion to be rid of certain body traits, such as obsessively shaving body or facial hair. This can also manifest in the opposite compulsion, leading to meticulous grooming of those traits in order to try to control them, like maintaining a perfect beard, persistently keeping ones nails manicured and polished, or spending hours in the gym attempting to hone ones shape.\n- From [[5 Biochemical Dysphoria]]\n    - Feeling split into two parts, with one going through the motions of participating in the world and one observing quietly: �There is this body that walks around and somebody else just watches\n    - Experiencing the world as distant, dreamlike, foggy, lifeless, colorless, artificial, like a picture with no depth, or less than real\n    - Lacking a sense of agency � feeling flat, robotic, dead, or like a �zombie�\n    - Inability to imagine things\n    - you may hyperfocus on your appearance, attempting to try to spark some kind of joy, any kind of feeling of pride in your own body, only to be met with more hollowness.\n    - You often feel directionless in life. When asked about career goals in High School, you didn't really care about your answer. Even careers centered in your interests seemed kind of intolerable.\n    - Surroundings that appear distorted, blurry, colorless, two-dimensional or artificial, or a heightened awareness and clarity of your surroundings. Leaves on trees feel like they have extra sharp edges, for example.\n    - Distortions of distance and the size and shape of objects\n    - People with DPDR tend to have a mile long stare as they move about in the world; eyes so gloomy and dead that they look like a shell.\n- From [[6 Social Dysphoria]]\n    - Being vulnerable around strange men is terrifying. You're anxious when you use the public men's room.\n    - Their behaviors and mannerisms feel strange and surprising, where interactions with individuals of your true [[gender]] feel easier.\n- From [[7 Societal Dysphoria]]\n    - Before I transitioned, just the thought of doing any sexual or romantic with a girl made me nauseous, because doing that would feel like I was adopting a masculine role - the role of the boyfriend, the male lover - and that kicked my latent dysphoria into overdrive\n    - When I read cishet experiences of their sexuality, I feel nothing but alienation.\n- From [[8 Sexual Dysphoria]]\n    - Deviations from these roles often result in shame, both from partners and from peers.\n    - [[transgender|Trans]] people who enter into perceptually heterosexual relationships pre-transition sometimes find themselves losing interest in sexual intercourse, as penetrative acts do not produce the fulfillment that they would expect.\n    - [[transgender|Trans]] children often internalize their view of their peers based on their true [[gender]], and one does not objectify their equals\n    - Even around the most beautiful [[women]], I would avoid even looking at them,\n\n# [[Sometimes]]\n\n- From [[11 Managed Dysphoria Gender in Disguise]]\n    - Shaving of body hair, or a refusal to shave hair you�re expected to.\n    - Avoiding social gatherings whenever possible, seeking isolation.\n    - Many [[transgender|trans]] people speak about having a phase of life where they attempted to �buy-in� on their assigned [[gender]], performing masculinity or femininity to extremes in order to try to �fix� themselves\n- From [[13 Diagnosing Gender Dysphoria]]\n    - **A strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions of another [[gender]]**\n- From [[5 Biochemical Dysphoria]]\n    - Feeling like a veil or glass wall separates you from the world\n    - Emotional or physical numbness, such as a feeling of having a head filled with cotton\n    - Being able to think clearly, but feeling as if some essential quality is lacking from your thoughts or experience of the world\n    - A sense of disconnectedness from life, impeding you from creative and open involvement with the world\n    - When someone else is upset, it's much more real and urgent. You believe this is just your stoic, protective nature.\n    - Moving through the world feels like you�re walking on a treadmill, with the buildings moving around you instead of you through them.\n    - Feeling emotionally disconnected from people you care about, as if you were separated by a glass wall, or like they are just actors pretending to be the people they claim to be.\n    - Feeling like a passive observer in the events of your life\n- From [[6 Social Dysphoria]]\n    - Changing in a gym locker room is unthinkable.\n    - Even when your commentary is solicited, everything you could say feels unwanted and inappropriate\n    - For example, an AMAB [[transgender|trans]] person may find themselves very uncomfortable in groups of men. They may feel out of place and struggle to fit in among their male peers.

Was it because of [[ADHD]]? Enduring isn't effiecient? Was it because of [[transgender|trans]]? I was enduring so much? Was it because of [[Autism]]? lack of understanding emotion? #TO/PONDER/ME \n### 2021-10-23 4:10am\nI've started using [[Spaced Repetition (plugin)]] to review the notes in my vault and its been going really well. I'm slowly making progress through my notes. I think it helps a lot with getting notes in my memory so that I can remember them when I need them, but we'll see how that goes as I get through my other 200 notes. I've also been making a lot of updates to my vault. Part of this was just because I discovered the search and replace tool on visual studio code, but it's also because I've just been excited to work in my vault. I've been thinking a lot about the structure (and come to the conclusion that it doesn't really matter), and have made some changes that reduce my stress while in the vault. I'm trying to use my entry points more and keep track of everything, but spaced repetition is the biggest thing.\n\n## August\n### 2021-8-25\nWhat is the use of my intelligence if I can never find the answer? What is the use of my knowledge if I can never apply it? What is the use of my brain if it is riddled with chemical imbalances? I'm scared that one day I will finally realize that [[suicide]] has been the only reasonable option all along. What will happen when I grow tired of searching for the answers? I feel like a mad man. I'm so confused. I'm so incredibly confused and I think that hurts the most to say. What is the point... What is the god damn point.\n\nIf I'm not going to do it. Why? Maybe if I can at least answer that question I will be satisfied. If I can find the reason to continue on I will never need to answer questions again.\n\nI've never wanted to be committed before this moment. I want all control stripped from me. I want to be naked.\n\nI am in a strange state of hyperbolic lucidity. Manic lucidity. Maddening lucidity. I want to throw up\n\nWill you not answer the questions?\n\nAm I dissasociating? Am I just dramatic? Is imagining people reading this after my death the most logical thing to think?\n\nEverything is a lie. Everthing is true\n\npain\n## June\n### 2021-6-11\nMy self-image is purely based on other's perceptions of me\n\nThis is a bit part of [[My relationship with my parents]]. From an early age, [[Self-hatred is born out of dissonance between self-image and self-perception]] caused me to not trust my own experience of the world because as a [[transgender|trans]] person, my [[self-image]] or my gender was wholly different than the [[gender]] that was expected of me.\n\nThis really impacted my [[social anxiety]] because [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]].\n## May\n### 2021-5-31\nYou're never sure you're [[transgender|trans]]. I heard that in a [[tiktok]] today. I don't think you admit that you're [[transgender|trans]]. It's not a decision. You don't even really discover it. You just one day realize that you're a girl, and it makes total sense. That part is so obvious that it doesn't feel real. It feels like a dream that you can't achieve, and the process of achieving it is the difficult part\n### 2021-05-29 6:52 pm\nI seem to have had less [[anxiety]] since I started caring about [[socialization|social interaction]] as much. The reason I was able to care less is because I'm finding more joy in other things I do and I think maybe liking myself a little bit more\n### 2021-05-24\nI felt like my focus wasn't there today. I kept day dreaming about my future and other things while Nick was walking through the code. I was dreaming about my possible conversation with Ron Houston and what I would describe my career goal as. In those thoughts I was thinking about what kind of work would really fulfill me. I was thinking maybe being a consultant who comes in and has to absorb a lot of information fast and solve problems would be good for [[ADHD]] me but not for [[Adderall]] me. Like [[Adderall]] me really wants the overarching picture and to attack the problem from the outside in. What are ALL the inputs, how does EVERTHING work, before getting down to the smallest problem, but I feel like [[ADHD]] me would be better at absorbing needed information quickly and just solving the problem. Still not sure what my dream is, as I'm still questioning the role medication will play in my life. I'm not sure if I should even be on [[Adderall]] or if I'm taking too much. I might try on do a smaller dose tomorrow just to see what happens, but I think I will be sadder then. Not sure. I'm wondering if my problem is really a [[happiness]] thing and not a dopamine thing, or if the [[Adderall]] helps with the dopamine, but [[ADHD]] is not really the cause of it. [[ADHD]] makes sense, but I don't think it's a strong enough fit that other things couldn't be causing the problem. \n### 2021-05-18 7:13 pm\nWhen will I stop telling myself, \"Just endure a little longer, Aaron. It'll be worth it in the end.\"\n\n\"Just endure a few more days, it'll be the weekend soon.\"\n\"Just endure a few more weeks, you'll see your sister soon.\" \n\"Just endure a few more months, your internship will be over soon.\"\n\"Just endure a few more years, your stocks will be vested soon.\" \n\"Just endure a few more decades, your life will be over soon.\"\n\nJust endure a few more days, it'll be the weekend soon.\n\nJust endure a few more months, you'll get a better job soon.\n\nJust endure a few more years, you can retire soon.\n\nJust endure a few more decades, your life will be over soon.\n\n[[The injustice of endurance]]\n### 2021-05-14 12:34 am\nI'm so confused. My brain just feels in a fog. I feel like the fog is emotion. I feel the fog is emotion I don't understand? Or maybe the fog isn't emotion, maybe the fog is my brain trying to find it's way through emotion. I can't think straight. I can't discover the source of this feeling. Why am I happy? Why do I feel like I could talk to people now? What is it about the last five days that has allowed me to feel this way and how do I replicate it? It feels good I think. I feels like I'm making progress, or is this just what my body needs. Is it the isolation and rest that is making me feel again, or is it the exploration of my gender? Or is it the reflection on my past when I was happy. Or is it the validation of my friends saying they [[love]] me. \n\n[[What is my path to happiness]]? \n\nIs what I'm feeling everybody else regular state or is it their hightened state? Because if its their hightened state, that would mean my normal state is normal, and that my feelings of brokeness are made up.\n\nThe genuine want to create and reach out to people feels unnatural because it is out of the norm, but it also feels like comfortable: it feels like it should be normal. \n\nI can't be normal. It shouldnt fell this odd to FEEL. Feeling should be the natural state, not not feeling. Or at least that's what I want it to be.\n\n20 mins later back to feeling not much... Meh\n### May 10-20th 2021\n[[I have a stored up emotion of hating myself]]\nWhen this emotion comes up, the mind rationalizes it away, but the emotion is just stored away ([[Samskara]]: ball of emotion)\n\nI don't know if I'm introspective, maybe I just spend a lot of time rationalizing [[my emotions]] instead of dealing them\n\n\nI've always prided myself on being introspective, but as I watch and Dr. K's sessions and relate to something or see how something may have affected me it triggers my fight or fligh t. I'm starting to think that I'm not introspective, I just spend a lot of time rationalizing [[my emotions]] away instead of dealing with them.\n\n\nI have a similar feeling where even when I'm happy and enjoying myself it feels pointless, because I know that sadness will come again anyways. I think maybe that's why you feel deflated/discouraged. You recognize that your productivity is the outlier not the rule, and you're not confident that it means anything. The fear of never stopping working seems like another thing, but idk what. I don't think either are weird or irrational thoughts though. \n\n\nThe thought of idk how much pain im feeling/idk why im crying comes from [[my parents]] always discounting my crying by saying i have a fast cry trigger but I think that made me think that [[my emotions]] weren't natural and so I hid them and shut them off\n\n#TO/PONDERED/ME (yeah you're just trans hun 10/25/2021) Because I had so much trouble controlling [[my emotions]] as a child, I still view emotionality as weakness and there might be some misogyny there???? \n\nI isolate myself when I am sad or depressed because I am used to [[my emotions]] being invalidated. Did I say I don't know why I'm crying so often because if I said how I felt [[my emotions]] were invalidated or just because I actually didn't know? Why I am constantly searching for validation? What the fuck is even being validated? I never got an answer for why I was crying, so I just stopped crying. \n\nI'm never vulnerable, everything is always calculated.\n\nI never allow myself to be vulnerable, I only do it when I forced to be.\n\nDo I wanna be the girl or do I just want the [[emotional validation]] that girls get?\n\nis it okay to want [[emotional validation]]? Do I want validation from people I know or people I don't know?\n\n#TO/PONDERED/ME ([[You can be taught to invalidate your own emotions]])   [[Emotional validation]] has been on my mind a lot recently. It feels like a lot of my worse behaviors are built around [[emotional validation]]. I cut myself off and refuse to reach out for help because I afraid that [[my emotions]] won't be validated. Of course this is a never ending circle \n\n#TO/PONDERED/ME (it's [[masking]], lol 7/29/21 also you're autistic dumbass 10/25/21) Do I get tired of human interactions over time because I am an introvert or is the there a deeper meaning?\n### April 2 \nTo [[my parents]], //My [[trauma]] manifesto\n\nI loved you. I always loved you, from the day I saw your faces. I don't remember it, most kids don't, but I know I loved you. I don't [[love]] you anymore. I know it hurts to read, and I wish it hurt more to say. Turn away if you want. I can't hold back any longer. I can't coddle your feelings. You hurt me. Whether you like to admit it or not, whether you remember doing it or not, whether you believe you didn't or not. The [[purpose]] of my entire life has been to please you. I was never [[Christianity|christian]]. I pleased [[my parents]]. I was never a good student. I pleased [[my parents]]. I was never happy. I pleased [[my parents]]. \n\nIs this hyperbole? yes. Is it how I really feel? yes. You guys got lucky. You got a really smart kid. All your kids are smart, but ==only one had two examples of what not to do.== [^1] What not to do if you want to avoid that disapproving tone that strikes fear into our hearts to this day. You didn't have to beat me, ==I wish you did==. [[To my parents#^ea7957]] I wish I could have realized earlier that there was no [[purpose]] in pleasing you. But how could I have known. How could I have known that ==who I was== [^3] would forever bar me from your [[love]]. I should have known that something about me that I couldn't change would be the reason that I would fail, because I changed everything else. Why do I have [[anxiety]]? because I see everything. Why do I hate myself for being [[Queer|gay]]? because I see everything. Why do I feel like the only thing that can make my life worth living is SAVING EVERYONE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD? because I see everything. ==Every disapproving stare==, [[To my parents#^14d024]]==every haughty laugh==, [^5] every pained face, every face with dried tears, every look of disdain, EVERY THING. I saw it all and I took it to heart. Everything was categorized: approved or not approved. If it was approved I strived for it. I made it part of my [[self]] worth. Why is every single part of my personality because of you? If it was disapproved of I shunned it. I buried it so deep inside of me that even I couldn't find it anymore. Thank god I'm smart enough not to send this. \n\n[^1]: I viewed myself as the best version of the brother a sister, even said it out loud for years ^8e0501\n- I feel like it would be easier to admit and understand [[trauma]] that comes from a more common source ^ea7957\n- being [[Queer|bisexual]]\n- common from both [[parents]] ^14d024\n- more common from mom than dad \n\nEventually I buried so many things I thought I couldn't be saved. I started to get confused about what was a lie and what was me. How could I ever know if I was saved? I didn't know what I really thought, I didn't know if I was genuine or not because EVERYTHING I DID WAS TO PLEASE YOU. when I realized I couldn't do it anymore I gave up. I gave up trying, but I didn't give up hoping. I kept up appearances, because maybe I could do it. Maybe I could be the golden child. I failed. Eventually the facade started to slip. I started to realise I was happier when it did. I wanted to be honest with you but I was scared. Scared of the things that I had built my life to avoid. I learned how to manipulate so well I don't even know when I'm not. I don't know if I'll ever know if I'm genuine.\n\nI don't know if I'll be able to work through this with you. For me this is freeing, but I don't know what itll be. I hope that deep down you've realized that maybe you made a mistake.\n\nWhy do I never reach out for help. I had to reach the point of emotional breakdown, on top of years of effort, just to give my Aunt a call. Why am I trained to keep it inside. I've always kept it inside. I could barely speak when I called her. I sounded like a driveling idiot. In your house that would have been an offence I wouldn't have allowed. I wouldn't have let that out. You wired my brain to be that way. You broke my brain. It's no surprise it took me so long to realize I had [[ADHD]]. In evolutionary theory, people with [[ADHD]] would have been the hunters. People whose brains were fast enough that they could be aware of every threat. Be aware of every opportunity of success. I was on the hunt, but really I was being hunted. I had so much going on that I needed that extra brain power. It wasn't until I was alone in my room with nothing to be afraid of that it was too much.\n\n21 years its taken me to figure myself out.\n\n[[Empathy]] first. I had [[empathy]] for you when Grandma died. It’s seared into my memory. I can remember it plain as day. It wasn't traumatic, but I think it changed me. I saw you grieving, I felt your pain. How I don't know but the brain is powerful and children's brains especially. Maybe I decided that I never wanted you to hurt that way because of me. Maybe I didn't understand it that well. I don't know\n\nMy childhood is a blur, I have memories but very few are strong. There's too many things to remember I suppose.\n\nI can't believe [[my parents]]. My trust for them is broken. Too many lines crossed, too many problems disregarded. If you really loved me, it would be easy. There'd be nothing that could stand between you loving your child. No peace of [[theology]], no few verses in the bible, no single word in a single verse that was mistranslated in 1946. I know you think you [[love]] me. But you have to [[love]] all of me. and you have to like it. I can't compromise. I have my entire life.\n\nI wish I could go back and not be [[Queer|bisexual]]. (this spawned a whole tangential brain tangent that I didn't write down) if that happened I wouldn't be writing this. I would be confused still. I probably would never address my [[trauma]]. Because being [[Queer|gay]] wasn't the reason I never felt loved. You didn't know, how could you, I hid it so well. I would still have [[anxiety]], I would still be depressed, I would still feel the weight of the world on my shoulders. I would have still have based every part of my life off of pleasing you. I just would have never realized it. Something about christianitys obsession with gayness never sat right with me. It was the start of it all, my walk away from the church, from my [[faith]], and finally from you. It is so incredibly illogical. It has no reason except embed hatred in the very nature of [[christianity]]. It’s not a sin. It was never a sin. But it took the realm of sin away from action and into lifestyle.  How could you not hate people that LIVED A LIFE OF SIN. And once you hate one group of people for something they can't change it becomes a whole lot easier to hate other groups for the reasons they can't change. Who cares about poor people, it's their choice. Who cares about [[black people]], it's their choice. Who cares about [[Queer|gay]] people, it’s their choice.\n\nI can't bottle this up. I will be dealing with this for the rest of my life. I have been dealing with it for my entire life. I just understand it better now.\n\nI don't know if I'm right. Maybe I'm delusional. But I have to understand why I feel the way that I feel. it has to come from something. there is an explanation. maybe i've found it, but i don't know if i'll ever convince myself I have. I will live it. I will work through it. but it will never leave me.\n\n# 2020\n\n## April\n\n### 4/22/20 1:57am \nMy understanding of humans and their interactions comes mainly from observation and extensive analysis which means that if I am put into a situation that I have not dealt with before I have very little ability to adapt, unless the situation can be broken down into smaller little interaction nuggets which I have dealt with before. \n## March\n\n### 3/28/20 1:17am \nCouple weeks into coronavirus quarantine. The loneliness is hitting hard, but I don't know if this is really because of the quarantine. I feel like I'm on the edge of the [[depression]] from last semester. I feel like the progress I've made is slowly slipping away. I feel like I'm becoming the person I was a few months ago, the one that was just okay, not the one that is improving. The worst part is I don't know how to stop it. I don't really know what I need to do to feel better. Maybe being creative will help, I can certainly try. \n\n### 3/13/20 12:37am \nThe despair feels like it's hitting tonight. Life was going great, but it feels like I just got to a big cliff on the way up the mountain. I think I'll get up this cliff, I know I'll get up this cliff, but I dont know how long it will take, I don't know how hard it will be, and I don't know how much pain it will cause me. Coronavirus is sweeping the nation, not actually sweeping, just the fear mainly, and man is it fucking with stuff. I thought that a whole lot of other things would get in my way, but I never thought it would be a fucking virus. It's not so bad yet, my [[mental health]], but I can feel it getting worse, regressing back to what it was. I'm not sure if I'll be able to change things, now that I'm back in my old situation, but I hope I can. I hope you'll get some happy posts sometime journal, but I don't know when. \n### 3/12/20 1:30am \nI've just watched a video that resonated so deeply with me, that desperately want to find someone who can understand it. Unfortunately I feel it is so nice, and requires so much context to understand that any attempt to reach out and find a mutual audience for this video wouldn't result in me being seen as an outcast. \nI definitely feel like I am still figuring my life out, my brain out, my [[soul]] (? maybe [[conscious]]) out. I don't feel mentally stable, every day I could slip back into [[depression]], or bad habits. I have so many things that I want to do, but I feel like the world is always getting in my way. The better times get, the more I regret the past times that could've been better. Hopefully one day I get past that. It's interesting that I don't currently long for any past time. I feel like I'm at the peak of my life and the lowest point of my life at the same time, which means that I am currently on the slog up the hill to my peak, and the pain now is just the hard work to get there. Damn, that's the best thing to come out of these journal entries. I just shed a tear. \nI think mentally unhealthy people are easier to get into deep conversations with. Or maybe just people who are still working on their mental state. \n\n### 3/7/20 10:30pm \nIt's okay to regret. Its okay to be sad. It's to improve yourself it's okay to get better. Even though it hurts. Even though every good time just makes all the bad times seem worse. Even though every bad time feels like it will last forever. Everybody has experiences that they regret. Everybody has times in their life that weren't as good. Everybody takes on life in a different way. \n\n## February\n\n### 2/6/20 11:45pm \nI am feeling quite introspective tonight. I watched a youtuber who I haven't watched in a while. I expected his videos to make me feel sad and purposeless, but they made reavaluate my current spot in life. He struggled with living reactionarily, but reoriented his life to focus on what he valued. That brings the question, what do I value. \nThat is a very hard question for me, as I do not have a solid [[purpose]] for living. The best I can think of is bringing [[happiness]] to myself and others, but that still feels like it's lacking something important, I just can't place my finger on it. \nWhat is the [[purpose]] of my life? \nRecently I have been living my life in a reactionary way. Minecraft provided me with joy and dopamine so I started playing it again, but what is playing advancing? It does improve my mood often and provide me with some temporary [[purpose]], but this is not lasting. I am spending quality time with Kire, which is important to do. He is my best friend and I think I am in some way improving his life. It is also detrimental to my schoolwork, but that has not proven serious as of yet. Really it is general apathy and laziness that hold the most danger for my school work \nI've decided to start writing this diary. Perhaps it will help me find something, or just put something into words, or maybe I'll wake up tommorow and be to apathetic to continue on the goals I set tonight. I uninstalled Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Reddit. Not because they were really detrimental to my life, but because they allowed and escape that I was taking part in much to regularly.

Sleepovers, camping trips, girl/boy scouts, shopping trips, cheerleading or sports. Events that are co-ed may have very different feelings attached to them based on how you engage with them, like going to prom, religious ceremonies (such as having a bat mitzvah instead of a bar mitzvah), and even just the act of courtship. This dysphoria may also be biological in origin, such as a sorrow over having not given birth to or breastfed your children.\n                \n---\n\nThese missed opportunities can manifest as feelings of loss and hurt. Furthermore, the memories of things you _did_ have access to but wouldn’t have otherwise, or events that were performed in the wrong [[gender]], can also be a sour point, as these may have awkward attachments. Imagine having to be a groom at your wedding when you know you should have been a bride; growing up dreaming about your perfect wedding, and then playing the wrong role in it.","edgeCount":3},"position":{"x":0,"y":0},"group":"edges","removed":false,"selected":false,"selectable":true,"locked":false,"grabbable":true,"pannable":true,"classes":"inline"},{"data":{"id":"core:10 Existential Euphoria.md->core:transgender.md1","source":"core:10 Existential Euphoria.md","target":"core:transgender.md","context":"Many [[transgender|trans]] people attempt to recapture some of these lost events, hosting or attending [[Queer]] proms, organizing sleepovers, performing vow renewals with their spouses, and engaging in common puberty rites of passage like having a mother figure help them shop for their first bra, or having a father figure teach them to shave.

If you keep returning to these thoughts over and over again, this is your brain telling you that you took a wrong turn.\n                \n---\n\nThe world is _full_ of influences put in place to fill us with doubt and keep us from breaking outside of the established social order.

The message of “oh you just don’t want to be a woman because of how [[women]] are treated” is far too often heard, and it can deeply infest your [[subconscious]] to the point of [[self]] doubt. But this doesn’t make much sense, because if you’re AFAB and not a woman, that makes you [[transgender]]. And on average, society treats [[transgender]] folks worse than [[women]]. So transitioning to escape systemic oppression is a dumb concept (and I personally have never met a [[transgender|trans]] person who has done this).\n                \n---\n\nYou can just be genderqueer! Your [[self]] is valid!\n                \n---\n\nThis one hits _everybody_. Transmedicalism (aka Truetrans) is a [[transgender]] ideology derived from the Harry Benjamin scale (ranks 5 and 6). It seeks to reinforce the pre-WPATH rules, requiring intense physical dysphoria, demanding medical transition, and often invalidating all [[non-binary]] identities. At its core, transmedicalism is a supremacist concept, elevating binary [[transgender|trans]] people above the needs of any other [[gender identity]], and a push back against the expansion of the [[transgender]] [[self]]. They wish for more gatekeeping than we have today, rail against enbies using the [[transgender]] label, and would prefer to see fewer people receive treatment for their [[gender dysphoria]].\n                \n---\n\nIf a [[transgender|trans]] person’s first exposure to transness is a transmedicalist, this can severely set back their own [[self]]-acceptance and push them even further into the closet.

The vast majority of resources for birth are _extremely_ female gendered, so just the very process of conceiving, carrying, and giving birth is exceptionally loaded with [[gender]] expectations. If you are pregnant then you are labeled a mom, regardless of how you actually feel about your role, and with that comes a whole load of assumptions. Assumptions about caregiving, breastfeeding, and child rearing.\n                \n---\n\nSome unexpected ways that Societal Dysphoria can appear are in the need to conform to the social standards of your true [[gender]]. [[Yes]] ==For example, many [[transgender|trans]] [[women]] have stories about feeling the need to cover up their chest pre-transition out of an intrinsic sense of modesty.== A discomfort at swimming topless is a common trait, even when there is no understanding of one’s true [[self]]; something just knows.\n                \n---\n\nFailure to live up to these roles can manifest _intensely_ as shame and humiliation.

A father may be disappointed that their AMAB child isn’t willing to engage in sports or other masculine activities. Female peers may demonstrate disapproval of an AFAB teenager choosing to hang out with a male social circle. Teen boys may ostracize an AMAB [[transgender|trans]] person who doesn’t join in with their humor.\n                \n---\n\n[So let's talk details. To begin with, it's worth pointing out that most [[transgender|trans]] lesbians don't exactly experience normative heterosexual attraction to [[women]] in the same way that cishet men do. Dysphoria and confused [[gender]] feelings mess with that a whole lot\n                \n---\n\nSocietal Dysphoria _strongly_ comes into play with courtship rituals. Being forced into being the boyfriend or girlfriend when you are not a boy or a girl is extremely disorienting and often feels very unfair. [[Yes]] ==AMABs may find themselves wishing _they_ were the one being pampered==, and AFABs may become uncomfortable with the amount of attention they receive from their prospective partners (beyond the discomfort that [[women]] experience, as this includes genuine attention, not just unwanted attention). The expectations placed on them by their partners to fill these courtship roles may feel like a heavy burden to bear. By contrast, dating as your true [[gender]] becomes euphoric. Buy a [[transgender|trans]] girl flowers and see how much she swoons.\n                \n---\n\nBeyond discomfort, many [[transgender|trans]] people realize that the dynamics of relationships that they have experienced simply did not fit the shape of how they appeared. Many [[transgender|trans]] people come to realize after transition that they had never actually dated like a cis person of their assigned [[gender]], instead always having romantic relationships that fit their true orientation. Male to male and female to female relationships have completely different patterns from heterosexual relationships; different courtship rituals, different perceptions, different communication styles. ==Men relate differently to men than they do to [[women]], and [[women]] to [[women]] differently than they do to men, even when they don’t know they are men or [[women]].==","edgeCount":9},"position":{"x":0,"y":0},"group":"edges","removed":false,"selected":false,"selectable":true,"locked":false,"grabbable":true,"pannable":true,"classes":"inline"},{"data":{"id":"core:7 Societal Dysphoria.md->core:transgender.md1","source":"core:7 Societal Dysphoria.md","target":"core:transgender.md","context":"Some unexpected ways that Societal Dysphoria can appear are in the need to conform to the social standards of your true [[gender]].

A gift to be cherished, not a curse to be hidden.\n                \n---\n\nThe shame becomes especially intense at the moment of revealing themselves to be [[transgender|trans]]. Transphobic friends and family having negative, sometimes even violent reactions to a [[transgender|trans]] person coming out of the closet converts that shame into extreme [[guilt]] and disgrace. An adult [[transgender|trans]] person in a marriage may feel a tremendous amount of remorse at upending their spouse’s life by revealing themselves.
