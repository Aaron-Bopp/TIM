I still practiced [[Christianity]] (Christian school, going to church, etc.) until I was 19, because I was too scared of [[my parents]] reactions. I lied for four years straight, for really no benefit because I forced myself to live a lie for years and when I did tell them it was still [[religious trauma| traumatic]]: [[Fear cannot be a deterrent for deconstructing your faith]]\n\nIt took me two years of complete separation from the church and [[my parents]] on top of four years of not being a [[Christianity|Christian]] before I felt like I could look at [[Christianity]] objectively, because [[Deconstructing your faith is like climbing through a jungle canopy]]. It was only when I was able to reach the top that I made the realizations about God \n^[[[The biblical Christian God is evil and does not deserve to be worshipped]]]\n that made me confident enough to be an [[atheism|atheist]].\n\nOne of my most major issues with the church is that [[Non-faith issues have been co-opted to keep people in the Christian church]]. This is part of the reason why I believe [[You can leave the church without loosing your faith]], and why [[My worldview is not about conversion it is about acceptance]]. But I think it is also very important to note [[The church will fail if christians keep aligning themselves with hate instead of love]].\n\nDespite all that I still think [[Faith can be a useful tool for grounding yourself]].

You have no idea where to look for food. You don't remember where you got food before, you don't know where food would be now. So you make a decision to start walking in a direction and looking for food, and low and behold you find some. You decide that the reason you walked this direction was because there was a bush. So the next time you look for a food, you look for a bush.\n\nThe problem is you did not walk in that direction because there was a bush. You did not think about the bush, you just went. You had zero inputs and yet you still had an output, and when that output lead to a conclusion, you deduced inputs for your output. You decided that the bush was the reason you walked in that direction. This is a fallacy, the bush was not the reason, and yet you believe it is, and in the future you will work off of this fallacy. This is fundamentally illogical, and yet it is the reason behind [[human advancement]].\n\nWhen you explained that the bush was the reason you found the food, you [[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things|explained an unexplainable thing]]. You had no true reason, but if you hadn't made that decision, you would have starved to death: [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]], even make impossible choices.\n\nSay that the next day you go out with some other prehistoric human to get food, but they decide to go in a different direction. You think, \"there is no bush, this useless,\" and yet you shortly find food. However, instead of deciding that the bush has nothing to do with the food, you walk across the next hill certain that you will find a bush, because [[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]].\nAcross the hill you find a bush! Aha! If we had walked the other way, the bush would have led us here, and this statement is logical. If you had been walking the other way, you would have seen the bush and found the food, but that does not prove that bushes lead to food. You use your conclusion to prove your hypothesis. Logic built off fallacy. \n\n##### Humans are emotional\n\n#TO/TEND/CONNECT \n- [[Complex emotions are intellectual understandings of primal urges]]\n\t- [[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]]\n\t- [[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]]\n\t\t\n\n##### Humans are irrational\n\n- It is more specifically described as an action or opinion given through inadequate use of reason, or through emotional distress or cognitive deficiency. Irrational behaviors of individuals include:\n    - taking offense or becoming angry about a situation that has not yet occurred\n    - expressing emotions exaggeratedly (such as crying hysterically)\n    - maintaining unrealistic expectations\n    - engaging in irresponsible conduct such as problem intoxication\n    - disorganization\n    - falling victim to confidence tricks\n\nThese more contemporary normative conceptions of what constitutes a manifestation of irrationality are difficult to demonstrate empirically because it is not clear by whose standards we are to judge the behavior rational or irrational.

Often these were just the sort of objects that anthropologists would later find being used as ‘primitive currencies’ all over the world. Surely this must prove capitalism in some form or another has always existed? The logic is perfectly circular. If precious objects were moving long distances, this is evidence of ‘trade’ and, if trade occurred, it must have taken some sort of commercial form; therefore, the fact that, say, 3,000 years ago Baltic amber found its way to the Mediterranean, or shells from the Gulf of Mexico were transported to Ohio, is proof that we are in the presence of some embryonic form of market economy.
