#### [[Religion creates social order through group membership and ritual]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

- part of:: [[What maintains our social order]]
- explained by:: [[Symbolism increases human's capacity for cooperation]]
- explains:: [[Religion promotes high social control]]

This was proposed by [[Emile Durkheim]] as a [[functionalism|functionalist]] explanation for [[religious belief]].
Religion would support beliefs and practices in line with the sacred 
^[**sacred** - worthy of respect or dedication ]
and spurn ones related with the profane
^[**profane** - corrupt morally or by intemperance or sensuality]
and would in this way create the group cohesiveness needed for [[social order]].

An example of this is the ritual around electing a King in [[Gabon]] (1868)
