> [!wikipedia] [Testing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing%20effect)

> The testing effect (also known as retrieval practice, active recall, practice testing, or test-enhanced learning)  suggests long-term memory is increased when some of the learning period is devoted to retrieving information from memory. It is different from more general practice effect, defined in the APA Dictionary of Psychology as "any change or improvement that results from practice or repetition of task items or activities."Cognitive psychologists are working with educators to look at how to take advantage of testsâ€”not as an assessment tool, but as a teaching tools  as testing prior knowledge is more beneficial for learning when compared to reading or passively studying material, even more so when the test is more challenging for memory.
