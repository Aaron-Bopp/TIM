#### [[Religion as a solution to existential dread]]

answers:: [[What is the origin of religion]]

This can be both a [[consciousness|conscious]] and an [[unconscious]] choice.
[[Wonder motivates us to interact with the world around us]] could naturally lead to this,
or it could be what you choose because [[Humans are addicted to believing]].

This was the main aspect of [[religion]] that I missed, 
and I interpreted it as [[Faith can be a useful tool for grounding yourself]].
Faith doesn't have to be [[religious belief]],
but religion is the best at systematizing it and spreading it.
