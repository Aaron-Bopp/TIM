#  Introduction

Minecraft is a wildly popular video game, created by Markus "Notch" Persson and later developed by Mojang. Released in 2011, Minecraft originated as a PC game, but its code was later adapted to iOS, Android, Microsoft Xbox, Sony PlayStation, Nintendo WiiU, as well as other platforms. In this paper, I will explore analogies and reifications of religious violence in a public multiplayer anarchy server of Minecraft, named 2b2t.[^1] Before that is done, though, it is necessary to unpack what each of those words means. After doing this, I will explore three manners in which religiosity manifests in the server. These three manners are unironic, ironic, and analogous. Thereafter I will examine the role that violence plays in the religious ideology of 2b2t. This analysis will argue (1) that [[religion]] is better understood as an interpretation of reality than as a construction of order, and (2) that violence is integral to the religious fervor of 2b2t's culture and reality.

# What is Minecraft?

Minecraft's "sandbox" style allows players to randomly generate their own unique worlds (called 'seeds'), either in single player, in a private server with friends, or in public multiplayer servers. But, unlike most other video games, Minecraft utterly lacks a storyline. Though credits roll after beating the Ender dragon in the realm called, the End, there is no storyline, no plot, no canonical goal that Minecraft sets out for the player. The player can build for her whole life, she can destroy whatever she wants, she can explore, she can define her own goals. In this way, Minecraft has no rules, only physics.

At first glance, this does not appear to have anything to do with [[religion]], much less religious violence. In an anarchy server called 2b2t, however, we see that religious violence can manifest even in an environment as nihilistic as Minecraft precisely because it functions as a microcosm of the real world.

# What is 2b2t?

Multiplayer servers are perhaps some of the livelier aspects of Minecraft. The relative simplicity of Minecraft code makes it rather easy to modify for public consumption. Many public multiplayer servers utilize modifications (mods) that create rules, parameters, and custom blocks and terrain that otherwise are not a part of "vanilla"[^2] Minecraft. There are countless iterations of Minecraft mini-games and colosseum-style player-versus-player (PvP) battles, often created by players using third-party modifications. However, in contrast to the vast majority of online servers which fabricate order out Minecraft's inherently anarchic framework, there are also online anarchy servers.

The exact definition of "anarchy" servers is contested even among serious Minecraft players. Generally, however, anarchy servers have scarce or no server-wide rules. One rule an anarchy server might employ is "do not do anything that would break the server." In most cases, a player would have to go out of their way to do something that violates that rule, like creating extremely effective lag machines[^3] or force OPing oneself.[^4] Because it is minimally restrictive, the rule has no real import for most players. 2b2t has a "rule" like this, but given its extreme nature it is infrequently enforced. Sometimes if the rule is violated, however, the owner of the server, HauseMaster, simply fixes the abnormalities (e.g. world-editing out the problem lag machine(s) or reverting a player back to survival mode). There are no meta-game punishments (like banning or temp banning). In its earliest days, 2b2t "started to be advertised on 4chan almost daily"[^5] and the anarchic element appealed to many, especially on the boards /v/ and /b/, because of their affinity for freedom of speech.

All players initially spawn in the same general area (around 500 blocks around x: 0, y: 64, z: 0).[^6] Spawn thus experiences the highest level of traffic on the server and is notoriously the biggest target for mass killings (incursions). So much that it is very difficult for the average player to 1) escape spawn (with its deadly drops, lava walls[^7], cobble monsters and lava casts[^8], cobblestone mazes[^9], obsidian walls[^10], and Withers[^11]) and 2) travel far enough away from spawn where they can find food, without using a hack client, like Impact or Wurst. These clients enable a player to avoid starving (using 'anti-hunger') and travel faster than possible in vanilla Minecraft (using speed hacks).

Owen Gottlieb rightly observes that "it would be very challenging to effectively research and analyze behavior inside of Minecraft without ever having mined and crafted."[^12] This is true for vanilla Minecraft no doubt, and it is especially true for the likes of 2b2t. Players can install hack clients to their computers to defy game physics. In anarchy servers, hack clients are not only allowed, but they are often encouraged to ensure survival and accelerate creation or destruction. Such is the case of 2b2t.

"Minecraft is understood," Gottlieb continues, "as part of a wider world, which, like any other part, requires a clear agreed upon system of fair play."[^13] However, the nature of anarchy servers suggests exactly the opposite. In the case of 2b2t, the wider world of Minecraft eschews any modicum of a "system of fair play." There may be temporary social contracts, but they are certainly not "clear" or systematic. At the very most, there is a sort of natural law, as if Catholic theological ethics took a vulgar anarchic turn. For example, one 2b2t player, RedGoner, writes that:

> The laws of the land \[of 2b2t\] aren\'t the laws that any player wrote up and started enforcing; they\'re laws of the land that exist because of the test of time. Time after time, some things have held true throughout, even despite anyone\'s efforts to change them; just as is the nature of anarchy. The laws go a little something like this: if you want to make it somewhere on 2b2t, you\'ve got to go through adversity and challenges without giving up; there\'s no such thing as 'fair'; safety is never something that can be assured, ever; anything can happen, at all times; garbage is everywhere you look.[^14]

Of course, this rejection of [[fairness]] means Minecraft's "sandbox" style becomes even more real. Anything can happen to you or your build at any point. Thus, players build with the expectation that it will one day be found and destroyed (aka 'griefed'), accepting the temperance of the world, like the contemporary [[Christianity|Christian]] song which sings "All I know is I'm not home yet. This is not where I belong."[^15] Doctrzombie, FitMC, and other prominent players in 2b2t call this "the Sandcastle Mentality." This mentality says that "nothing is forever and you should live your 'life' on the server knowing that it could all be swept away in a moment. That everything we do is temporary and you should not only deal with that reality, but exemplify it in your deeds and revel in it. That the destruction of your base should have as much meaning as it\'s \[sic\] creation."[^16]

# Religious Studies as Heuristic

Given the chaotic nature of this subject matter, it is tempting to water down the anarchic nature of 2b2t by describing it in a structured format. However, it is equally as easy to write rather disjointedly, thereby remaining unintelligible to any reader unfamiliar with 2b2t. Thus, rather than using religious studies as a narrativizing enterprise, I will be using it as a heuristic and the host of heurisms.

The problem of definitions is not solved by giving, once and for all, the "best" definition of [[religion]] (or any other word). On the contrary, the problem of definitions continues ad infinitum and ad nauseum when words are treated as empirical correspondents to the essence of things in the world. If you were to ask me to give a definition of "[[religion]]" and I respond, hypothetically, "a community of shared and ritualized metaphysical beliefs," you could then ask me to give a definition of each word in the definition---community, shared, metaphysical, beliefs.

The endless and unproductive onslaught of definitions nudges us, instead, toward a heuristic approach---a hermeneutic of [[religion]] through which we can use to understand a part of what is going on in an environment like 2b2t. While this approach is required by the anarchic nature of my subject matter, the heuristic approach also provides key insight to religious studies as a discipline as well. My heuristic coincides with Rachel Wagner's four-fold paradigm of [[religion]] and gaming, insofar as I explore *[[religion]] in gaming* and *gaming as [[religion]]*.[^17]

In this heuristic formulation of religious studies, we can find help in the work of Gilles Deleuze & Guattari. In *A Thousand Plateaus*, Deleuze & Guattari develop a philosophical tool called the rhizome, appropriated from botany. In botany, a rhizome is "a horizontally creeping underground stem which bears roots and leaves and usually persists from season to season."[^18] One common example of a rhizome in botany is the bamboo plant. Deleuze & Guattari describe their appropriation of the rhizome thusly:

> A rhizome...is characterized by 'ceaselessly established connections between semiotic chains, organizations of power, and circumstances relative to the arts, sciences, and social struggles.'...Rather than narrativize history and culture, the rhizome presents history and culture as a map or wide array of attractions and influences with no specific origin or genesis, for a 'rhizome has no beginning or end; it is always in the middle, between things, interbeing, intermezzo.'[^19]

Thomas Tweed, borrowing conceptually from another work of Deleuze & Guattari's, write that "there is no omnilateral position. So there is no omnispection, and certainly not as we turn the gaze back on ourselves. Our sightings of our own shifting position are always partial. A cloud of sand and rain blows up and obscures our view."[^20]

A rhizomatic approach to [[religion]] is helpful because, like Tweed, it "assiduously resist\[s\] all attempts to speculate about origins" or narrativize [[religion]] by attempting to define it in an essentialist manner.[^21] The rhizomatic approach to [[religion]], instead, accepts the parameters we are faced with so we may begin to map out an area given our familiarity with the landscape.

Because there is no language (real or hypothetical) that can be used universally across all things we would commonly call religions, scholars of [[religion]] should be using languages of the religions we study while understanding the histories and cultures in which they find themselves. In agreement with Rachel Wagner, scholars of [[religion]] and gaming should be "listening to players' articulation of their own experiences, as well as drawing on historical approaches to observe trends and to understand contexts, we can perform careful case studies that are representation of the key connections between [[religion]] and play."[^22]

The struggle to speak broadly about [[religion]], or even define it in a scientifically rigorous manner, reflects the modernist impulses scholars still carry which are unproductive to understanding religions in their specificity. Broad definitions, like world maps, lack many details that would otherwise be helpful in a given locality. Likewise, atomistic definitions tell us only about the locality (and perhaps not even this much if it is too atomistic), not necessarily the world abroad, but they may give us insight into how neighboring localities are lain.

Rachel Wagner argues that "humans seek order, meaning, and [[purpose]]---and [[religion]] and gaming are two of the places we most often turn for these comforts."[^23] Similarly Gregory Price Grieve argues, following Roger Callois, that "play and [[religion]] are similar because in both, people are 'removed from reality.'"[^24] This paints a profoundly inaccurate summary of *both* religiosity and play, and thus are not helpful in understanding what goes on in 2b2t. To wit, FitMC once stated: "Games have always been an escape from reality. It allows us to enter into a world that we can control. But with 2b2t, this is not the case. Many of the events that have unfolded on the server throughout its history are eerily similar to events that have happened in real life."[^25]

Religiosity and play may both characterized in some individual cases by a transcendence of reality, but more often I think religiosity and play seek to *embrace* reality, even if through fantastical means. I say this both as a practitioner of a [[religion]] (Catholicism) and as a student of [[religion]] who desires to understand and communicate religiosity fairly. I find the sociological and psychoanalytic interpretations of [[religion]] to profoundly dismiss the incarnational nature of many religions. These things considered, the typology of order, [[purpose]], comfort, and removal from reality are not applicable to 2b2t. Meaning has import in 2b2t, but otherwise, Wagner's characterization of human [[desire]], which is endemic to the discipline of religious studies, is almost entirely irrelevant to the nihilistic environment of 2b2t.

# A Religion of Anarchic Irony

[[Religion]] is often understood as a very serious enterprise. We may be able to think of God as one who weeps (John 11:35) but it is harder to imagine God as one who laughs (at jokes, not the devil's demise). We like to think of [[religion]] as "structured" and mildly predictable. It may be surprising to some that, in the case of 2b2t, we find a [[religion]] oriented toward anarchy inundated with irony. But as mentioned earlier, there comes a point where it is unclear whether the players are being ironic anymore. This [[religion]] is maintained, in large part, through violent rebellion against those who seek to establish order in the server. In short, the believers of 2b2t worship an established state of affairs that makes their lives on the server possible. Some may interpret certain actions as hostility toward [[religion]], but a closer look reveals that those actions are better characterized as either an aversion to imposed order or an appendage of the natural law of 2b2t---creation and destruction. The true nature of Minecraft, as manifest in 2b2t, "makes you a better Minecrafter."[^26]

The [[religion]] of 2b2t manifests in three ways: unironic, ironic, and analogical. Unironic manifestations are most often seen in the construction and griefing of churches, cathedrals, temples, monuments, and sanctuaries. Doctrzombie points out, however, that these aren't "specific to 2b2t although it is interesting given the server\'s notorious history, but for some reason people like to build churches in block games."[^27] But there are structures unique to 2b2t that have acquired a religious specter. The Valley of Wheat is a fantastic monument, adorned with sandstone sphinxes, which is so revered on the server that even PopBob, the server's most notorious and ruthless griefer, went there to kill Jang (the builder of the Valley) but did not touch the Valley at all.[^28] While some have griefed it in the past (e.g. various Rushers) those griefers are widely discredited by older players on 2b2t.

There is something mystical about the Valley of Wheat, though. Jang was known as a hermit, but eventually accrued followers who would protect the Valley, replant crops, and kill players who attempted to grief it (which includes not replanting the wheat you harvest).[^29] The Valley of Wheat is one of the best examples of how building is integral to the life of 2b2t. With five spawn incursions, rampant [[racism]], [[homophobia]], and misogyny, it is easy to think 2b2t is driven towards antagonisms by virtue of being antagonistic. However, as Sato86 points out, "The difference between us and \[the Rushers\] is we manage to build beautiful things even in the middle of the [[war]]."[^30]

The hermetic lifestyle is, in fact, not uncommon on 2b2t. While there are plenty of examples of cities and monuments occupied by numerous players at one time (e.g. Shenandoah, Wrath Outpost, Old Town), many other players will venture out on their own and some have single-handedly built bases that have achieved considerable notoriety on the server (e.g. Space Valkyria, Fitlantis). Early on in his time on 2b2t, Doctrzombie found that "step one in any to-do list on 2b2t is to isolate yourself. Get as far away from spawn as possible so that people don't know where you are."[^31] After one establishes a base or acquires sufficient gear to survive near spawn, Doctrzombie says rather humorously, one cane "come back here to spawn and try to make it a better place. Or cover it in lava. Whatever, whatever works."[^32]

Ironic religious manifestations occur where the language *sounds* religious but is intended to be taken sarcastically. This is seen in the caveat that 2b2t players "pray to Harambe every night" or they "pray to Kappa every night because he keeps us safe." The Kappa meme is a grayscale photo of a developer with a slight smirk that is inserted at the end of a comment on a forum, typically to indicate sarcasm. Another example is the joking worship of HauseMaster, the Swedish Minecraft player who owns 2b2t.

There comes a point, however, where one is unsure whether something is intended to be ironic or unironic, either from an observer's perspective or the player's perspective. This is seen in josh's snarky condemnation of "infidels" in a Christmas post on JamesRustles' 2b2t blog.[^33] While it is standard to read josh's remarks as ironic, there is also a very real sense in which he means what he says---that those doing whatever he doesn't like are infidels. In this way, the relationship between irony and unirony is like the relationship between apophaticism and cataphaticism in [[Christianity|Christian]] [[theology]]---they mutually inform each other.

The analogical manifestations of [[religion]] in 2b2t can be extrapolated from either the nature of 2b2t itself (its social and technological functions) or through comparisons of vanilla Minecraft to the state of the real world. Analogies are not unironic or explicit and thus require a bit of exegesis (given an understanding of the vernacular of 2b2t). For instance, the Rusher Invasion may be seen as something similar to the Protestant Reformation where some accept Rusher as a new iteration of 2b2t (cf. Lutherans and Calvinists) or condemn them as the quintessential heretics (cf. anti-Reformation in the Catholic Church).

Despite the sense that everything is a joke on 2b2t, the sanctity of 2b2t's anarchic nature is nonetheless taken very seriously. Viewed broadly and in the specificity of 2b2t, [[religion]] is not an arbitrary creation of order and otherwise "untrue" mythologies. This framework, in fact, reflects a normative atheistic framework of religious studies that I am unwilling to embrace. On the contrary, [[religion]] is a lived reality wherein one sees the truth and speaks thusly. This is less a definition of [[religion]], and more a description of its manifestation in real life. For instance, in 2b2t, one does not merely "play Minecraft," rather she lives Minecraft. Take, for instance, Sato86's reflections on 2b2t:

> When you join 2b2t, you don't play it. You live it. That's the difference between 2b2t and other servers. The server has its own [[self]]. It has something that catches you and never let\[s\] you go. You slowly get used to the edgy chat and insults. You get use of the long walks on the nether highway. You start to learn how to walk on spawn core without falling to your death. You start to read more about past bases and groups. You eventually make friends. You build cities and landmarks with them. You watch as \[those\] things you built get eventually destroyed. You build more things and explore ruins of other places. You kill people and get killed too. Everything here feels more meaningful. Building has more meaning here... because it can all be gone the next week. Or never. The world is so vast, making combat hard to happen... but when it finally happens it makes your heart race. It takes time to absorb the essence of this server. Playing for 2 months won't make you one of us. 2b2t is the way Minecraft online was supposed to be played. No rules. No special plugins. Just Minecraft... And its infinite possibilities for creation and destruction. All mixed together with raw human nature. That's 2b2t. And you need to live all that. There's a reason why veterans feels \[sic\] superior to newcomers. Its because we endured. We resisted all the tests this server had for us.[^34]

Sato86 communicates a poignant aspect of the religious life of 2b2t. It is a [[religion]] of anarchy, creation and destruction, which has community, tradition, history, liturgy, and even a canon ("this is the way Minecraft was supposed to be played). A Reddit user, named RedGoner, echoes the principles we find in Sato86's video:

> Here\'s to hoping that this can serve as a device that wroughts epiphanies for any new player. If you don\'t have the determination that 2b2t demands of you, you will soon disappear\-- and even if you do, you might still disappear, so come and stay not if your will is not strong enough to survive what is in store for you, but if you do\-- whatever side you\'ve come here on\-- know that you will come to make your name history in this world. This is something that almost all old players know and hold true already if they\'ve been here long enough, so I find it unlikely that this post will prove a source of inspiration for them.[^35]

RedGoner, using an inclusio, entices the reader with language of "epiphanies" and "inspiration." In fact, TheRektaFire commented on RedGoner's post, agreeing: "Everything disappears someday, whether it be IRL or 2b2t or whatever. People are both/log in, people die/log off, shit gets built, shit gets destroyed, it\'s all just a big natural cycle of arbitrary meaningless creation and destruction and we\'re part of it :)".[^36]

Theological language is, in fact, integrated into the fabric of their vernacular as well. The strongest, most elite (aka 'OP') items are prefixed with "God." For instance, a diamond chestplate enchanted with Protection IV, Unbreaking III, and Fire Protection IV would be called a "God plate." Full diamond armor set with equivalent enchantments is called a "God set" or "God armor." Similarly, there are God apples (aka Gapples)[^37] and God swords (diamond sword enchanted with sharpness V, Unbreaking III). These items empower players destroy or kill more devastatingly. In addition, FitMC has established a museum of art and natural history which contains the rarest and most historically notable items on the server. In the museum is an End Crystal[^38] with a sign in front of it that says "'A Gift From God' Created by Taylo."[^39] [[Theology]], whether ironic or not, is a recognized aspect of 2b2t's history.

# Hacks and Exploits

Hacks and exploits are perhaps the peak of 2b2t's religious nature. Hack clients, like Impact or Wurst, are third party clients that enable players to defy standard Minecraft physics. One hack which allows players to walk on water (and lava) is aptly named the "Jesus hack." Another hack, Antihunger, enables players to survive longer without food. Fasting on 2b2t, simply put, is a prerequisite for establishing oneself as an elite or respectable player. In fact, begging for food (or other handouts) is severely chastised on the server, and sometimes elite players will seek out beggars under the guise of giving them food, only to kill them in the end. The miraculous and ascetic fervor of hack clients, thus, affords one a religious type of legitimacy.

Exploits typically utilize glitches in the source code of Minecraft (e.g. most duplication glitches) to defy game physics or accelerate normal game processes. Some exploits may be aided using hack clients. One exploit called "force OPing" occurs when a player hacks the server in such a way that they can give their account administrative privileges (e.g. creative mode, teleportation, banning capabilities, infinite items, and health).[^40] Force OPing may be comparable to nirvana in Buddhism, or to theosis in Eastern Orthodoxy. Per Doctrzombie, the worship of Hausemaster is ironic,[^41] but one is left wondering why people still cry out to him, lamenting the lag, or seek to become more like him by force OPing or use quasi-force OPing hacks.

Hacks and exploits constitute an esoteric element of 2b2t's [[religion]] such that their use---uncommon or condemned elsewhere---puts one on the path of truth. Miracles, however, do not need to be thought of as contrary to nature, only physics. Nature, following the tradition of Catholic natural law, transcends physicality. It is the true state of things as they are and are meant to be.

# Religious Violence in The Rusher Invasion

2b2t has developed a rich history since its beginnings in late 2010. Many rare artifacts have been enshrined in an art and history museum on the server, curated by FitMC. At multiple points in 2b2t's history, people or groups have attempted to establish order. The earliest on record was the Facepunchers (circa 2011-early 2013) and the most recent was TheCampingRusher and his followers, 'Rushers' (June 2016-November 2016). These have, at every point, been met with violence. What is known as the "Rusher Invasion" (which caused the Fourth Incursion) is the most recent era on 2b2t to have concluded.

TheCampingRusher is a professional or near-professional *YouTuber* in the sense that he makes *YouTube* videos partly because of the ad revenue and considers it his job in addition to enjoying the games he plays.[^42] On June 1, 2016, TheCampingRusher began a *YouTube* series on 2b2t called "The Oldest Server in Minecraft." Without hesitation, his subscribers on *YouTube* (Rushers) flooded the server which, before averaged about 20 players at its most populous. With one video, TheCampingRusher enacted a movement of thousands of Minecraft players to join 2b2t. This worsened lag and immediately filled up the server to capacity. Immediately, FitMC mobilized a movement against TheCampingRusher called the veterans. Interestingly enough, a prominent Rusher, TheJadhya, argues that "the [[war]] actually never started" but he "wanted there to be a [[war]]" thereby corroborating the impressions many veterans, like Sato86, have of the Rushers.[^43]

One Reddit user, IamTUNA, compares TheCampingRusher to Muslims, saying: "The sole [[purpose]] of the existence of the rusher (muslims) bring [[suffering]] on the good people (whites)."[^44] Rushers are known as beggars, pure griefers, and noobs. Those who came to the server post-Rusher but didn't fit that description have been somewhat accepted in the community (or parts thereof) because they can hold their own (e.g. NedaT). In an attempt to streamline the production of his videos on *YouTube*, he created the queue plugin for 2b2t to avoid waiting for hours. Hausemaster insisted that those who joined the server on June 1, 2016 and earlier would have priority in the queue (veteran queue). Players, however, could also donate to TheCampingRusher in order to get priority in the queue as well (premium queue).[^45]

Torogadude and other members of the Fourth Reich[^46] hacked the Minecraft and Skype accounts of another *YouTuber*, LandonMC, who was friends with TheCampingRusher. One of the hackers, probably Torogadude, allegedly said to LandonMC, "I just hacked you for fun."[^47] Previously unknown, Torogadude revealed through the hack that TheCampingRusher had powers over the priority queue such that he could add or delete names for the list at will.[^48] Though LandonMC was not mad about the hack and took the situation rather lightheartedly,[^49] TheCampingRusher was angry about the violation of his friend's privacy so he deleted Torogadude's name from the priority list, effectively banning him from the server which he otherwise would have had access to had TheCampingRusher not come along.[^50]

In short, TheCampingRusher gave Torogadude a meta-game punishment for something he did outside of the server. This was the first time in the server's history anyone had ever been given a meta-game punishment. While Torogadude's name was promptly re-added to the [[veteran]] queue,[^51] these events represent a sort of order-mongering that players on 2b2t players hate about career *YouTubers*, and may be considered to be the climax of the Fourth Incursion/Rusher Invasion, as it sparked on the last major burst of violence before TheCampingRusher began diminishing his presence on the server. While there is much to analyze about this conflict---especially between career *YouTubers* and hackers---it stands that the violence of the Fourth Incursion was not *merely* for violence's sake. It was to weed out those who were only there, in the words of Sato86, to "not to be accepted into the community, but to destroy it."[^52]

# Final Thoughts

The history of 2b2t is vast and direct sources are widely available on multiple platforms. For this reason, I had to leave out many details in attempt to paint an accurate and compelling picture of [[religion]] and its violent manifestations on 2b2t. Because of the terse nature of this paper, the religious spirit of 2b2t deserves far more attention than given here.

While there are conceptual tensions and a great degree of chaos in these cosmos, 2b2t's [[religion]] is both evident and subtle throughout the server's existence. Its central canon can be understood as the preservation of Minecraft as it was created to be played---without rules. The tautological nature of this axiom may be ironic or unconvincing on one hand, but on the other it proves it to be all the truer. The rules of logic, of [[fairness]], are only conveniences in the server's [[religion]]; they are always at the mercy of a greater cause: creation, destruction, and the natural state of affairs that make them possible. Violence manifests out of this religious pulse, partly for the joy of griefing, but also for the protection of a sacred way of life, of a history. It remains to be seen, however, what role peacemakers have in a [[religion]] such as the one found in 2b2t.

[^1]: 2b2t is an acronym for "2 Builders, 2 Tools." However, the etymology is not important for the purposes of this paper, so I will not explore it in this paper. Colloquially, 2b2t is known as "The World's Worst Server" (seen in the earliest of DoctrZombie's videos), "The World's Oldest Server" (seen in TheCampingRusher's videos) and "The World's Second Oldest Server" (seen in various contexts correcting or mocking TheCampingRusher). 2b2t was started in December 2010, ten months before the game's official release date (October 2011). It is located at the IP: 2b2t.org.

[^2]: Refers to Minecraft construed without special plugins or mods; "pure" Minecraft, if you will.

[^3]: The creation of in-game systems that require so many constant updates that it reduces the speed at which the server responds worldwide. Many lag machines have existed in 2b2t, but not many have been effective enough to crash the server singlehandedly (e.g. timing out, Ddosing \[distributed denial of service\]).

[^4]: All players in 2b2t are set to survival mode and cannot change their mode (to creative or spectator) as their lack of administrative privileges prevents them from doing so normally.

[^6]: Hereafter, coordinates will simply be reported with numbers in this order: (x),(y),(z). Wherever coordinates are reported, but only two numbers are given, it is (x),(z) where (y) is irrelevant or unknown. "Coordinates" may also be abbreviated to "coords."

[^7]: Giant curtains of flowing lava have occasionally surrounded spawn. See Figure I.

[^8]: Pouring water over a lava wall will create a giant mass of cobblestone known as a cobble monster or a lava cast. See Figure II.

[^9]: Created by people attempting to mine their way out of the cobble monsters.

[^10]: Similar to cobble monsters and lava casts, but made out of obsidian which is hand-placed, rather than massively generated by combining water with flowing lava. See Figure III.

[^11]: One of the deadliest mobs in vanilla Minecraft. They can be created in any realm with [[soul]] sand and Wither skeleton heads. They fire wither heads at players and animals which explode on impact and give a status effect called "wither." See Figure IV.
