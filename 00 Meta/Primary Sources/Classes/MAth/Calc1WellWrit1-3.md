This problem has 2 parts which may feel like very different problems, but are not.

1.  A stone is dropped into a lake, creating a circular ripple that travels outward at a speed of 60 cm/s.

    a.  Sketch a picture of what is happening (not a graph, just a picture).

    b.  What quantities are changing, which are fixed? Assign (and properly define) variables to the changing quantities.

> The circumference and areas of each of the circles created by the ripple are both increasing. The speed of the ripple is staying the same. As the circle increases the energy from the stone is being dispersed and thus the ripple slowly fade.

c.  Express the radius *r* of the circle as a function of the time *t* in seconds.

> r(t) = 60t

d.  Express the area *A* of the circle as a function of *r*.

> A(r) = πr^2^

e.  Find *A*◦*r* and interpret it.

> A(r(t)) = π(60t)^2^

2.  A spherical balloon is being inflated and the volume of the balloon is increasing at a rate of 30 cm^3^ per second.

    a.  Sketch a picture of what is happening (not a graph, just a picture).

    b.  What quantities are changing, which are fixed? Assign (and properly define) variables to

the changing quantities.

The volume of the balloon is changing, but the rate at which it is moving is fixed.

t = time since the volume of the balloon started expanding

V(t) = the volume of the balloon. V(t) is measured in centimeters cubed.

c.  Express the volume *V* of the balloon as a function of the time *t* in seconds

> V(t) = 30t

d.  Express the radius *r* of the balloon as a function of *V* .

e.  Find *r*◦*V* and interpret it.

3.  Which scenario is more probable in real life, and why?

    a.  The rippling water as most balloons are not perfect spheres, but ripples are near perfect circles.
