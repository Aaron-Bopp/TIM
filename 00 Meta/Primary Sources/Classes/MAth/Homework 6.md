Homework 6.

I.  A reader wrote in to the "Ask Marilyn " column in *Parade* magazine to say that his grandfather told him that in 2/3 (66.67%) of all baseball games, the winning team scores more runs in one inning than the losing team scores in the entire game. To investigate this claim, you randomly selected one week of the 2006 major-league baseball season, then you examined the 95 games played that week to determine which had a big bang and which did not. You found that of the 95 games in your sample, 47 contained a big bang.

a.  What is the parameter of interest in your investigation?

> Whether or not the game included a big bang (the winning team scoring as much as the other team in one inning)

b.  Is 66.67% a parameter or a statistic?

It is a parameter because it is about all baseball games not the sample baseball games

c.  Calculate pˆ?

47/95 = .494

d.  What is the standard error for the sampling distribution?

sqrt((.6667(1-.6667))/95) = .0484

e.  Do you think the proportion you got from your sample is plausible, if the center for the population is 66.67%? Justify.

> We see how many SD's away from the 66.67 49.4 is.
>
> (.494-.6667) / .0484 = -3.5
>
> It is more than 3SD's away so there is only .15% chance it will happen. Very unlikely

f.  Based on your sample statistic, give a plausible range where do you think the TRUE proportion of "big bang" games is? (Hint: use 95% [[confidence]] interval)

> 39.72% to 59.08%

g.  Does f) mean that the TRUE proportion MUST be in that range? Explain.

It means that there is a 95% chance that it will land in that range

II. In 1960, census results indicated that the age at which American men first married had a mean of 23.3 years and standard deviation 5.3 years. You have noticed the age is getting older. You selected a random sample of 40 men and found the average of first marriage is 24.2 years.

a.  What is the parameter of interest? What symbol do we use for it?

> The age at which American men are first getting married. M because it is an average

b.  What is the statistic? What symbol do we use for it?

> Average age at first marriage of the 40 men in your sample. x̅

c.  What is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution?

5.3/sqrt(40) = 0.83

d.  Is it plausible to get a sample average of 24.2 years, when the population average is 23.2 years? Justify

> 23.2 is 1.2 SD's away from 24.2 so it is plausible that it would be in that range

e.  Based on your sample, where do you think the TRUE average of first marriage is? (Give a 95% [[confidence]] interval)

> 22.54 to 25.86
