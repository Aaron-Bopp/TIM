Homework 8

**Maze**. A professor in the psychology department needs a maze that will take rats an average of about one minute to solve. He tests one maze on several rats, collecting the data. (Time in seconds)

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  38.4    46.2    62.5    38.0    62.8    33.9    50.4    35.0    52.8    60.1
  ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- ------- -------
  55.1    57.6    55.5    49.5    40.9    44.3    56.3    47.9    69.2    46.2

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a.  Plot the data. Is the N.N.C. satisfied? (show your histogram)

b.  The researcher wants to test that the mean completion time for this maze is 60 seconds. IS this a proportion problem or a mean problem?

> mean problem

c.  What is the parameter of interest? What symbol should you use for this parameter?

> the mean time to complete the maze for the rats. M

d.  Write the null and alternative hypothesis.

Ho = The mean time to complete is 60 seconds

Ha = the mean time to complete is not equal to 60

e.  What is the average of the sample? What symbol do you use to represent it?

x̄ = 50.13 Standard error = 2.2137

f.  How many standard errors is the sample average away from the parameter of interest?

50 is 4.5 standard errors away from 60

g.  What is the p-value of your test?

0.00027

h.  What is your conclusion?

Ho is incorrect and we accept Ha

i.  Estimate where the true mean of this maze is. (Use 95% [[confidence]] interval)

44.5 to 54.78

> **Alpha.** a) A hypothesis test rejects the null hypothesis at the level α = 0.05. Would this test have rejected the null at α = 0.1? How about α = 0.01?
>
> It would have rejected at 0.1 because we are confident it is less than that but it may not have at 0.01 because we do not know if it was less or greater than that
>
> b\) A hypothesis test rejected the null with p-value = 0.01. Another test rejected the same null with p-value = 0.001. Which of the tow tests had the stronger evidence against the null?
>
> The second test a smaller p-value means stronger evidence.
