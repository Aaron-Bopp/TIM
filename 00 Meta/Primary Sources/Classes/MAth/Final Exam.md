Exam 2

1.  It is believed that in 2/3 (66.67%) of all baseball games, the winning team scores more runs in one inning than the losing team scores in the entire game. To investigate this claim, you randomly selected one week of the 2006 major-league baseball season, then you examined the 95 games played that week to determine which had a big bang and which did not. You found that of the 95 games in your sample, 47 contained a big bang.

4.  How many standard errors is the p\^ away from the center?

```
A)  1.5 B) 2.5 C) 2 D) 1.2 E) None

5.  The P-value of the investigation is

> Very low because p\^ is 3.5 SD away from p

6.  Your conclusion is

7.  A statistics professor at a large university wants to know if more than 80% of her students enjoyed taking her classes. At the end of the term, she takes a random sample of students from her large classes and asks, in an anonymous survey, if the students enjoyed taking her class. Out of the 53 who were sampled, 44 enjoyed her class. Which set of hypotheses should she test?

> A\) *H~0~*: *p* = 0.83 *H~A~*: *p* \> 0.83 C) *H~0~*: *p* \> 0.83 *H~A~*: *p* = 0.83
>
> B\) *H~0~*: *p* = 0.80 *H~A~*: *p* \> 0.80 D) *H~0~*: *p* \> 0.80 *H~A~*: *p* = 0.80

8.  An online catalog company wants on-time delivery for 90% of the orders they ship. They have been shipping orders via UPS and FedEx but will switch to a new, cheaper delivery service (ShipFast) unless there is evidence that this service cannot meet the 90% on-time goal. As a test the company sends a random sample orders via ShipFast, and then makes follow-up phone calls to see if these orders arrived on time. Which hypotheses should they test?

> A\) *H~0~*: *p* \< 0.90 *H~A~*: *p* \> 0.90 C) *H~0~*: *p* \> 0.90 *H~A~*: *p* = 0.90
>
> B\) *H~0~*: *p* = 0.90 *H~A~*: *p* \> 0.90 D) *H~0~*: *p* = 0.90 *H~A~*: *p* \< 0.90

9.  In their advertisements, the manufacturers of a diet pill would like to claim that taken daily, their pill will produce a mean weight loss of more than 10 pounds in one month. In order to determine if this is a valid claim, they hire an independent testing agency, which then selects 25 people to take the pill daily for a month. The agency should be testing the null hypothesis H0 : µ = 10 and the alternative hypothesis

> A\) Ha: µ \< 10 B) Ha: µ \> 10 C) Ha: µ = 10 D) Ha: µ = 10

10. A city ballot includes a local initiative that would legalize gambling. The issue is hotly contested, and two groups decide to conduct polls to predict the outcome. The local newspaper finds 53% of 1200 randomly selected voters plan to vote "yes", while a college Statistics class finds 54% of 450 randomly selected voters in support. Both groups will create 95% [[confidence]] intervals. Which of the two [[confidence]] intervals will have a larger margin of error?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
A.  The local newspaper

B.  The Statistics class.

C.  Since the [[confidence]] level is the same, the margin of error has to be the same

```
11. We have calculated a 95% [[confidence]] interval and would prefer for our next [[confidence]] interval to have a smaller margin of error. In order to do this, we should

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
A)  take a larger sample B) take a smaller sample

```
12. Which of the following is **[not]{.ul}** an option for an alternative (research) hypothesis?

> A\) $H_{a}:P > 40\%$. C) $H_{a}:P < 40\%$.
>
> B\) $H_{a}:P \neq 40\%$. D) $H_{a}:P = 40\%$.

13. Ten men volunteered to test an exercise machine by using it three times a week for 20 minutes. Their resting pulse rates were measured before the test began, and then again after 6 weeks. Results are shown in the table. Is there an evidence that this kind of exercise can reduce resting pulse rate? By how much, on avergae?

a.  What is the response variable?

Their resting heart rate

b.  Is this an experiment or an observational study?

Observational study

c.  What kind of design is this?

Observational study where you take the mean of your volunteers and do the same thing to all of them and then see if your mean has changed.

d.  What type of test should you run (two independent samples t test, matching pairs, etc...)

t-test for matching pairs

e.  What are the null and alternative hypotheses? Check the conditions.

*H~0~*: machine does not reduce heartrate *H~A~*: machine does reduce heartrate

f.  What is the p-value? What is the t statistic?

P-value = 0.003361758

t-stat = 3.5

g.  State your conclusion in context.

Regular exercise on the machine will on average meaningfully reduce the exercisers resting heart rate

h.  What is the 95% [[confidence]] interval (estimate the mean change)?

> (80.269, 90.131)

14. What does a 95% [[confidence]] interval mean?

15. Download the "Body Fat" dataset from course site. You would like to know which variable is a better predictor of body fat, weight or waist?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
a.  What is the response variable?

Body fat

b.  Draw a scatter plot for waist vs. body fat AND weight vs. body fat.

[\[CHART\]]{.chart} [\[CHART\]]{.chart}

c.  Visually, describe the relationship between the waist and body fat.

As the waist size goes up the body fat percentage goes up

Pattern: linear

Strength: 78%

Direction: Direct relationship (as one goes up the other goes up)

Outliers: The body fat percentage of 38 is much higher than the others but removing it does not meaningfully change the outcome of the study

d.  What is the equation of the models you choose to represent the relationship in each case?

linear

e.  Interpret the slope of the line representing the relationship between weight and body fat.

As your weight goes up by 1 your body fat goes up by 0.2499

f.  Which of the two variables do you think is a better predictor of body fat? Why?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
A)  Weight B) Waist

> Why: R\^2 is much higher for waist which means that the line is a better fit.
