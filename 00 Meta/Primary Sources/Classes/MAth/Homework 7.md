Homework 7

I.  Monkeying Around

> Can rhesus monkeys understand the gestures of humans? Researchers investigated this question with a sample of 40 monkeys (Hauser, Glynn, and Wood, 2007). In front of each monkey, a human separated two boxes and then jutted his head three times in the direction of one particular box. Researchers then waited and saw which box the monkey app-roached. They found that 30 of 40 monkeys approached the box that the human had jutted his head toward. You would like to test whether this provides an evidence that more than 50% of all rhesus monkeys would approach the targeted box.

a.  What is the parameter (what is p)?

> P = .5 50% of all monkeys approach the targeted box

b.  What is pˆ?

P\^ = .75 30/40 of the sample monkeys approached the targeted box

c.  Set up the null and alternative hypothesis.

> H0: P = .5
>
> Ha: P \> .5

d.  Check the conditions for "hypothesis test for proportion"

The sample is appropriately sized for the population of monkeys

e.  What is the standard error for the sample?

> SD: .0791

f.  How far is pˆ from the center?

> It is 3.16 SD's from the center

g.  Do you think the p-value is small or not?

> It is small. The chance of getting that number is very, very small.

h.  What is your conclusion? DO you agree with H or not? Justify.

H­(a) is most likely correct because it is very unlikely to get .75 if .5 is the normal proportion. The gesturing did have an effect

II. Researchers found that in a sample of 2101 [[Vietnam]] veterans, 777 had been divorced at least once (Gimbel and Booth, 1994). U. S. Census figures indicate that among all American men aged 30-44 when the study was conducted in 1985, 27% had been divorced at least once. You would like to conduct a hypothesis test to assess whether or not the sample data from the study provide strong evidence that the divorce rate among all [[Vietnam]] veterans is greater than 27%.

a.  What is the parameter of interest? What symbol do we use for it?

> P=.27

b.  What is the statistic pˆ?

> 777/2101= 0.3698 = P\^

c.  What is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution?

.009685

d.  Set up the null and alternative hypothesis.

> H0: P = .27 The divorce rate of [[Vietnam]] veterans matches the one of all [[America|Americans]] and is 27%

Ha: P \> .27 The divorce rate of [[Vietnam]] veterans is higher than 27%

e.  Conclusion: Based on your sample, do you agree with null hypothesis or with the alternative hypothesis? Justify.

> The sample P\^ is 10 SD's higher from the P. This proves the Ha must be correct. The [[Vietnam]] veterans divorce rate is much higher than divorce rate of all [[America|Americans]]

f.  Based on your sample, where do you think the TRUE divorce rate among [[Vietnam]] veterans is? (Give a 95% [[confidence]] interval)

.35043 to .38917 or 35% to 38%
