An airplane takes off from an airport and lands an hour later at another airport 400 miles away. If t represents the time in minutes since the plane has left the terminal building, let x(t) be the horizontal distance traveled (in miles) and y(t) be the altitude of the plane (in feet). You are to make four graph sketches as described below. In addition to the graphs, explain, for each graph, the story (meaning) behind the points (as curves) sketched. Also, two pairs of graphs are related meaning if you know one, you can figure out the other. Which graphs are related, and how are they related?

1\. A possible graph of x(t).

As the plane first takes off it is slowly increasing its speed until it reaches its max speed at about five minutes in. Once the plane reaches max speed the horizontal distance will increase at a constant rate (this is not taking into account the slight changes due to turbulence or other variables) until it starts its descent at about 40 minutes. The plane lands after travelling 400 miles horizontally in one hour. The slope of this graph can be converted into the speed of the plane.

2\. A possible graph of y(t).

After the plane takes off the altitude will increase at a fairly constant rate until it reaches cruising altitude. The cruising altitude for a modern jet airliner is about 35,000 feet. It takes about 20 minutes for an airliner to reach this altitude and about 20 for it to descend.

3\. A possible graph for the ground speed.

The speed of the plane will increase until they reach their max speed at five minutes in. There may be slight fluctuations for the max speed at different points in the flight (due to turbulence, other airplanes, etc.) but this graph will not take those into account. The speed of a commercial jet airliner is about 400-500 knots. Once the plane begins its descent its speed will decrease until it lands.

4\. A possible graph for the vertical velocity.

The vertical velocity of the plane will increase and then decrease as it reaches cruising altitude at 20 minutes in. Because the plane is not moving up or down when it is at cruising altitude the vertical velocity will not change for most the flight. At about 40 minutes, when the plane starts to descend, its velocity will increase and decrease in a very similar way except that it will abruptly stop when it reaches the ground.

While the graphs are all related in various ways, I think the ground speed graph and the x(t) graph are the most related. The slope the graph of x(t) is the speed of the plane. Thus the graph of the ground speed is a graph of the slope of x(t). If you were to continue this pattern the graph of the slope of ground speed graph would be the acceleration of the plane.
