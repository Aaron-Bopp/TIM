2\. Suppose a small [[economy]] has a civilian noninstitutional population (CNP) of 30 million people. Of the CNP, 20 million are in the labor force. Of the labor force, 1.5 million are unemployed. Use this information to calculate the following (**show your work and round to the nearest hundredth**):

> a\) How many people are employed in the [[economy]]?
>
> 18.5 million
>
> b\) Calculate the [[economy]]'s [[unemployment]] rate.
>
> 1.5/20=7.5% [[unemployment]]
>
> c\) Calculate the [[economy]]'s labor force participation rate.

20/30= 66.6%

3\. Use the BLS website's National [[Unemployment]] Rate page (<http://www.bls.gov/cps/>) to find the following:

> a\) What is the current national (U.S.) [[unemployment]] rate?
>
> 3.6%
>
> b\) What is the current (civilian) labor force participation rate?
>
> 63.4% (season adjusted)

4\. Use the following link to the BLS State and Local [[Unemployment]] Rates information (<https://www.bls.gov/lau/>)

to find the following:

> b\) What is the current [[unemployment]] rate in Missouri?
>
> 3.3%
>
> c\) Which state currently has the highest [[unemployment]] rate (exclude Puerto Rico)? What is this state's [[unemployment]] rate?
>
> 6.1% Alaska
>
> d\) Which state currently has the lowest [[unemployment]] rate? What is this state's [[unemployment]] rate?
>
> 2.3% Utah Vermont and south Carolina tie

5\. Use the following link (<https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat01.pdf>) to open "Employment status of the CNP, 1949 to date". Find the [[unemployment]] rates in the following years. (Hint: think about the formula for [[unemployment]] rate to help you figure out which column to use---you do **[not]{.ul}** have to do any calculations.)

> a\) 1950: 5.3%
>
> b\) 1982: 9.7%
>
> c\) 2000: 4.0%
>
> d\) 2010: 9.6%

6\. Use the following link (<https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat11.pdf>) to open "Employed persons by detailed occupation, sex, race, and Hispanic or [[Latine|Latino]] ethnicity". Choose an occupation that interests you. Fill in the table below for your chosen occupation.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7\. Use the following link (<https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat07.pdf>) to find "Employment status of the CNP 25 years and over by educational attainment". Find the [[unemployment]] rates in 2019 for each of the following (Total):

> a\) Those with less than a high school diploma: 5.4%
