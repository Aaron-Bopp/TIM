1\. A small [[economy]] produces the goods shown in the table above. Use the information shown in the table to calculate the following. **2017 is the base year. *Show all work and round answers to the nearest hundredth.***

> a\) Nominal GDP for each year
>
> 2016: (\$5\*500) + (\$1\*350) + (\$20\*100) = \$4850
>
> 2017: (\$5.25\*500) + (\$1.5\*350) + (\$20\*100) = \$5150
>
> 2018: (\$5.50\*500) + (\$1.5\*350) + (\$21\*100) = \$5375
>
> b\) Real GDP for each year

2016: (\$5\*500) + (\$1\*350) + (\$20\*100) = \$4850

2017: (\$5\*525) + (\$1\*375) + (\$20\*100) = \$5000

2018: (\$5\*550) + (\$1\*375) + (\$20\*125) = \$5625

> c\) Economic growth rate from 2016 to 2017
>
> \[(\$5000 - \$4850)/\$4850\] x 100 = 3.1%
>
> d\) Economic growth rate from 2017 to 2018

\[(\$5625 - \$5000)/\$5000\] x 100 = 12.5%

2\. Do some research and then describe how the coronavirus (COVID-19) is affecting our [[economy]]. Be sure to include the effects on GDP. Your discussion needs to be a minimum of one page, double spaced. Be sure to properly cite your sources.

COVID-19 is impacting our [[economy]] in a variety of interesting and devastating ways. For the past two weeks we have seen more people file for [[unemployment]] than ever before. 3.3 million in one week which is more than fourfold the previous highest single week ever. In addition, stay-at-home orders have been issued in all but nine states. These orders close all non-essential [[business]], and place restrictions on how essentials businesses can be run. These restrictions almost always impact a company's bottom line, and many businesses are being forced to lay off employees or shut down because of it.

The [[government]] has passed one of the most aggressive stimulus and relief packages in history, the CARES act, but many critics say that this will not be enough or is less than other nations. (Edwards, "Is There Enough Time") This act provides direct cash to citizens who make less than \$100k a year in the form of \$1200 checks. It also provides many expansions to [[unemployment]] benefits including making it easier to get [[unemployment]], removing the requirement of looking for work, and adding up to \$600 per week. Gig-workers, freelancers, and independent contractors are now eligible, as well as part time workers. These [[unemployment]] benefits will not apply to people who are able to work from home or are getting paid leave. (Bernard, "F.A.Q. on Stimulus Checks")

Whether or not this act will keep the [[stock market]] afloat or allow people to pay their bills on time, COVID-19 will undoubtedly have an impact on GDP. People are spending less money. Even if they can still pay their rent and bills and buy groceries, they're not going to the movies, or out to eat. People are also not buying as many electronics or luxury goods and are instead saving. These will all directly impact GDP.

As we are still in the middle of this crisis, its hard to tell what the outcomes will be. The most pessimistic of economists are predicting [[unemployment]] rates in the double digits. They're predicting massive collapses in GDP and everything that comes as a result of that. They a predicting a recession greater than 2008, and possibly more than a recession, a [[depression]]. (Cohan, "COVID-19\'s Worst Case?") These are all just predictions, but we will see what happens. We are truly living in extraordinary times
