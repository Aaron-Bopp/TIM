# Political Ideologies of Politicians and Parties

-   Liberal -- Equality of outcome

-   Conservative -- Equality of opportunity

-   Party does not always follow complete political ideology

-   Madisonian model -- Don't trust the masse, separation of powers, checks and balances

-   Classical liberalism -- hates/reforms from monarchy, wants republics not direct democracy, legislature makes the law executive enacts the law,

-   Confederate system -- gives more power to states

-   Federal -- gives more power to national [[government]]

-   Negative right -- something that you don't have a right to do, (how to do we allow liberty, don't allow the [[government|govt]] to infringe upon it) [[government|govt]] cannot do things(constitution is full of these),

-   The right to bear arms is an individual right

-   Inherent power theory
