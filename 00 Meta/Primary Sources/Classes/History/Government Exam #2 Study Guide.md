**GOVERNMENT EXAM #2 OUTLINE**

1.  Civil Liberties. [[Civil Rights]]. What's the difference?

    a.  The Incorporation Doctrine: using the 14^th^ amendment to "incorporate" civil liberties from the Bill of Rights into all levels of [[government]], from the local up to the federal.

        i.  States like alabama were claiming that the constitution only applied in federal areas (after the [[civil war]])

    b.  Civil liberties are the end, [[civil rights]] are the means to the end. We should have certain civil liberties, [[civil rights]] protects them

2.  What is "the press"?

    a.  Reporters vs. pundits \-- what's the difference?

        i.  Reporters report the news, pundits discuss the news, both are biased but pundits are meant to give a biased opinion on unbiased facts

    b.  The Daily Stormer, MSNBC, FoxNews, etc.... "Enemy of the people," and therefore deserving of being shut down by the [[government]]?

        i.  Violates free speech and freedom of the press

3.  Active speech versus Symbolic Speech

    a.  Why can a person be punished for yelling "FIRE!" in a crowded theater?

        i.  It could cause pandemonium and hurt other people

    b.  Why can a person generally NOT be punished for having a swastika tattoo? (Albeit Hesse could be fired from his job for having one on his forehead \-- but maybe not if it is under his shirt)

        i.  Could be covered under freedom of [[religion]] (hindu), individual institutions would have to have specific statutes to allow them to fire you over it. Intent matters and can make things messy

    c.  Why can a person actively burn a U.S. flag? The POLITICAL reasons for the first amendment; see *Texas v. Johnson \-- see [[https://www.oyez.org/cases/1988/88-155]{.ul}](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1988/88-155)*

        i.  It's non-violent, even if the majority doesn't like it they should have their individual liberties and shouldn't be singled out

    d.  Taking a knee during the national anthem.

        i.  Are you allowed to express political opinions on the job? Yes -- but the 1^st^ amendment doesn't protect you from consequences. In most states, employers (like NFL team owners) are allowed to fire an employee for any reason short of a "Title VII reason" and the "protected class status" therein...

            1.  Title VII of the [[Civil Rights]] Act of 1964 is a federal law that prohibits employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin, and [[religion]].

        ii. Retired Army Green Beret Nate Boyer is the man who first convinced Colin Kaepernick to kneel during the national anthem.

            1.  [[https://www.armytimes.com/opinion/2016/08/30/an-open-letter-to-colin-kaepernick-from-a-green-beret-turned-long-snapper/]{.ul}](https://www.armytimes.com/opinion/2016/08/30/an-open-letter-to-colin-kaepernick-from-a-green-beret-turned-long-snapper/)

            2.  [[http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/\_/id/21003968/nfl-2017-ex-green-beret-nate-boyer-writes-open-letter-president-donald-trump-colin-kaepernick-nfl-united-states-america]{.ul}](http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/21003968/nfl-2017-ex-green-beret-nate-boyer-writes-open-letter-president-donald-trump-colin-kaepernick-nfl-united-states-[[america]])

            3.  [[https://www.npr.org/2018/09/09/646115651/the-[[veteran]]-and-nfl-player-who-advised-kaepernick-to-take-a-knee]{.ul}](https://www.npr.org/2018/09/09/646115651/the-[[veteran]]-and-nfl-player-who-advised-kaepernick-to-take-a-knee)

        iii. Colin Kaepernick's view:

             1.  Police Stops in Missouri \-- [[https://www.ago.mo.gov/home/vehicle-stops-report]{.ul}](https://www.ago.mo.gov/home/vehicle-stops-report)

                 a.  Black drivers much more likely to get stopped and searched and arrested than white drivers

                 b.  Racist cops make it a lot harder for the rest of the cops

             2.  Disparities in Police Shootings \-- Black males are only 6% of the general population, but no less than 25% of fatal police shootings involve a black male.

                 a.  3 people get shot a day involved police encounter

                 b.  1 in 4 police shootings involve a person with a mental illness

        iv. Michigan State research

            1.  [[Black people]] murder rates are much higher than any other race

            2.  This is because of many different reasons

            3.  How to fix

                a.  Maybe implicit bias training

                b.  Best way is to reduce the violence the cops are responding too. Pockets of violence in cities draw more police activity

4.  Free Speech vs. Hate Speech

    a.  Recent events in Creston, Iowa \-- when can high school athletes be kicked off of the team?

        i.  What was the intent? Participants claim [[ignorance]]

            1.  Was an individual harrassed? Or was it just generally racist

        ii. Supreme court precedent of burning a cross not being racist unless the intention

    b.  When is cross burning protected speech? When is it criminal speech?

    c.  The "United the Right Rally" in Charlottesville, Virginia, August 2017

        i.  Inciting incident: people wanting to take down a Robert E Lee monument on a public college property

        ii. People marching for and against

        iii. Antifa was involved

5.  Do you have a right NOT to be offended in college?

    a.  Today's campus controversies reflect a battle between two distinct conceptions of the term---what the Greeks called *isegoria* and *parrhesia*. What are these terms? How are they present on college campuses today?

    b.  Free speech on university campuses... From NWMSU's SAC Lectures to Ben Shapiro...

6.  Freedom of the Press / Speech / Peaceful assembly online and beyond

    a.  Russian meddling in U.S. Elections

        i.  What did the Senate Intelligence Committee find with regard to...

            1.  the "Heart of Texas" group online?

            2.  The "Black Matters U.S." group online?

        ii. What did the Mueller Report conclude regarding...

            1.  Whether the Russian [[government]] meddled in the 2016 election

            2.  Whether the Trump campaign conspired with the [[Russia|Russians]]

            3.  Whether President Trump obstructed the Mueller investigation

                a.  Why did Robert Mueller use the phrase "If we had [[confidence]] the President did not commit a crime, we would have said so..." How does this phrase relate to Department of Justice policy about the DoJ NOT being able to accuse a sitting president of a federal crime? If a sitting president cannot be charged with a federal crime, what recourse is there under "checks and balances"?

        iii. [[Russia]]'s online realities in U.S. elections

             1.  Misinformation and Disinformation

> Dictionary.com defines **misinformation** as "false information that is spread, regardless of whether there is intent to mislead." And it describes **disinformation** as "deliberately misleading or biased information; manipulated narrative or facts; [[propaganda]]."
