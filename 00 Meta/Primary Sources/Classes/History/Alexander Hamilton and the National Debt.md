What would the founder's think of our nation now? Would they be disgusted? Perplexed? So wholly confused that they would die of brain aneurysm? Do the words of our forefathers still hold value in a world that is so different from the ones they were alive in, or does wisdom hold true despite the circumstance? Out first secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, has in recent years, come to the forefront of the modern American's mind, thanks to his titular role in a modern Broadway play, but does his understanding of [[economy]] still hold up over two-hundred years later?

As Hamilton said in his, "First Report on the Public Credit," public credit or [[debt]], "is a matter of high importance to the honor and prosperity of [[America|the United States]].\"[^1] Since [[debt]] is of such importance, not being on good terms with your lender could result in extravagant premiums. When Hamilton wrote this report, the nation was fifty million dollars in [[debt]], and only ten of that was to foreign entities, but despite that Hamilton wanted to get rid of foreign [[debt]] as quickly as possible. He believed that foreign [[debt]] weakened [[America]], and that it was wholly inferior to domestic, citizen owned [[debt]]. His reasoning was that foreign [[debt]] must be paid in a timely matter to its holders, or else the nation could face retaliation, whereas domestic [[debt]] was more forgiving, as its holders were more likely to be reasonable.[^2]

Hamilton would be disgusted to hear that the amount of [[debt]] held by foreign powers has risen to near 50% in recent years, and that the second largest foreign creditor is the People's Bank of [[China]].[^3] This would, in Hamilton's view, put [[America]] in a very dangerous position, and his view is shared by many economists today. Some would argue that because [[China]] hold's such a large share US [[debt]], it has a strangle hold on our [[government]]. By selling their securities, [[China]] could devalue [[America|the US]] dollar and, "ring an end to [[America]]'s 'exorbitant privilege' in the global financial system." [^4]

Other economists would argue to the contrary. They believe that the amount of [[debt]] the foreign nations hold is a sign of their reliance on [[America|the US]] Treasury as global haven. Indeed, if foreign powers try to sell off their US securities, they risk devaluing [[America|the US]] dollar, which would cause them to lose part of the money they credited to [[America|the US]]. This gives [[America|the US]] power over the countries that they owe money too and gives those countries a vested interest in US success.[^5]

[[America|The US]] [[economy]] of today, is much different than the one Hamilton dealt with in his time. In many ways, [[America|the US]] [[economy]] has only a small distinction from the global [[economy]]. As the world continues to globalize its [[markets]], the nature of foreign [[debt]] becomes increasingly more complicated. There are however people working this. President Trump has pulled [[America]] out of trade agreements that he says put [[America|the US]] in a weaker position. He wishes to strengthen [[America|the US]]'s position in the world [[economy]] through trade.

In general, Hamilton is not scared of national [[debt]]. He feels that if the [[debt]] is properly and confidently funded then it can act in the same way as money. There are three main benefits of this kind of [[debt]], it increases the amount of capital that exists to trade with, it promotes agriculture and manufacturing, and it lowers the interest of money. When realized, these benefits help workers of all kinds.[^6]

If we ignore the fact that our [[debt]] being from foreign powers would disqualify it from being good in Hamilton's eyes, we can try and decipher if his benefits of [[debt]] are still holding true today. There is a specific moment in recent history that increased our national [[debt]] a great deal, and exemplified the three benefits that Hamilton outlined above, and that is 2008 financial crisis. In times of recession borrowing may be required in order to boost the [[economy]]. In timems of recession the [[government]] will try to boost the [[economy]] by exemplifying the benefits Hamilton laid out.[^7] But according to the CBC the deficit for 2020 will increase to one trillion dollars, twenty years after the recession ended[^8] This is in large part due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.[^9] Which comes at a time when GDP is on the rise and the [[economy]] is doing well. [^10] While the act may bring capital back to [[America|the US]] by reducing corporate tax rate, which could increase GDP, it also encourages leaving assets offshore until needed because it imposes no repatriation tax. Overall, the act could cost \$1.456 trillion of revenue loss over the next ten years, though it is also projected to increase GDP. This raises concerns that the act will reduce budget flexibility for the next recession, and worsen the fiscal imbalance in [[America|the US]].[^11] The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act aimed encourage companies to be US corporations and to repatriate the money that earn, or at least not report it as profits from overseas. It hoped to lead to a substantial increase in wages.[^12]

In theory this is the kind of [[debt]] that Hamilton would want us to use. If the taking on of more [[debt]] will help the American people, and not hinder [[America|the US]]'s ability to take part in world [[economy]], Hamilton would most likely support it. In Hamilton's original report on the nation's [[debt]], he excuses the debts from the Revolutionary [[war]] as "noble" because they were the price they paid for liberty.[^13] What is the [[debt]] of today paying for? According to the Tax Policy Center the top one percent get a tax cut of \$51,140 in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, while the [[middle class]] will only get a cut of \$930.[^14] US income inequality has increased the last three decades, and this act only continues that.[^15] So is the [[debt]] from this act, as valuable as the [[debt]] that we paid for our liberty? Hamilton would have to be here to decide.
