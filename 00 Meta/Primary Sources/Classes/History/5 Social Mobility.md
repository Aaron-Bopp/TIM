HOW likely is someone to move up the economic ladder? A new study by Alberto Alesina, Stefanie Stantcheva and Edoardo Teso of Harvard University compares perceptions of social mobility in five countries---[[America]], [[Britain]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and Sweden---against actual levels. It finds that [[America|Americans]] tend to be optimistic, while Europeans tend to be too pessimistic. An American born to a household in the bottom 20% of earnings, for instance, only has a 7.8% chance of reaching the top 20% when they grow up. [[America|Americans]] surveyed thought the probability was 11.7%.

Politically left-leaning respondents are naturally more doubtful about the scale of social mobility, and are more likely to support redistributive [[government]] policies, than conservative ones. But Mr Alesina and his colleagues also find that people of different political stripes also respond differently to new information. When given pessimistic information about social mobility, left-wing respondents became even more likely to support economic redistribution. In contrast, right-wing respondents' support for redistribution did not change. Perhaps, the authors suggest, right-leaning respondents see [[government]] as "the cause of the problem, not the solution".

# The American Dream --- in crisis

By [Erica Pandey](https://www.axios.com/authors/epandey) \-- Jan 25, 2020

**The big picture:** Socioeconomic mobility in the U.S. is at its most sluggish in history. Not only are fewer [[America|Americans]] living better than their [[parents]], but there's also a growing number of people doing worse than their [[parents]].

**By the numbers:**

-   The World Economic Forum [released a report](https://link.axios.com/click/19263260.46832/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vYXBvbmxpbmUvMjAyMC8wMS8xOS9idXNpbmVzcy9hcC1kYXZvcy1mb3J1bS1zb2NpYWwtbW9iaWxpdHkuaHRtbD91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bmV3c2xldHRlcl9heGlvc2Z1dHVyZW9md29yayZzdHJlYW09ZnV0dXJl/5c90f2c505e94e65b176e000Bba0ee74f) this week in Davos that ranked [[America|the United States]] 27th in the world for social mobility. The top five nations were Denmark, Norway, Finland. Sweden and Iceland.

-   In a [recent study](https://link.axios.com/click/19263260.46832/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbG1hbmFjLnVwZW5uLmVkdS9hcnRpY2xlcy91cy1zb2Npb2Vjb25vbWljLXN0YXR1cy1ub3ctaGFyZGVyLXRvLWNoYW5nZT91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bmV3c2xldHRlcl9heGlvc2Z1dHVyZW9md29yayZzdHJlYW09ZnV0dXJl/5c90f2c505e94e65b176e000Bff249764), researchers from UPenn, Northwestern, the University of Nebraska and the Census Bureau looked back as far as 1850 and concluded that socioeconomic mobility in [[America]] is at its worst ever.

-   Per the study, around 60% of people born in the 1940s did better than their [[parents]], compared to 40% of those born in the 1980s.

-   And just 15% of 1940s kids lived *worse* than their [[parents]], compared to 30% of people born in the 1980s.

\"Most [[parents]] expect that their kids will do better than them,\" says Xi Song, a professor at UPenn and one of the researchers. But now that happens for less than half of kids.

**There\'s a stark racial gap** when it comes to mobility, Stanford law professor Ralph Richard Banks [writes](https://link.axios.com/click/19263260.46832/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAxOC8wMy8yMS9vcGluaW9uL2NsYXNzLXJhY2Utc29jaWFsLW1vYmlsaXR5Lmh0bWw_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXJfYXhpb3NmdXR1cmVvZndvcmsmc3RyZWFtPWZ1dHVyZQ/5c90f2c505e94e65b176e000B87a6fd58) in a New York Times op-ed.

-   \"Black boys who grow up rich are twice as likely as their white counterparts to end up poor.\"

-   \"And of those black boys who start life poor, nearly half will remain so in adulthood, while more than 2 in 3 of their white peers will escape the [[poverty]] of their youth.\"

**And mobility depends on where you grow up, too.**

-   [As we reported](https://link.axios.com/click/19263260.46832/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXhpb3MuY29tL25laWdoYm9yaG9vZC1pbmVxdWFsaXR5LWFtZXJpY2FuLWNoaWxkcmVuLTU0OWQ3YWJhLTIzNGQtNGZkOS1iYzE4LWI1NDc4YzUxNDczZC5odG1sP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1uZXdzbGV0dGVyX2F4aW9zZnV0dXJlb2Z3b3JrJnN0cmVhbT1mdXR1cmU/5c90f2c505e94e65b176e000B4d5fa129) earlier this week, kids\' earning potential and life expectancy hinge on the neighborhoods where they were born.

-   \"For moving from the bottom of the income ladder to the top, the South offers the worst odds in [[America|the United States]],\" [per NYT](https://link.axios.com/click/19263260.46832/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vMjAxOS8wNy8wNC9idXNpbmVzcy9lY29ub215L3NvY2lhbC1tb2JpbGl0eS1zb3V0aC5odG1sP3V0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9jYW1wYWlnbj1uZXdzbGV0dGVyX2F4aW9zZnV0dXJlb2Z3b3JrJnN0cmVhbT1mdXR1cmU/5c90f2c505e94e65b176e000Bb3cbd333).

-   On top of that, areas with low social mobility in the U.S. also have larger life expectancy gaps between the rich and the poor, per another UPenn study out this week.

**The bottom line:** Worsening income inequality paired with stagnant socioeconomic mobility is defining today\'s [[America]]. And these trends will impact everything from public health to how people vote in 2020.

By [Matt O\'Brien](http://www.washingtonpost.com/people/matt-obrien) October 18, 2014 Source: Data from Richard Reeves and Isabel Sawhill

[[America]] is the land of opportunity, just for some more than others.

That\'s because, in large part, inequality starts in the crib. Rich [[parents]] can afford to spend more time and money on their kids, and that gap has only grown the past few decades. Indeed, economists [Greg Duncan and Richard Murnane](https://www.russellsage.org/publications/whither-opportunity) calculate that, between 1972 and 2006, high-income [[parents]] increased their spending on \"enrichment activities\" for their children by 151 percent in inflation-adjusted terms, compared to 57 percent for low-income [[parents]].

But, of course, it\'s not just a matter of dollars and cents. It\'s also a matter of letters and words. Affluent [[parents]] talk to their kids [three more hours a week](http://www.democracyjournal.org/30/the-parenting-gap.php?page=all) on average than poor [[parents]], which is critical during a child\'s formative early years. That\'s why, as Stanford professor [Sean Reardon](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/27/no-rich-child-left-behind/) explains, \"rich students are increasingly entering kindergarten much better prepared to succeed in school than middle-class students,\" and they\'re staying that way.

It\'s an educational arms race that\'s leaving many kids far, far behind. It\'s depressing, but not nearly so much as this:

Even poor kids who do everything right don\'t do much better than rich kids who do everything wrong. Advantages and disadvantages, in other words, tend to perpetuate themselves. You can see that in the above chart, based on a new paper from [Richard Reeves and Isabel Sawhill](http://www.bostonfed.org/inequality2014/papers/reeves-sawhill.pdf), presented at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\'s annual conference.

Specifically, rich high school dropouts remain in the top about as much as poor college grads stay stuck in the bottom --- 14 versus 16 percent, respectively. Not only that, but these low-income strivers are just as likely to end up in the bottom as these wealthy ne\'er-do-wells. Some meritocracy.

What\'s going on? Well, it\'s all about glass floors and glass ceilings. Rich kids who can go work for the family [[business]], for example, or inherit the family estate. They don\'t need a high school diploma to get ahead. It\'s an extreme example of what economists call \"[opportunity hoarding](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/the-glass-floor-problem/).\" That includes everything from legacy college admissions to unpaid internships that let affluent [[parents]] rig the game a little more in their children\'s favor.

But even if they didn\'t, low-income kids would still have a hard time getting ahead. That\'s, in part, because they\'re targets for diploma mills that load them up with [[debt]], but not a lot of prospects. And even if they do get a good degree, at least when it comes to black families, they\'re more likely to [still live in impoverished neighborhoods](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/04/desean_jackson_richard_sherman_and_black_american_economic_mobility_why.html) that keep them disconnected from opportunities.

It\'s not quite a heads-I-win, tails-you-lose game where rich kids get better educations, yet still get ahead even if they don\'t---but it\'s close enough. And if it keeps up, the American Dream will be just that.

**With a recycling bin and some scrap paper.**posted on Nov. 21, 2014, at 1:30 p.m.

[Nathan W. Pyle](http://www.buzzfeed.com/nathanwpyle) BuzzFeed Staff

## 1. I once saw a high school teacher lead a simple exercise to teach his class about privilege and social mobility. He started by giving each student a scrap piece of paper and asked them to crumple it up.

![](media/image4.png){width="2.0125in" height="1.4090277777777778in"}2. Then he moved the recycling bin to the front of the room.

## 3. He said, "The game is simple --- you all represent the country's population. And everyone in the country has a chance to become wealthy and move into the upper class."

## 4. "To move into the upper class, all you must do is throw your wadded-up paper into the bin while sitting in your seat."

## 5. The students in the back of the room immediately piped up, "This is unfair!" They could see the rows of students in front of them had a much better chance.

## 9. "Your job --- as students who are receiving an education --- is to be aware of your privilege. And use this particular privilege called "education" to do your best to achieve great things, all the while advocating for those in the rows behind you."

# Class and family in America: Minding the nurture gap

*Social mobility depends on what happens in the first years of life*

**Our Kids: The American Dream in Crisis**. By Robert Putnam. *Simon & Schuster; 386 pages; \$28 and £18.99.*

THE most important divide in [[America]] today is class, not race, and the place where it matters most is in the home. Conservatives have been banging on about family breakdown for decades. Now one of the nation's most prominent liberal scholars has joined the chorus.

Robert Putnam is a former dean of Harvard's Kennedy School of [[government]] and the author of "Bowling Alone" (2000), an influential work that lamented the decline of social capital in [[America]]. In his new book, "Our Kids", he describes the growing gulf between how the rich and the poor raise their children. Anyone who has read "Coming Apart" by Charles Murray will be familiar with the trend, but Mr Putnam adds striking detail and some excellent graphs (pictured). This is a thoughtful and persuasive book.

Among the educated elite the traditional family is thriving: fewer than 10% of births to female college graduates are outside marriage---a figure that is barely higher than it was in 1970. In 2007 among [[women]] with just a high-school [[education]], by contrast, 65% of births were non-marital. Race makes a difference: only 2% of births to white college graduates are out-of-wedlock, compared with 80% among African-[[America|Americans]] with no more than a high-school [[education]], but neither of these figures has changed much since the 1970s. However, the non-marital birth proportion among high-school-educated whites has quadrupled, to 50%, and the same figure for college-educated blacks has fallen by a third, to 25%. Thus the class divide is growing even as the racial gap is shrinking.

Upbringing affects opportunity. Upper-middle-class homes are not only richer (with two professional incomes) and more stable; they are also more nurturing. In the 1970s there were practically no class differences in the amount of time that [[parents]] spent talking, reading and playing with toddlers. Now the children of college-educated [[parents]] receive 50% more of what Mr Putnam calls "Goodnight Moon" time (after a popular book for infants).

Educated [[parents]] engage in a non-stop Socratic dialogue with their children, helping them to make up their own minds about right and wrong, true and false, wise and foolish. This is exhausting, so it helps to have a reliable spouse with whom to share the burden, not to mention cleaners, nannies and cash for trips to the theatre.

Working-class [[parents]], who have less spare capacity, are more likely to demand that their kids simply obey them. In the short run this saves time; in the long run it prevents the kids from learning to organise their own lives or think for themselves. Poor parenting is thus a barrier to social mobility, and is becoming more so as the world grows more complex and the rewards for superior cognitive skills increase.

Mr Putnam's research team interviewed dozens of families to illustrate his thesis. Some of their stories are heart-rending. Stephanie, a mother whose husband left her, is asked if her own [[parents]] were warm. She is "astonished at our naïveté". "No, we don't do all that kissing and hugging," she says. "You can't be mushy in Detroit\...You gotta be hard, really hard, because if you soft, people will bully you." Just as her [[parents]] "beat the hell" out of her, so she "whups" her own children. She does her best, but her ambitions for them go little further than not skipping school, not becoming alcoholic and not ending up on the streets.

At every stage, educated families help their kids in ways that less educated ones do not or cannot. Whereas working-class families have friends who tend to know each other (because they live in the same neighbourhood), professional families have much wider circles. If a problem needs solving or a door needs opening, there is often a friend of a friend (a lawyer, a psychiatrist, an executive) who knows how to do it or whom to ask.

Stunningly, Mr Putnam finds that family background is a better predictor of whether or not a child will graduate from university than 8th-grade test scores. Kids in the richest quarter with low test scores are as likely to make it through college as kids in the poorest quarter with high scores (see chart).

![](media/image6.png){width="6.093055555555556in" height="3.0in"}There are no obvious villains in this story. Mr Murray suggested that the educated classes preach the values they practise by urging the poor to get married before they have children. But the record of those who tell other people how to arrange their [[love]] lives is hardly encouraging. Both George W. Bush and Barack [[Obama]] preached the virtues of responsible fatherhood, to no obvious effect.

Mr Putnam sees "no clear path to reviving marriage" among the poor. Instead, he suggests a grab-bag of policies to help poor kids reach their potential, such as raising subsidies for poor families, teaching them better parenting skills, improving nursery care and making after-school baseball clubs free. He urges all 50 states to experiment to find out what works. A problem this complex has no simple solution.

#### Back to school statistics

**College and University [[Education]]**

*Enrollment*

The number of students projected to attend American colleges and universities in fall 2018 is 19.9 million, which is higher than the enrollment of 15.3 million students in fall 2000... Females are expected to account for the majority of college and university students in fall 2018: about 11.2 million females will attend in fall 2018, compared with 8.7 million males.

*Postsecondary Demographics*: Higher numbers and percentages of Black and Hispanic students are attending colleges and universities. The percentage of all students attending colleges and universities who were Black was higher in 2016 than in 2000 (13.7 vs. 11.7 percent), and the percentage who were Hispanic rose from 9.9 to 18.2 percent over the same time period [(source)](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d17/tables/dt17_306.10.asp).

*Postsecondary Finance:* For the 2016--17 academic year, the average annual price for undergraduate tuition, fees, room, and board was \$17,237 at public institutions, \$44,551 at private nonprofit institutions, and \$25,431 at private for-profit institutions. Charges for tuition and required fees averaged \$6,817 at public institutions, \$32,556 at private nonprofit institutions, and \$14,419 at private for-profit institutions [(source)](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d17/tables/dt17_330.10.asp).

*Labor Force Outcomes:* In 2016, about 78.8 percent of 25- to 34-year-olds with a bachelor\'s or higher degree in the labor force had year-round, full-time jobs, compared with 72.3 percent of those with an associate\'s degree, 69.5 percent of those with some college [[education]], 68.9 percent of those who completed high school, and 60.1 percent of those without a high school diploma or its equivalent [(source)](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d17/tables/dt17_502.30.asp). In 2017, the [[unemployment]] rate for 25- to 34-year-olds with a bachelor's or higher degree (2.5 percent) was lower than the rate for young adults with some college (4.4 percent), those who had completed high school (7.2 percent), and those who had not completed high school (13.2 percent) [(source)](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d17/tables/dt17_501.80.asp).

In 2016, for young adults ages 25--34 who worked full time, year round, higher educational attainment was associated with higher median earnings; this pattern was consistent from 2000 through 2016. For example, in 2016, the median earnings of young adults with a bachelor\'s degree (\$50,000) were 57 percent higher than those of young adult high school completers (\$31,800). The median earnings of young adult high school completers were 26 percent higher than those of young adults who did not complete high school (\$25,400). In addition, in 2016, the median earnings of young adults with a master\'s or higher degree were \$64,100, some 28 percent higher than those of young adults with a bachelor\'s degree (\$50,000) [(source)](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cba.asp).

### An hereditary meritocracy

# The children of the rich and powerful are increasingly well suited to earning wealth and power themselves. That's a problem

Jan 24th 2015 \| WASHINGTON, DC \| [From the print edition](http://www.economist.com/printedition/2015-01-24)

...Before the word meritocracy was coined by Michael Young, a British sociologist and institutional entrepreneur, in the [[1950s]] there was a different name for the notion that power, success and wealth should be distributed according to talent and diligence, rather than by accident of birth: American. For sure, [[America]] has always had rich and powerful families, from the floor of the Senate to the boardrooms of the steel industry. But it has also held more fervently than any other country the belief that all comers can penetrate that elite as long as they have talent, perseverance and gumption.

Some [[self]]-perpetuation by elites is unavoidable; the children of [[America]]'s top dogs benefit from nepotism just as those in all other societies do. But something else is now afoot. More than ever before, [[America]]'s elite is producing children who not only get ahead, but deserve to do so: they meet the standards of meritocracy better than their peers, and are thus worthy of the status they inherit.

It takes two

![](media/image12.png){width="2.6559459755030623in" height="2.446153762029746in"}This is partly the result of various admirable aspects of American society: the willingness of people to give money and time to their children's schools; a reluctance to impose a uniform model of [[education]] across the country; competition between universities to build the most lavish facilities. Such traits are hard to object to, and even if one does object they are yet harder to do anything about. In aggregate, though, they increase the chances of wealthy [[parents]] passing advantage on to their children. In the long run that could change the way the country works, the way it thinks about itself, and the way that people elsewhere judge its claim to be an exceptional beacon of opportunity.

Part of the change is due to the increased opportunities for [[education]] and employment won by American [[women]] in the twentieth century. A larger pool of [[women]] enjoying academic and professional success, or at least showing early signs of doing so, has made it easier for pairs of young adults who will both excel to get together. Between 1960 and 2005 the share of men with university degrees who married [[women]] with university degrees nearly doubled, from 25% to 48%, and the change shows no sign of going into reverse.

Assortative mating of this sort seems likely, on average, to reinforce the traits that bring the couple together. Though genes play a role in the variation of intelligence from person to person, this is not a crude genetic determinism. People tend to encourage in their children what they value in themselves and their partners. Thus people bought together by their [[education]] and status will typically deem such things important and do more to bring them out in their children, both deliberately and by lived example---processes in which nature and nurture are more than likely to work hand in hand.

Not only do graduate couples tend to value [[education]]; they also tend to have money to spend on it. And though the best predictor of an American child's success in school has long been the [[parents]]' educational level---a factor which graduates are already ahead on, by defintition---money is an increasingly important factor. According to Sean Reardon of Stanford the past decades have seen a growing correlation between parental income and children's test scores. Sort the students who took the SAT, a test for college applicants, in 2014 by parental income and the results get steadily better the further up the ladder you climb (see chart 1).

First, cultivate your kindergarten

Another factor is family stability. Wealthier and better educated American families tend to marry before having children, and like most married couples they split up less than unmarried ones. This correlates with various good outcomes for their children.

The educational benefits of being born to wealthy [[parents]] are already clear in toddlers (see [[article]{.ul}](http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21640315-early-[[education]]-matters-it-not-everything-getting-em-young)). Families which are used to and eager for success try to build on them at kindergarten. Competition for private kindergarten places among high-status New Yorkers is farcically intense. Jennifer Brozost of Peas, an educational consultancy, recommends that [[parents]] apply to 8-10 kindergartens, write "[[love]] letters" to their top three, and bone up on how to make the right impression when visiting. Some [[parents]] pay for sessions at which their children are coached on how to play in a way that pleases those in charge of admissions.

![](media/image13.png){width="2.9722222222222223in" height="6.004861111111111in"}Once children enter the public school system---which about 90% of them do---the advantages of living in a well-off neighbourhood kick in. [[America]] is unusual in funding its public schools through property taxes. States have a floor price for the [[education]] of each child, but [[parents]] can vote to pay more local tax in order to top this up, and frequently do. Funding levels per pupil can vary by up to 50% across a state, says Mike McShane of the American Enterprise Institute, a think-tank.

Sometimes this results in poor students in cities that collect lots of property tax being better funded than the children of wealthier families in the suburbs. More often, though, the opposite is true. The result is that [[America]] is one of only three advanced countries that spends more on richer pupils than poor ones, according to the OECD (the other two are Turkey and [[Israel]]). And on top of spending on school, there is spending outside it: the gap between what rich and poor [[parents]] shell out for museum trips, music lessons, books and so on has been widening (see "... But it's not fair," Chart 2, previous page). In a world where lots of people do well on SATs, cultivating extra skills matters.

The opportunities for parental investment continue in higher [[education]], which is ever more costly (see chart 3, previous page) but offers ever greater returns. Between 1979 and 2012 the income gap between the median family with college-educated [[parents]] and one with high-school educated [[parents]] grew four times greater than the headline-grabbing income gap between the top 1% of earners and the rest, according to David Autor of MIT, rising from \$30,000 to \$58,000.

Those whose [[parents]] have provided good schooling and good after-schooling have advantages already---but some get an extra one from institutions that discriminate in favour of the children of alumni. According to a survey by the *Crimson*, Harvard's newspaper, 16% of the 2,023 who got in last year had at least one parent among the university's alumni. Harvard says that legacy preference is only ever a tie breaker in admissions; but with 17 applicants for every place there can be a lot of ties.

All this and lacrosse too

Most of the country's research universities and liberal arts colleges grant preferences to legacy students; the practice seems widespread at universities just below the top tier. The University of Pennsylvania is particularly friendly to the children of alumni, says Katherine Cohen of Ivywise, a firm with several ex-deans of admissions on its books which provides advice on getting children into the best schools. Though it is rare, stories still crop up of the [[parents]] of academically borderline students buying admission for their children with a generous bequest to a particular school.

The fierce competition between universities to build endowments makes doing such favours for alumni enticing. And there is a public-good argument for it: a student who comes with \$1m attached can pay for financial aid for many others. But in practice this is not how the system works. While it is true that some elite universities are rich enough to give out a lot of financial support, people who can pay the full whack are still at the centre of the [[business]] model for many. Mitchell Stevens, a Stanford sociologist who spent a year working in the admissions office of an unnamed liberal arts college in the north-east, found that the candidate the system most prized was one who could pay full tuition and was just good enough to make one of the higher-profile sports teams but had a strong enough academic record not to eat into the annual allocation reserved for students whose brains work best when encased in a football helmet.

On graduation, many members of [[America]]'s future elite will head for the law firms, banks and consultancies where starting salaries are highest. Lauren Rivera of Kellogg School of Management interviewed 120 people charged with hiring in these sectors for a forthcoming book. She found that though they did not set out to recruit students from wealthy backgrounds, the companies had a penchant for graduates who had been to well-known universities and played varsity sports (lacrosse correlates with success particularly well). The result was a graduate intake that included people with skin of every shade but rarely anyone with [[parents]] who worked blue-collar jobs. "When we are asked to identify merit," explains Ms Rivera, "we tend to find people like ourselves."

Something similar has happened in corner offices of [[America]]'s biggest companies. As computing power has increased and clerical jobs have been automated, the distance between the shop floor and executive positions has increased. It was never common for people to start at the bottom and work their way to the top. Now it is close to impossible. Research by Nitin Nohria, the dean of Harvard [[Business]] School, and his colleagues has shown how in the second half of the 20th century a corporate elite where family networks and [[religion]] mattered most was replaced by one whose members required an MBA or similar qualification from a [[business]] school. This makes the managers better qualified. It also means they are the product of a serial filtering that has winnowed their numbers at school, college and work before they get their MBAs.

More than 50 years ago Michael Young warned that the incipient meritocracy to which he had given a name could be as narrow and pernicious, in its way, as aristocracies of old. In [[America]] some academics and thinkers on [[the left]] are coming to similar conclusions.

# *Extensive Data Shows Punishing Reach of Racism for Black Boys*

**By [EMILY BADGER](https://www.nytimes.com/by/emily-badger), [CLAIRE CAIN MILLER](http://www.nytimes.com/by/claire-cain-miller), [ADAM PEARCE](https://www.nytimes.com/by/adam-pearce) and [KEVIN QUEALY](http://www.nytimes.com/by/kevin-quealy) **

MARCH 19, 2018

Black boys raised in [[America]], even in the wealthiest families and living in some of the most well-to-do neighborhoods, still earn less in adulthood than white boys with similar backgrounds, according to a sweeping new study that traced the lives of millions of children.

White boys who grow up rich are likely to remain that way. Black boys raised at the top, however, are more likely to become poor than to stay wealthy in their own adult households.

Most white boys  raised in wealthy families will stay rich or upper [[middle class]] as adults, but black boys  raised in similarly rich households will not.

Grew up rich

Adult outcomes reflect household incomes in 2014 and 2015.

Even when children grow up next to each other with [[parents]] who earn similar incomes, black boys fare worse than white boys in 99 percent of [[America]]. And the gaps only worsen in the kind of neighborhoods that promise low [[poverty]] and good schools.

According to the study, led by researchers at Stanford, Harvard and the Census Bureau, income inequality between blacks and whites is driven entirely by [what is happening among these boys](http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/assets/documents/race_summary.pdf) and the men they become. Though black girls and [[women]] face deep inequality on many measures, black and white girls from families with comparable earnings attain similar individual incomes as adults.

Large income gaps persist between men --- but not [[women]].

Black men consistently earn less than white men, regardless of whether they're raised poor or rich. No such income gap exists between black and white [[women]] raised in similar households. "You would have thought at some point you escape the [[poverty]] trap," said Nathaniel Hendren, a Harvard economist and an author of the study. Black boys --- even rich black boys --- can seemingly never assume that.

[The study](http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/), based on anonymous earnings and demographic data for virtually all [[America|Americans]] now in their late 30s, debunks a number of other widely held hypotheses about income inequality. Gaps persisted even when black and white boys grew up in families with the same income, similar family structures, similar [[education]] levels and even similar levels of accumulated wealth.

The disparities that remain also can't be explained by differences in cognitive ability, an argument made by people who cite racial gaps in test scores that appear for both black boys and girls. If such inherent differences existed by race, "you've got to explain to me why these putative ability differences aren't handicapping [[women]]," said David Grusky, a Stanford sociologist who has reviewed the research.

A more likely possibility, the authors suggest, is that test scores don't accurately measure the abilities of black children in the first place.

If this inequality can't be explained by individual or household traits, much of what matters probably lies outside the home --- in surrounding neighborhoods, in the [[economy]] and in a society that views black boys differently from white boys, and even from black girls.

"One of the most popular liberal post-racial ideas is the idea that the fundamental problem is class and not race, and clearly this study explodes that idea," said Ibram Kendi, a professor and director of the Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American University. "But for whatever reason, we're unwilling to stare [[racism]] in the face."

The authors, including the Stanford economist Raj Chetty and two census researchers, Maggie R. Jones and Sonya R. Porter, tried to identify neighborhoods where poor black boys do well, and as well as whites.

"The problem," Mr. Chetty said, "is that there are essentially no such neighborhoods in [[America]]."

The few neighborhoods that met this standard were in areas that showed less discrimination in surveys and tests of racial bias. They mostly had low [[poverty]] rates. And, intriguingly, these pockets --- including parts of the Maryland suburbs of Washington, and corners of Queens and the Bronx --- were the places where many lower-income black children had fathers at home. Poor black boys did well in such places, whether their own fathers were present or not.

**Share of children living in low-[[poverty]] neighborhoods with many fathers present** 63% of white kids / 4% of black kids

**Share of children living in high-[[poverty]] neighborhoods with few fathers present** 1% of white kids / 66% of black kids

"That is a pathbreaking finding," said William Julius Wilson, a Harvard sociologist whose books have chronicled the economic struggles of black men. "They're not talking about the direct effects of a boy's own [[parents]]' marital status. They're talking about the presence of fathers in a given census tract."

Other fathers in the community can provide boys with role models and mentors, researchers say, and their presence may indicate other neighborhood factors that benefit families, like lower incarceration rates and better job opportunities.

The research makes clear that there is something unique about the obstacles black males face. The gap between Hispanics and whites is narrower, and their incomes will converge within a couple of generations if mobility stays the same. Asian-[[America|Americans]] earn more than whites raised at the same income level, or about the same when first-generation immigrants are excluded. Only Native [[America|Americans]] have an income gap comparable to African-[[America|Americans]]. But the disparities are widest for black boys.

For poor children, the pattern is reversed. Most poor black boys  will remain poor as adults. White boys  raised in poor families fare far better.

Grew up poor

"This crystallizes and puts data behind this thing that we always knew was there because we either felt it ourselves or we've seen it over time," said Will Jawando, 35, who worked in the [[Obama]] White House on [My Brother's Keeper](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/node/279811#section-about-my-brothers-keeper), a mentoring initiative for black boys. Even without this data, the people who worked on that project, he said, believed that individual and structural [[racism]] targeted black men in ways that required policies devised specifically for them.

Mr. Jawando, the son of a Nigerian father and a white mother, grew up poor in Silver Spring, Md. The Washington suburb contains some of the rare neighborhoods where black and white boys appear to do equally well. Mr. Jawando, who identifies as black, is now a married lawyer with three daughters. He is among the black boys who climbed from the bottom to the top.

He was one of the 20 million children born between 1978 and 1983 whose lives are reflected in the study. Using census data that included tax files, the researchers were able to link the adult fortunes of those children to their [[parents]]' incomes. Names and addresses were hidden from the researchers.

Previous research suggests some reasons there may be a large income gap between black and white men, but not between [[women]], even though [[women]] of color face both sexism and [[racism]].

Other studies show that [boys, across races](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/22/upshot/a-disadvantaged-start-hurts-boys-more-than-girls.html), are more sensitive than girls to disadvantages like growing up in [[poverty]] or facing discrimination. While black [[women]] also face negative effects of [[racism]], black men often experience racial discrimination differently. As [early as preschool](http://ziglercenter.yale.edu/publications/briefs.aspx), they are more likely to be disciplined in school. They are pulled over or detained and searched by police officers more often.

"It's not just being black but being male that has been hyper-stereotyped in this negative way, in which we've made black men scary, intimidating, with a propensity toward violence," said Noelle Hurd, a psychology professor at the University of Virginia.

She said this racist stereotype particularly hurts black men economically, now that service-sector jobs, requiring interaction with customers, have replaced the manufacturing jobs that previously employed men with less [[education]].

The new data shows that 21 percent of black men raised at the very bottom were incarcerated, according to a snapshot of a single day during the 2010 census. Black men raised in the top 1 percent --- by millionaires --- were as likely to be incarcerated as white men raised in households earning about \$36,000.

The sons of black families from the top 1 percent had about the same chance of being incarcerated on a given day as the sons of white families earning \$36,000.

At the same time, [boys benefit more](http://www.nber.org/papers/w17541) than girls from adult attention and resources, as do low-income and nonwhite children, a [variety](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2940620) of[ studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1449212/) have found. Mentors who aren't children's [[parents]], but who share those children's [[gender]] and race, serve a particularly important role for black children, Ms. Hurd has [found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2752426/). That helps explain why the presence of black fathers in a neighborhood, even if not in a child's home, appears to make a difference.

Some of the widest black-white income gaps in this study appear in wealthy communities. This fits with [previous](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20063978?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) [research](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2083415?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) that has shown that the [effects](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17274219) of racial discrimination [cross class lines](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-soc-081309-150047). Although all children [benefit](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/04/upshot/an-atlas-of-upward-mobility-shows-paths-out-of-[[poverty]].html) from growing up in places with higher incomes and more resources, black children do not benefit nearly as much as white children do. Moving black boys to opportunity is no guarantee they can tap into it.

"Simply because you're in an area that is more affluent, it's still hard for black boys to present themselves as independent from the stereotype of black criminality," said Khiara Bridges, a professor of law and anthropology at Boston University who has written a coming paper on discrimination against affluent [[black people]].

This dynamic still weighs on Mr. Jawando. He has a good income, multiple degrees and political aspirations --- he is running for county council in Montgomery County, where he grew up. But in his own community, he is careful to dress like a professional.

"I think if I'm putting on a sweatsuit, if I go somewhere, will I be seen as just kind of a hood black guy?" he said. "Or will people recognize me at all?" Those small daily decisions --- to wear a blazer or not --- follow him despite his success. "I don't think you escape those things," he said.

## OTHER FINDINGS FROM THE RESEARCH

This study makes it possible to look in greater detail at interrelated disparities that researchers have long studied around income, marriage rates and incarceration. Here are some of the other findings.

There's a large gap in the marriage rates of white and black [[America|Americans]], even after accounting for income.

One reason income gaps between whites and blacks appear so large at the household level is that black men and [[women]] are less likely to be married. That means their households are more likely to have a single income --- not two. For this reason and others, many point to differences in family structure as a primary driver of racial income inequality. If black children don't have married [[parents]], the argument goes, they're more likely to grow up with fewer resources and less adult attention at home.

This study found, however, that broad income disparities still exist between black and white men even when they're raised in homes with the same incomes *and* the same family structure.

The income gap exists for black and white boys if they had one parent in the house or two. A black man raised by two [[parents]] together in the 90th percentile --- making around \$140,000 a year --- earns about the same in adulthood as a white man raised by a single mother making \$60,000 alone.

The high mobility rate for Asian-[[America|Americans]] is partly about immigration. Asian-[[America|Americans]] earn more in adulthood than whites who were raised in families with similar incomes. But that advantage largely disappears when the researchers look only at children whose [[parents]] were born in [[America|the United States]]. Non-immigrant Asian-[[America|Americans]] fare about as well in the [[economy]] as whites. (The study did not divide immigrant mothers into smaller groups by origin.)

The worst places for poor white children are almost all better than the best places for poor black children.

In previous work, some of these same researchers looked at how the prospects for poor children vary depending on where they grow up. The middle map above shows those earlier results: Poor children appeared to have less opportunity in the Southeast and more in the Northern Great Plains. With the new data, it's now possible to look at the effects of geography separately for blacks and whites.

Poor white children struggle in parts of the Southeast and Appalachia. But they still fare better there than poor black children do in most of [[America]]. In effect, the worst places for whites produce outcomes that are about as good as the best places for blacks. These new maps also suggest that part of the reason the Southeast looks bad for *all* children, in the middle map, is that the region is home to many black children who fare particularly poorly there.

Very few nonwhite [[America|Americans]] started at the very top.

African-[[America|Americans]] made up about 35 percent of all children raised in the bottom 1 percent of the income distribution. They made up less than 1 percent of the children at the very top. This picture captures both a source of racial inequality and a consequence of it. White children are more likely to start life with economic advantages. But we now know that even when they start with the same advantages as black children, white boys still fare better, only reinforcing the disparities seen here.

## The Real Starting Positions

The ladder charts so far have shown equal numbers of black and white boys raised by rich or poor families --- what would happen, in other words, if we started with 10,000 boys, and half were black and half white.

In reality, whites and blacks are not represented equally across the income spectrum. More than two-thirds of black boys are raised by poor or lower-middle-class families, while more than half of white boys are raised by rich or upper-middle-class families. The chart below depicts boys from every income quintile -- not just the top or bottom ones -- proportioned according to their real starting places in life.

# Planet Money: Moving To Opportunity?

September 6, 20194:57 PM ET Heard on [All Things Considered](https://www.npr.org/programs/all-things-considered/2019/09/06/758205150) [KAREN DUFFIN](https://www.npr.org/people/605383101/karen-duffin)

*How much does where you live affect your shot at the American Dream? An overlooked [[government]] program from the nineties tried to answer that question. Recently, it has been getting new attention.*

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: The American dream is supposed to go like this - with the right effort, a person or family can climb from the bottom of the economic ladder to the top. Study after study shows that\'s getting harder to do. So Karen Duffin from our Planet Money podcast went looking for [[government]] programs that might help change that.

KAREN DUFFIN, BYLINE: Once upon a time, in a cubicle not so far away, sat a [[government]] bureaucrat in his [[government]]-issued chair.

MARK SHRODER: I was new to HUD. This was, like, my first couple months of HUD.

DUFFIN: This is Mark Shroder, and HUD is the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Shroder was an economist there in 1991, when HUD was trying to test a theory - could they improve a family\'s odds of climbing the economic ladder just by moving them to a better neighborhood? It would be a big social experiment, and they would call it Moving to Opportunity.

SHRODER: Almost everything about Moving to Opportunity has been a surprise, not only to me but to practically everybody else.

DUFFIN: Here\'s how the experiment worked - HUD chose thousands of families who lived in public housing in five big cities.

SHRODER: Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York.

DUFFIN: They split the families into three groups, by lottery, and one of these groups was required to move out of public housing into, specifically, a low-[[poverty]] neighborhood. The [[government]] would help them cover rent in that new neighborhood by way of what\'s known as a Section 8 voucher. So this should be a better neighborhood, hopefully more opportunity. But not everyone saw it that way.

SHRODER: There were some people who were praying, literally praying, they would be in the regular voucher group.

DUFFIN: Was that disappointing?

SHRODER: That wasn\'t that surprising.

DUFFIN: Historically, families who\'d gotten Section 8 vouchers were not using them to move to lower-[[poverty]] areas for a lot of complex reasons, both personal and systemic. But thousands of families did sign up, and for four years, they moved. HUD gathered data on them, and then in 2008, HUD tallied the data.

SHRODER: We did not find any impacts on earnings or children\'s test scores.

DUFFIN: HUD\'s theory was wrong. The moves had basically no economic or educational impact. And this was a landmark study, so researchers took the findings and moved their hopes, dollars and programs elsewhere - basically stopped looking at housing as a way to fix the American dream. But then about six years later, another economist was studying upward mobility.

NATHAN HENDREN: My name is Nathan Hendren. I am a professor of [[economy|economics]] at Harvard.

DUFFIN: Hendren and a few of his research pals were combing through income tax data when they spotted a pattern that surprised them.

HENDREN: We started to see these exposure effect patterns; that the longer a child spent in a neighborhood with higher rates of upward mobility, the higher their outcomes were in adulthood.

DUFFIN: But that contradicted what that big HUD study found. As they dug deeper, they realized HUD had stopped looking at the data too soon. The younger kids who moved to opportunity just hadn\'t started getting jobs by then.

HENDREN: Back in 2008, you wouldn\'t have seen it. There just weren\'t enough young children into the labor market where you\'d really be able to say, ah, looks like there\'s an effect here.

DUFFIN: But for kids who moved before they turned 13\...

HENDREN: The children were 4 percentage points more likely to go to college, had about 30% higher earnings.

DUFFIN: And bonus - these kids will likely pay more in income tax over time, so the program should essentially pay for itself.

HENDREN: You could kind of feel that we had something that was going to change the way people thought about equality of opportunity in [[America|the United States]].

DUFFIN: Hendren and his colleagues decided to not just release data but to turn it into an actual program. They\'re currently working with cities to basically reboot the original HUD program, starting in Seattle. [[Congress]] also just passed a bipartisan law to run programs like this. And the researchers hope that, over time, they can take what they learned from the families that moved to opportunity and move that opportunity back into the neighborhoods they left behind.
