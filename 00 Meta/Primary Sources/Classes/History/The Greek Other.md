The Greek "Other" Critical Reflection Essay

In the ancient world, the view of the "other" was often the view of the "inferior." This is to say that no matter the culture they would view any other culture as inferior to their own. This was compounded by the naturality of hierarchies in ancient culture. Greek culture placed a heavy emphasis on language as a way to establish and maintain [[morality]]. This meant that a lack of shared language was a major factor in their view of the "other." The Greeks placed their view of the "other" on three things, language, culture, and biology.

As early as Hammurabi we see rulers trying to ingrain their power into the culture. In general, these hierarchies would be the gods, followed by a ruler who is empowered by or is a god, then the men, and then [[women]], slaves, and foreigners. This is seen followed in Greece where only the Greek men could take part in democracy, and the [[women]] and foreigners could not. The greeks did allow some foreigners to live in their lands, but that does not stop them from viewing most foreigners and especially the "barbarians" as very much inferior to themselves.

In the early stages of Greek culture, they identified with the people they would spend most of their time with, the people that lived in their polis. Some polis had a larger pull than others. Athens and Sparta were very prominent, and their history is one that is often focused on today. We see this identification in Thucydides *History of the Peloponnesian [[War]],* II.34-46, "I doubt if the world can produce a man who, where he has only himself to depend upon, is equal to so many emergencies, and graced by so happy a versatility, as the Athenian."

Language is the means through which you can establish reason, truth, and [[morality]]. If you do not share language you cannot establish a shared [[morality]] and thus cannot provide context to your actions. This was as true for the ancient Greeks as it is today. They prided themselves on their forums for discussion and democracy. This priority is reflected in their view of the "other." Barbarian is the word most commonly used to define people different from the greeks, and it originated as a word meaning those who speak a different language. (Dawn Gilley, \"The Ancient Greek View of the \'Other\',\" September 15, 2020.)

A lack of a shared language can only exacerbate the other two elements of otherness. If you do not share a language, you cannot come to understand the traditions of another culture. In the *Dissoi Logoi 2.9-18,* they make a variety of judgments based on the traditions of different cultures including things as minor as girls "walking bare-armed" or Thessalians training horses and mules themselves. Even today, many of the things mentioned in the *Dissoi Logoi* could vary in acceptance across the world such as sex before marriage and prostitution. This shows that Greeks would quickly make value judgements of other cultures based on their actions.

These first two factors, language and culture, are different than the third factor of Greek otherness. Language can be learned. The ancient Greeks had many examples of foreigners living and working in Greece. These people were able to live there because they spoke Greek and could take part in that society. Culture can be explained. While on the surface actions may seem unseemly, given some context those actions can be understood and with time accepted or corrected. Aristotle implies this when he said, "he who participates in rational principle enough to apprehend, but not to have, such a principle, is a slave by nature."(Aristotle's Theory of Natural Slavery (Politics 1254b-16-21) He attaches the nature of a slave to the rejection of a principle, not a biological factor like race. This third factor is the dirtiest because it cannot be changed.

Biological race as a basis of inferiority was not as commonplace in the ancient world as it is a day. The ancient world was much more homogenous, so inferiority was based on different aspects. In Greece biology was only starting to be used as a way to impart inferiority onto others. The first example of this is when a student of Aristotle wrote the Physiognomica, which states that that olive skin is superior (Dawn Gilley, \"The Ancient Greek View of the \'Other\'.\") and makes a variety of other judgments based on purely physiological traits (\[Aristotle\], Physiognomica 5). The Greeks were smart enough to see the reasons behind the difference in biology as we see in Hippocrates' *Airs, Water, Places* 23, "in the other races in [[Europe]] differ from one another, both as to stature and shape, owing to the changes of the seasons." This relates biological difference to the seasons and thus people\'s geographical location. Unfortunately, Hippocrates turns around and attributes a non-physical attribute to geography just a few lines later, "I think the inhabitants of [[Europe]] more courageous than those of Asia." (Hippocrates' *Airs, Water, Places* 23)

In today's society, we still use all three of these things as ways of grouping people as the "other." People will commonly say "speak English" and "go back to where you came from" when confronted with people that don't talk and act like them. However, biological differences and the social construct of race have become the primary way that people are grouped. People are commonly stereotyped based on their skin color even when they have never taken part in the society that stereotype was created about. People will repeatedly make the same mistake Hippocrates made, and take a psychological aspect and associate it with biology or geography.
