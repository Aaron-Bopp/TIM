<https://www.ago.mo.gov/home/vehicle-stops-report/2018-executive-summary>

Nearly two decades ago, in 2000, the Missouri General Assembly created the Annual Vehicle Stop Report in an effort to provide important data regarding law enforcement in our State. The information in the report can help inform our debates on some of the most pressing public-policy issues facing our State, ones that implicate both the safety of our communities and the equality of all persons before the law. I am hopeful that this year's report will continue to foster constructive conversations about what we must do together to achieve---and protect---the rule of law in Missouri\...\
 \
BACKGROUND

Concerns raised by the citizens of Missouri and the General Assembly regarding allegations of **racial profiling by law enforcement** prompted the passage in 2000 of [Section 590.650, RSMo](http://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=590.650&bid=30357&hl=). That statute requires that all peace officers report specific information---including a driver's race---for each vehicle stop made in the State. Law-enforcement agencies must provide the data to the Attorney General by March 1, and the Attorney General is required to compile the data and report to the Governor no later than June 1 of each year. The Governor may withhold state funds from any agency that does not comply with these requirements.

**STATEWIDE FINDINGS**

This report summarizes the data from law enforcement agencies in Missouri for calendar year 2018...

**1. Disparity [[Index]]**

The first summary metric is the \"disparity index\" and it relates each racial/ethnic group's proportion of total traffic stops to its proportion of the driving-age (16+) population. A value of 1 indicates that a group's proportion of vehicle stops equals its population proportion: it is neither \"under-represented\" nor \"over-represented.\" Values above 1 indicate over-representation, and those below 1 indicate under-representation in traffic stops.

For example, the 1,177,844 whites who were stopped accounted for 76.5% of all vehicle stops in 2018. Whites comprise an estimated 82.8% of Missouri's driving age population. Therefore, the value for whites on the disparity [[index]] is .92 (.765/.828). As this value is below 1, whites were stopped at slightly below the rate expected based on their portion of the population age 16 and older from the 2010 Census.

The same is not the case for several other groups. Blacks represent 10.9% of Missouri's driving-age population but 19.2% of all vehicle stops, for a disparity [[index]] of 1.76. This means that Blacks were stopped at a rate 76% greater than expected based upon their portion of the population sixteen and older. Hispanics (0.77), Asians (0.56), [[Native American|American Indians]] (0.32), and persons of mixed or unknown race (0.71) were stopped at rates well below an expectation based upon their portion of the driving-age population.

The values on the disparity [[index]] for the different groups can be compared directly to one another by dividing their values. For example, the likelihood that a black motorist was stopped is 1.91 times that of a white motorist (1.76/.92). In other words, blacks were 91% more likely than whites to be stopped based on their respective proportions of the Missouri driving-age population in the 2010 Census.

**2. [[Search]] Rate**

A second metric that can be used to assess bias in traffic enforcement is the \"[[search]] rate,\" or the number of searches divided by the number of stops (x 100). Searches include both searches of drivers and searches of the vehicle and property within.

The [[search]] rate for all motorists who were stopped in 2018 was 6.60%. Asians were searched at a rate well below the statewide average (2.90%), while Blacks (8.93%) and Hispanics (8.44%) were searched at rates above the average for all motorists who were stopped. Whites were searched at a rate below the state average at 6.04%. The [[search]] rate for racial/ethnic groups can also be directly compared with one another. Blacks were 1.48 times more likely to be searched than whites (8.93/6.04). Hispanics were 1.40 times more likely than whites to be searched (8.44/6.04).

**3. Contraband Hit Rate**

The third summary metric, the \"contraband hit rate,\" reflects the percentage of searches in which contraband is found. Contraband was found in 35.0% of all searches conducted in 2018. There is some variation, however, in the contraband hit rate across racial/ethnic groups.

The contraband hit rate for whites was 35.7%, compared with 33.8% for Blacks and 29.2% for Hispanics. This means that, on average, searches of Blacks and Hispanics are less likely than searches of whites to result in the discovery of contraband.

**4. Arrest Rate**

The \"arrest rate\" is the fourth summary metric included in Table 1 that may be useful for assessing bias in traffic enforcement. Statewide, 4.68% of all traffic stops resulted in an arrest (72,017/1,539,477). The probability of arrest varies across racial and ethnic groups.

Approximately 6.37% of the stops of Blacks and 6.26% of the stops of Hispanics resulted in arrest, compared with about 4.25% of the stops of whites. Asians (2.31%), [[Native American|American Indians]] (4.17%), and people of mixed or unknown race (3.31%) had lower arrest rates than whites. The dynamic of Blacks and Hispanics being arrested at a higher rate than whites likely affects the discrepancies in [[search]] and contraband hit rates as described above. 

# Taking a knee: Why are NFL players protesting and when did they start to kneel?

Critics say Colin Kaepernick\'s gesture is \'unpatriotic\' and that sport should be clear of [[politics]] but athletes have often used their platform to protest in the past

Tuesday 4 September 2018 08:06 

[Colin Kaepernick](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/colin-kaepernick), the American football star who started the "take a knee" national anthem protest against police brutality has been named as the new face of [Nike](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Nike)'s "Just Do It" campaign for its 30th anniversary. Kaepernick remains a free agent without a team at present, however, as the [NFL ](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/NFL)appears reluctant to endorse his controversial gesture. Nike's move has already sparked a protest from angry consumers who consider the quarterback's stance "unpatriotic", destroying the brand's products and venting their displeasure on social [[media]].

But the move to take a knee during the national anthem before kick-off - or stand with arms locked in silent protest - follows in a long tradition of sports stars standing up for what they believe to be right, despite many believing that doing so is unpatriotic and that [[politics]] should be kept out of sports. Here's what you need to know.

![](media/image3.jpeg){width="2.1840277777777777in" height="1.2277777777777779in"}**When did this all start?**

Kaepernick's protest was not immediately noticed. At that point, he simply sat on the benches during [[America|the US]] national anthem during a preseason game, just next to some giant Gatorade jugs. But he later transitioned to taking a knee in protest --- saying he was doing so to show more respect for military veterans --- which turned out to be the much more iconic pose. Several other players joined his protest, even though they received a lot of criticism from football fans who said that it was disrespectful to [[America|the United States]]. Still, the movement did not gain huge traction that year. "I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses [[black people]] and people of colour," Kaepernick said in a press conference after first sitting out during the anthem. "To me, this is bigger than football, and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder."

**What was the context surrounding those first [[protests]]?**

Police brutality has become an incredibly polarising and contentious issue in American life. This has come as a result of repeated videos showing police shooting and killing unarmed black men, which have been posted online and gone viral --- illustrating the brutality that [[black people]] in [[America]] must contend with when dealing with some police officers, who often do not serve any [[prison]] time for pulling the trigger.

**Why it gained steam?**

Mr Trump became a catalyst for the protest in September 2017 when he said during a campaign rally in Alabama that he wished that NFL players would be fired for kneeling during the national anthem. "Wouldn't you [[love]] to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a b\*\*\*\* off the field right now, out, he's fired. He's fired,'" Mr Trump said.

"You know, some owner is going to do that. He's going to say, 'That guy that disrespects our flag, he's fired.' And that owner, they don't know it \[but\] they'll be the most popular person in this country."

**Who is [[Protests|protesting]]?**

Some football teams chose not to come out onto the field at all after Mr Trump's comments, while other teams allowed their players to protest at their own discretion. In addition to most, if not all, of the NFL teams seeing some players [[Protests|protesting]] the weekend after Mr Trump's September 2017 remarks, baseball professionals and basketball professionals also joined in. Notably, New [[Britain|England]] Patriots quarterback [Tom Brady](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/tom-brady) called Mr Trump's comments "divisive" and locked arms with his teammates during his game following the president's remarks. Brady has remained mostly silent about Mr Trump, whom he has called a friend in the past.

**Why exactly is this such a big deal?**

Mr Trump charges that kneeling during the national anthem is disrespectful to American servicemen and [[women]], as do many of his supporters. The White House has repeatedly attempted to rebrand the protest as a protest of the American flag instead of against police brutality and [[racism]] in [[America|the US]]. After Kaepernick first started the protest, he was criticised for introducing [[politics]] into sports. Many said that football was somehow sacrosanct, and that it should be a place where people can rise above [[politics]].

**But is it abnormal for sports stars to make their political opinions known during events?**

No, not really. There's a pretty rich history of American sports stars wading into the political sphere.  For instance, John Carlos and Tommie Smith made headlines across the world when they raised the [black power salute](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/black-power) on the podium after winning in the 1968 Olympics. That protest brought them death threats, and they were expelled from the games.

[Muhammad Ali](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/muhammadali) is perhaps one of the best known American athletes to take a major political stand. While not a direct stand against [[racism]], Ali refused to be drafted into the [[Vietnam]] [[War]] --- a refusal that involved jail time. He did so on the basis of his [[faith]], he said, but did note the cruel irony of asking black men to fight in [[Vietnam]] for a country that has treated them as subhuman. More recently, NBA players like [LeBron James](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/LeBron_James), Kobe Bryant, and others, helped the [Black Lives Matter](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/black-lives-matter) movement pick up steam by wearing supportive shirts following the death of Eric Garner, who was choked to death in New York.

**What is the new NFL rule?**

NFL owners unanimously approved a national anthem policy in September 2018, requiring players to stand if they are on the field during the performance of the song. Players have the option to remain in the locker room during the anthem if they prefer.

If a player or other employee of a team kneels or sits during the anthem, the teams themselves are fined. The teams then have the option to fine the individual players or personnel for the infraction. The vote was unanimous, but the owner of the San Francisco 49ers --- the team Kaepernick played for when he started the protest --- abstained from the vote. The rule will be added to the NFLs game operations manual, and therefore will not be subject to collective bargaining. The NFL Players Association has said it will review the policy and "challenge any aspect" of the rule that is violates the collective bargaining agreement between players and their employers.

**What has happened to Kaepernick?**

Kaepernick is not currently on any NFL team.

# Ex-Green Beret Nate Boyer writes open letter to Trump, Kaepernick, NFL and America

Zachary Bako for ESPN Oct 13, 2017 **Nate Boyer**

*Editor\'s note: More than a year after penning an open letter to Colin Kaepernick, former Army Green Beret and NFL player Nate Boyer writes another one, this time calling for unity across all sides of [[America|the United States]]. Here\'s his letter, as told to ESPN San Francisco 49ers reporter Nick Wagoner.*

*Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only [[love]] can do that.\" \-- Dr. [[MLK|Martin Luther King]] Jr.*

Dear Every Single American,

Every. Single. American. Including President Trump, Colin Kaepernick, and my brothers in arms overseas who are wondering, \"what in the hell is going on back there?\" I\'m sitting in the same chair, in the same apartment that I sat in almost a year ago when I wrote an open letter to Colin Kaepernick. I was hurt when I saw him sitting on the bench during the national anthem, but I\'m much more hurt now. Not by him, not by where we\'re at now with the [[protests]], but by us.

Simply put, it seems like we just hate each other; and that is far more painful to me than any protest, or demonstration, or rally, or tweet. We\'re told to pick a side, there\'s a line drawn in the sand \"are you with us or against us?\" It\'s just not who we are, or at least who we\'re supposed to be; we\'re supposed to be better than that, we\'re [[America|Americans]]. This doesn\'t even seem to be about right or wrong, but more about right or left.

Today it feels like this national divide isn\'t even really about the anthem, or the flag, or kneeling, or sitting, or fists in the air. It\'s not about President Donald Trump, it\'s not about Colin Kaepernick, it\'s not about the military, or even police brutality. It feels like it\'s about winning. That\'s what makes [[America]] so great, our sheer competitiveness. We\'re winners, and we won\'t quit until victory is ours.

We see it in sports everyday, we \"live and die\" by the outcomes of our teams. That [[desire]] to win at all cost is costing us greatly now among our neighbors. This winning mentality seems to have spilled over into an obsession with being right and not willing to admit that maybe, just maybe we were wrong. We repeat mantras to ourselves like, \"no matter what I will never ever surrender.\"

> ***\"To deploy overseas, train, live with, fight alongside, and ultimately defend foreigners that you have little in common with is truly a challenging task. But returning home to a country that is so divided, so judgmental, and so hateful of one another is almost as difficult to deal with as burying a fallen comrade.\"***

Earlier this week I sat down with a group of five Combat Arms and Special Operations Veterans. The round table discussed our individual feelings on the flag, the anthem, and the players who knelt when it was played. We all had very different takes, but what surprised me most at the end of the discussion was that we all agreed on one thing. Colin Kaepernick and President Trump should be the ones uniting our country together. Wait\...what? I know it sounds crazy, but maybe that\'s exactly what we need to see. Maybe that\'s how we start to heal. Two men sit in a room and talk, simple as that.

That\'s how it all started with Colin and I, neither of us knew that kneeling would be the result of our conversation. Colin wanted to sit, I wanted him to stand, and so we found a common ground on a knee alongside his teammates. I believe that progress and real change happens in this world when you reach across the divide, you build a bridge, you swallow your pride, you open your mind, you embrace what you don\'t understand, and ultimately you surrender.

Now I don\'t pretend to speak for everyone who fought overseas, many veterans rightfully disagree with my position. But I do feel that I echo the sentiments of most [[war]] fighters when I say that what we hope for more than anything right now in [[America]] is unity. To deploy overseas, train, live with, fight alongside, and ultimately defend foreigners that you have little in common with is truly a challenging task. But returning home to a country that is so divided, so judgmental, and so hateful of one another is almost as difficult to deal with as burying a fallen comrade. In fact we\'re still losing our brothers in arms overseas right now and it\'s hardly mentioned it in the [[media]]; but that\'s OK, we don\'t risk our lives and sacrifice so much for fanfare or recognition. It\'s not at all why we do what we do. We do what we do because you are worth it, because we [[love]] you.

I would [[love]] for those two leaders to have that conversation, but more than anything I just want us to [[love]] one another again. One great thing about freedom is that you get to choose everyday how you treat your neighbor. This IS the best country in the world, but we can always do better. I\'m laying it all out there because I have to, I swore to defend this land and its people, and I will die trying. I know some people will hate this (we [[love]] to hate things these days), and I\'ll get called a disgrace to the Green Beret once again. But I don\'t care, [[America|the United States]] means more to me than any of that.

Colin Kaepernick\'s decision to change his protest to kneeling during the national anthem was made with input from several interested parties.

Over the past year I\'ve come across veterans from various walks of life. We may actually be the most diverse sub-culture in the [[America]]. Since I myself am a Green Beret, I want to share with you a couple of messages that were sent to me from men in my former unit. One of them is white, and one of them is black:

> \"Hey brother. At first I was with you on the Kaepernick issue. However, I just stood in formation while one of our brothers was pulled off a plane with our nation\'s flag draped over the coffin. I had to fight back tears as I saw the pain in the eyes of Staff Sergeant T\'s wife and family. While I would like to sit here and tell you that I rose above it all, I have to be honest. My heart filled with rage. Rage for anyone who takes for granted the ideals and symbols that we fight and die for.\"
>
> \"Hey Brother, this is J. I spent nearly 18 years in 10th Special Forces Group and wish I had an opportunity to meet a brother like yourself. I just want to say I appreciate your views on this national anthem and flag issue. I [[love]] our country, but at the same time I have to take the time to tell my sons to act a certain way out of fear for their lives when dealing with police officers. Most of my neighbors and friends here in MD are law enforcement personnel and will tell you they also have to act a certain way to avoid confrontation and situations that normally don\'t occur for those that are not of color. Not all officers are bad, the majority I believe are good and poor training is attributed to some of these issues we hear of. I really just want to thank you for your taking the time out to understand and convincing him to take a knee and not sit out on what we have fought for. God Bless You Bro!\"

Different backgrounds, different experiences, different colors, but at the end of the day they just want the same basic things for their families.

So please, no more lines in the sand, not at home, not among our people. No more choosing sides, no more \"for or against.\" I believe our Veterans will be called upon to lead the way in healing the world and solving its problems; right now our country needs that more than I can remember. So I\'ll be here, standing in the radical middle, doing what I can to continue fighting for those that can\'t fight for themselves. Let\'s get this thing fixed together, you and me. I [[love]] you all with all my heart.

# **A new look at racial disparities in police use of deadly force**

July 31, 2018 6.41am EDT

### 

[**Joseph Cesario**](https://theconversation.com/profiles/joseph-cesario-265012), Associate Professor of Psychology, Michigan State University

### Disclosure statement: Joseph Cesario has received funding from the U.S. National Science Foundation and the Leibniz Institute for Psychology Information (ZPID).

One of the most important social issues of the last five years is fatal police shootings of black [[America|Americans]].

The concern that police fatally shoot blacks at higher rates than whites has given rise to a strong push for department-wide interventions for police officers. Such interventions, usually in the form of ["implicit bias" training](https://trustandjustice.org/resources/intervention/implicit-bias), rely on changing the beliefs that officers have about minorities as a means of reducing this racial disparity. But are the assumptions underlying these interventions reasonable? Is there strong evidence that faulty officer decision-making is responsible for the racial disparity in fatal police shootings?

There is [clear evidence](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/31/the-counted-police-killings-2015-young-black-men) of racial differences in fatal police shootings in terms of population proportions. Black [[America|Americans]] are only about [13 percent of the population](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_15_5YR_DP05&src=pt), but make up over 30 percent of people fatally shot by police.

It is from this evidence that many [news outlets](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-are-so-many-black-[[America|americans]]-killed-by-police/) and [activists](https://blacklivesmatter.com/) conclude that police officers are racially-biased in their decisions to shoot. If this is true, then it makes good sense to target officer bias.

But is comparing the percentages of blacks and whites shot to the percentages of blacks and whites in the population really the right comparison? Does it tell us what we need to know about how to reduce fatal police shootings?

[My colleagues and I](https://www.cesariolab.com/police) have expertise in [decision-making](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ttizi7gAAAAJ&hl=en) and [police use of force](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VzsNt-MAAAAJ&hl=en). We tested whether these population-level comparisons provide us with the information we need to reduce police shootings. Our recent work, [published in Social Psychological and Personality Science](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550618775108?journalCode=sppa), reveals a different view of police bias.

## Importance of benchmarks

Using population-level comparisons as a benchmark for evidence of officer racial bias relies on the assumption that people of all races are equally involved in situations where officers are likely to use deadly force. We argue that this assumption has led to a misdiagnosis of the problem, and by extension, solutions that won't work.

Consider the following example: Imagine that you want to know if there is racial disparity in who receives cancer treatment. You find that among those receiving treatment, blacks make up 13 percent. Comparing this to the overall population of 13 percent, you would conclude that no racial disparity existed.

Yet suppose you learn that blacks make up 75 percent of people with cancer. Surely you would conclude that there is racial disparity in receiving treatment. That's because the relevant pool is those who need treatment, not the general population.

## More likely to be shot, compared to what?

As with the cancer example above, it is crucial to choose the correct benchmark or pool of individuals to compare an outcome with.

In the case of police shootings, [the evidence is clear](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1745-9133.12174) that fatal shootings are strongly tied to situations in which violent crime is being committed or suspected of being committed. A typical fatal police shooting occurs when there is the potential for imminent death to an officer or other citizen. Almost [85 percent](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1745-9133.12269) of police fatal shootings involve armed citizens.

Given this, we can ask, "Are blacks shot more than whites given their presence in situations in which police shootings are likely to occur?"

To answer the question, my colleagues and I [analyzed the largest database of fatal police shootings to date](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550618775108?journalCode=sppa), The Guardian's database of police shootings, [The Counted](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/counted-us-police-killings). It covers all known shootings from 2015 to 2016. We calculated the odds of being shot for blacks and whites given violent crime rates for each group, which we established by using 16 different measures of crime across four databases. We used these different crime rates as a means of estimating presence in deadly force situations.

One might ask, "Isn't using arrest data to assess crime rates wrong, given that police are more likely to police black communities and arrest black citizens?"

If police are more likely to arrest black citizens than white citizens -- without any actual racial differences in criminal behavior -- this would inflate crime estimates for blacks and would skew our findings.

To deal with this, we also looked at a different set of data to measure crime -- [death by assault records](https://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd-icd10.html) from the Centers for [[Disease]] Control. These data are derived from death certificates. Whether police are more likely to arrest one race or another for, say, homicide would have no impact on the CDC's counts for how often members of each race die from assault. Thus, the data provide a way to estimate rates of violent crime that is not biased from police arrest decisions (although it is possible that this data could be subject to other kinds of errors).

When we considered the rates at which people from different groups are likely to be present in these contexts, a different picture emerged.

The differences in involvement in criminal situations between black and white citizens fully explains the population-level disparity in fatal police shootings.

This suggests that officer bias -- in terms of officers making different shooting decisions for black and white citizens -- is not necessarily the cause of black citizens being shot at higher rates. Even if officers were making the same decisions about whether to use deadly force for black and white citizens, population-level disparities would still emerge given these crime rate differences.

What about shootings of unarmed citizens? The results were too uncertain to draw firm conclusions one way or another. This is because the number of fatal shootings in which a citizen is unarmed and not assaulting an officer is small -- about 6 percent of all fatal shootings, or [45 people every year](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550618775108?journalCode=sppa).

To be clear, there is a population-level racial disparity in fatal police shootings. But our work suggests this disparity is explained by differences in rates of exposure to the police, rather than racial bias by officers making deadly force decisions.

## Now what?

These results may help explain why department-wide implicit bias training has not been -- [and will not be](http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-29854-001) -- effective. It is not addressing the root of the problem. The notion that all officers across the profession are biased in this important decision is not supported by the data.

Instead, our research suggests two paths for reducing fatal police shootings and reducing the population-level gap in these shootings.

First, the most effective means of reducing police shootings would be to reduce violent crime, particularly crimes involving firearms. While this may seem obvious, the point has been lost in most public discussions. The decision to shoot usually happens in certain contexts -- reducing the frequency of those events will directly reduce police shootings.

At the same time, it would also reduce police shootings of innocent unarmed citizens who live in neighborhoods with high rates of violent crime. One recent example is the case of [Akai Gurley](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/22/nyregion/housing-patrols-can-mean-safety-or-peril-to-residents.html), an unarmed black man who was killed by police patrolling a public housing building in New York City with high rates of violent crime. Reducing violent crime rates would reduce the expectation that officers have of encountering armed individuals in such locations, likely reducing such mistakes.

Second, researchers need to develop tools that accurately identify those few officers who do show robust evidence of racial bias and identify which psychological processes are responsible for such bias. Officers might treat black and white citizens differently due to implicit bias, explicit [[racism]], or even something much more basic such as low skill at visually distinguishing harmless objects from guns.

Targeted interventions, based on a scientific understanding of bias, are needed -- not blanket, untested interventions based on faulty assumptions. [Our lab](https://www.cesariolab.com/research) has recently been awarded a National Science Foundation grant to develop such interventions.

All research has limitations, and ours is no exception. Our analyses look at national data and cannot speak to any individual case or police officer. Moreover, there is [robust evidence of racial bias](http://www.nber.org/papers/w22399) in other use-of-force behaviors, such as Taser use -- just not the use of deadly force. Anti-bias training might be effective in stemming these racially-biased policing behaviors.

Finally, the question of why crime rates are different across racial groups in the U.S. is a complicated question beyond the scope of this research, and thus we do not speak to this issue. Nonetheless, we believe that any research that can suggest new and innovative interventions to address this important problem should be encouraged.

# Fatal police shootings of unarmed people have 

# significantly declined, experts say

By [**John Sullivan**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/john-sullivan/), [**Julie Tate**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/julie-tate/) and **Jennifer Jenkins** May 7, 2018

The number of deadly police shootings of unarmed people has generally declined since 2015 even as the tally of fatal shootings by law enforcement is on pace to hit nearly 1,000 for the fourth year in a row, according to data gathered by The Washington Post.

Fatal shootings of unarmed black men --- such as the high-profile case in March of [Stephon Clark in Sacramento](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/03/30/stephon-clark-was-shot-eight-times-mostly-in-his-back-according-to-autopsy-requested-by-his-family/) --- are among the kinds of killings that have fallen. Criminologists said the downturn in the number of cases and their analysis of the data indicate that evidence of racial bias by police who shoot and kill unarmed blacks has also declined but not disappeared.

"These trends mark significant changes," said Geoff Alpert, a professor in the department of criminology and criminal justice at the University of South Carolina who has been reviewing and studying the data at The Post's request. "What we don't understand yet is what's causing these numbers to move downward."

In 2015, police shot and killed 94 unarmed individuals, a number that fell to 51 in 2016 before rising to 68 in 2017.

Academics warn against over-interpreting the data relating to a decline of evidence of bias. The numbers are so small, they said, that even a few cases recorded in error could produce a different result.

The Post researchers [began tracking deadly police shootings in 2015](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/police-shootings-2018/?utm_term=.cdd2fdc8f6c3) after the fatal shooting by police of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. Information about shootings is gleaned from news reports and other public sources and compiled in a publicly available database.

The 2014 death of Brown, an unarmed black man, sparked nationwide [[protests]] and scrutiny of the use of deadly force by police. In March, the shooting of Clark reignited the debate. Police shot him in the back yard of his grandmother's home. Clark, a 22-year-old black man, was unarmed and holding a cellphone. The shooting was captured by police body cameras and in helicopter video.

The ongoing Post project has found that police have shot and killed 3,309 people since 2015, or more than twice as many fatal shootings per year as the average reported by the FBI. Of those killed, 231, or 7 percent, were not armed with guns, knives or other objects that could be used as weapons at the time of the shootings, according to the data.

A review of the shootings of unarmed people shows that officers were reported to be under physical attack in about 40 percent of the cases. The remaining 60 percent involved a variety of circumstances, including individuals' making provocative movements or verbal threats (31 percent) or fleeing, or being shot unintentionally or in undetermined circumstances, according to a review of news reports and video of the incidents. The news accounts cited in the Post database are typically summaries based on information provided by police at the time of each event.

In recent years, the fatal shootings of black men have drawn the most scrutiny and generated the greatest outrage --- especially when the men were unarmed or the incidents were captured on video. The videos have provided a visual record of events that otherwise might have been described only by the officers involved. At least 38 of the 231 shootings have been recorded to some extent on police body cameras.

Since The Post began tracking fatal police shootings, blacks have been shot and killed at rates significantly higher than their percentage of the overall U.S. population. Blacks make up about 13 percent of the population but 23 percent of those fatally shot by police since 2015. For shootings of unarmed people, blacks were 36 percent of those killed.

In 2016, Alpert, working with Justin Nix, a criminologist at the University of Nebraska in Omaha, used the Post database and demographic data to examine the racial disparities in unarmed shootings in 2015.

That year, police killed 38 unarmed blacks and 32 unarmed whites. Whites accounted for 49 percent of all 2015 fatal police shootings, while blacks constituted 26 percent. The academic researchers found that blacks who were fatally shot were twice as likely to be unarmed as whites.

Since that finding, the number of shootings of unarmed men and [[women]] has dropped. The number of unarmed whites killed has made up a greater percentage of the total since 2016, when police killed 22 unarmed whites and 19 unarmed blacks. The pattern held in 2017, with 30 whites killed compared with 20 blacks. This year, police have killed 18 unarmed people, with 10 whites and seven blacks among them. Police have also killed 42 unarmed Hispanics over the past three years, or about 18 percent of the 231 killed.

At The Post's request, Alpert and Nix revisited their bias analysis. They said the data from the additional years of shootings had shown that their indicator of racial bias by police in unarmed shootings had declined --- from blacks who were fatally shot in 2015 being twice as likely to be unarmed to only "slightly more likely" when the entire three years of data is considered.

Alpert and other experts called the trends encouraging but cautioned that it is hard to draw conclusions without additional years of data and more detailed and comprehensive information about each shooting and overall police use of force. The experts have long maintained that the FBI should collect better data.

"The national conversation about policing for the last few years has been about race," Nix said. He said agencies have begun implementing bias awareness and de-escalation training. "We haven't had a chance to determine their effectiveness, but it's possible this has all had a cumulative effect on officers."

For their analysis, Nix and Alpert used a proxy for bias: They studied cases where the officer had little provocation to shoot, or the unarmed person presented no clear threat, which they defined as a lack of threatening movements, and they controlled for unintentional shootings, mental illness and other variables.

Other academics also said that the decline in the shootings of unarmed people is important but that any racial analysis is fraught without more data over time. "A clerical error in one department could literally flip the interpretation of it," said Phillip Goff, a social psychologist at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York and co-founder of the Center for Policing Equity. Goff and others say that the numbers of unarmed shootings are so small that any interpretations amount to guesswork. "When you're looking at racial disparities, you're on super-shaky ground," said Goff, who said he hoped the public would not interpret the data to mean bias is no longer present.

Andrew P. Wheeler, a professor at the University of Texas at Dallas who studies police shootings, agreed. "When you only look at the worst outcomes, it's hard to say if this marks a real change or is random chance," he said. Nix acknowledged the data's shortcomings but said it still has value. "We shouldn't ignore the data because it's not perfect," Nix said.

The Post's review of shooting data showed that officers were under physical attack in 88 of 231 shootings. In about half of those cases, The Post found video, eyewitnesses or evidence of injury to police that supported the officers' claims of attack.
