Concepts:

-   Know the three domains of life and their basic characteristics.

-   What was the Miller-Urey Experiment? What did it find?

-   What were the likely characteristics of LUCA? What does LUCA stand for?

-   What are the characteristics of prokaryotic cells?

-   What are Archaea? Where are they found? Know the three examples above and where they live.

-   What are Bacteria? Where are they found?

-   Know and be able to explain the endosymbiont hypothesis. What does it mean? Who came up with the idea? Were plant-like or animal-like cells the first to be formed? Be able to name at least three lines of evidence that supports it.

-   Why are protists considered an artificial assemblage? Why do some people not consider the Kingdom Protista a "true kingdom"?

-   Why do we care about studying protists?

-   Review the supergroups of protists. You will probably have a matching question very similar to the one given in the lecture, matching the supergroups with their synapomorphy (shared, derived character).

-   Which organisms cause red tides? Which cause trichomaniasis? Freshwater ick? Other diseases covered in the lecture? I'll probably make this a matching question between the organism (scientific name) and the [[disease]].

-   Review pseudopodia and how they differ in the different choanoflagellates.

-   Obviously, the questions at the end of the protist lecture are fair game.

Hyphae -- cells of fungi, form mycelium,

Mycelium - mushroom apple, mycelium tree

Coenocytic Hyphae -- don't have crosswalls (not true hyphae) single cell, easily injure

Asci -- sack of spores

Basidia -- hand with fingers of spores

Clamp Connections -- phsidial mycota

Symbionts -- organisms that live together

Saprobes -- breaks down dead things

Lichens -- symbioses between algae and fungi

Alternation of Generations -- switch between haploid and diploid, explain differences between plants and this

Gametophyte -- haploid stage

Sporophyte -- diploid stage

Doctrine of Signatures -- plants often are named after what they heal or do

Frond -- fern, big sporophyte/leaf of fern

Sori -- spores on underside of frond

Fiddlehead -- small/baby frond

Seeds -

Seed Coat -- wait till weather is right to release seeds

Pollen -- male gamete of flower, carried in different ways (wind, pollenators)

Ovule -- female gamete of flower

Pistil -- sigma, style, ovary

Stamen -- male part of flower, filament, anther (pollen sack)

Pollinia -- orchids use these sacks of pollen that attach to wasps

Concepts:

-   What roles do fungi play in the environment? How do they get their nutrients?

    -   Saprobes, symbionts, pathogens

    -   Digest food outside and then bring in the nutrients

-   Why should we care about fungi?

    -   Cooking, brewing, pharmacy, cool,

-   Know the characteristics and diagnostic features of the four major phyla of fungi: Chytridiomycota, Zygomycota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota. Spore production and hyphal characteristics are the major differences.

    -   Chytridiomycota -- rizoids, microscopic, motal spores, amphibian killer

    -   Zygomycota -- hyphae with no cross walls, blasts spores

    -   Ascomycota -- true hyphae, spores in sack, rotisma star spotted maple, ergot (LSD)

    -   Basidiomycota -- mushrooms

-   Know about *Pilobolus* and the Zone of Repugnance.

-   What is the significance of *Chara*?

    -   Relatives where ancestors of land plants, withstands periodic drying out

-   What is the ecological significance of bryophytes? What are mosses used for?

    -   Bandages, scotch

    -   First lands plants, fast growing/spreading

-   Understand how alternation of generation works in bryophytes. Which stage is dominant? What does the sporophyte stage look like?

-   Know the three main groups of bryophytes (Liverworts, Hornworts, and Mosses).

    -   Know these are bryophytes

-   What is the Doctrine of Signatures? Who was the first to use it?

    -   theophrastus

-   How does alternation of generations work for seedless vascular plants? How is it different from bryophytes?

    - 

-   What selective pressures lead to the development of vascular tissue?

    -   Bryophytes have to live in wet place, vascular tissue removes that, lets the live taller

-   What are some ecological roles and economical uses of seedless vascular plants?

    - 

-   How does alternation of generations work for gymnosperms? How does it differ from seedless vascular plants? Bryophytes?

    -   That one slide

-   What does pine pollen look like? Why does it have a "Mickey Mouse Ears" appearance?

    -   Ears are air sacs that keep it boyant

-   How are most gymnosperms pollinated? Are they all pollinated in the same way?

    - 

-   Why are gymnosperms important to humans?

    -   Pine tar, pitch, resin

-   How are angiosperms pollinated?

    -   pollinators

-   Be able to label a diagram of an angiosperm flower.

    -   fuck

-   Know the difference between perfect and imperfect flowers.

    -   Perfect, male and female, imperfect only one

-   What are some different methods of pollination used by angiosperms? What do bee-pollinated flowers look like? Fly-pollinated? Bird-pollinated?

    -   What do flowers look like depending on their pollinator

    -   Bee = yellow, fly = smell like meat
