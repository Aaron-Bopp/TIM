**Design Issues in Software Engineering**

*Rajeev Chapagin and Avishek Khadka*

Designing in software level is divided into two parts, Conceptual Design and Technical Design. Conceptual designs are presented to the customers to make them fully understand about the product whereas, Technical designs are for the software engineers to help build the system. Problems are caused when the two designs do not go parallel with each other and cause a conflict between the customer's request. This problem leads to a bigger problem which is low cohesion. Cohesion means the degree of intradependibility within the elements of a module. In simpler terms, cohesion is when things that belong together are kept together. When there is low cohesion, maintaining and reusing the designs in a software is difficult which makes the software itself difficult to understand. It is generally believed that the greater the cohesion, the better the program design, and the easier it is to understand the software.

The existing solution to these problems is proper cohesion techniques. There are different types of cohesion methods such as Sequential Cohesion, Logical Cohesion, etc. Cohesion helps the project to look organized and, in a sequence, which helps the engineers and even the costumers understand the designing of the software.

The proposed solution to this problem is a proper communication method between the costumer and the engineers. The engineers should have direct access to what the expectations of the customers are, and the customers should be guided on the things the software engineers will be working on. There should be a process where both the engineers and costumers are made aware of their expectations of the product. This could include meetings in a regular manner or a survey system about the need and expectation of the product that is being engineered.

This was one of the design issues we found in Software Engineering. This is a serious problem but can be solved easily with the help of proper communication and techniques to make cohesion better.
