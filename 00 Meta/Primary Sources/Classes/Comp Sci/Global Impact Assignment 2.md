**Foundations of Computing - [[Global Impact Assignment]]**

**Objective:** Give you the opportunity to research and reflect upon the impact of computing on society.

Global Impact is the last and arguably most important of the 7 Big Ideas of [[Computer]] Science. In this assignment, you will identify and summarize **2** news articles that describe how computing has had an impact on society. One of the news articles should be mainly positive, the other mainly negative.

The news articles should not be about the technology per se (e.g., a faster microprocessor, or some cool gizmo), but the *impact* that computing has had on people, on society. For example, a news article on how Google Translate is facilitating tourism, or how [[machine learning]] is making it possible to detect cancers earlier, would be fine; but an article reviewing the latest iPhone would not.

The articles should be from reliable news sources, no more than **6** months old. A good way to start is by skimming through the front (web)pages of popular [[media]] outlets, e.g., New York Times, WSJ, NPR, Toronto Globe and Mail, Wired, The Economist, BBC, Medium, etc.

**Submission:**\
A word or text document with the following information for **each** of the two articles (one positive impact, one negative impact):

\* a url

\* a short paragraph (250 words, max) summarizing the article

â€¢ an even shorter paragraph (100 words, max) indicating your response to the article.

Eight months ago an Uber [[self]] driving car struck and kill a pedestrian. Uber is close to putting [[self]]-driving cars back on the road in a very limited amount. Previously their cars were in four different cities and would drive in most conditions, now they will only drive between two offices in good weather. They also used to exceed 55 mph but now they will not exceed 25 mph. Even with all these setbacks they are still facing considerable issues. These cars are slower to react that human drivers and are struggling to pass track validation tests. This scaled down testing is a big hit for Uber, they lost 1 billion in their most recent quarter. This is opposite of what the [[self]] driving cars are supposed to be doing, saving the company money. Apparently when testing Uber [[self]]-driving cars were seen to run red lights, and other erratic behaviors. Just a few weeks ago Uber's [[self]] driving division was experiencing issues with track testing failures. In order to match human reaction speeds the cars need to drive 30% slower than a human driver. Some engineers at Uber are worried that Uber is taking shortcuts to get their cars on the roads. While Uber has been failing to make headway other companies are forging ahead. Google, Lyft, and General Motors have all been working their own [[self]] driving solutions. The [[government]]'s guidelines for this kind of stuff is very unfinished. It is the wild west of car manufacturing and driving.

My response to this article is as follows. I do not think that [[self]]-driving technology is to the point where [[self]]-driving cars can can be on the road with human drivers. It would be interesting to see what accidents with [[self]]-driving cars happen because of of other drivers. Obviously this one didn't involve any other vehicles, but some may think that this may not be fully on the [[self]]-driving car. Some of the the blame is on the safety driver who was not paying attention. Uber knows that their cars aren't totally ready and she did not do her job.

SolarCity is now the largest solar power company in the nation. They have been the leading company in consumer solar panels for a while. A new company called Sunrun is now encroaching on their [[business]]. They are set to emerge as the top residential solar installer in [[America|the US]] according to the senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie (consulting firm on renewable energy). Wood Mackenzie tracks and supplies solar data for the Solar Energy Industries Association. they say Tesla/SolarCity accounts for 9.3 percent of residential solar installations nationwide this year followed by Sunrun at 9 percent. Tesla also has a large stake in resedential battery manufacturing. They produce multiple different kinds of batteries for different purposes. Sunrun's focus has been primarily on installing sun roofs not manufacturing them. California recently implemented a policy that new homes must include solar power by 2020 and the Governor signed a bill that allocated 800 million to providing rebates for home energy-storage systems. Tesla has recently switched from selling their solar panels in Home Depot's to selling them under one roof. While this may save money for Tesla it helps there opponent Sunrun who sells their solar panels out of CostCo. The increase in costs from power providers has increased people's reliance on solar power. Tesla has doubled down on its approach of trying to innovate and enter sectors that aren't as developed. Because of this they are falling behind Sunrun in the installation of solar panels [[business]], but they're okay with that. The end

I think that solar energy is the greatest hope we have for renewable energy in the near future. Installing solar panels on your roof, especially in a place like California, is a great investment so that your bills are lower, and your property value is higher. I'm not sure if solar energy is to the place where it should be mandated in every new house by 2020, but a lot can change in two years. I also think that Tesla will likely bring about the innovation that will change the worlds look on solar energy. They are doing too much with solar and batteries not to.
