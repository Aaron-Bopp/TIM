Abstract

Cloud Computing has exponentially grown in Software Engineering in the past few years giving access to expensive resources remotely to engineers whom otherwise might not be able to afford or access such services. In the past, innovators wanting to progress the world of [[Computer]] Science would have to flock universities that could afford "super computers" in order to test complex programs, calculations, and to sort large amounts of data. Now with companies like Amazon offering Amazon Web Services(AWS), innovators whom would have never before been able to access or afford such computational resources, can now rent them out from anywhere with an [[internet]] connection. Along with the vast improvement of resources cloud computing can give the user, it comes at a cost. The speed and amount of data that gets processed in 2020 vs. ten years ago has so much exponential growth that companies are pumping out as many cloud computing servers as they can. To meet demand, companies have essentially been forced to do this for a period long enough for us to notice change is needed. Cloud computing servers are now taking the initiative to go green in making their servers use clean energy and use primarily recyclable parts. The new trend of Green Cloud Computing will further allow for computations to get cheaper in the long run, have less environmental impact, and greater ability for people to access these resources.
