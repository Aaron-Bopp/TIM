> During the coming summer, Maryville Sports League (MSL) is planning to organize a tournament among groups of youth sharing common sport activities, but who have never met each other in person. For example, soccer, basketball, athletes (running), and baseball. Players can register online for at most two-specific category of these sports, say soccer and baseball.
>
> Teams compete against each other for two weeks; and the 4 best teams, from each sport category, will play the semifinal and final games after 2 weeks of competition.
>
> The objectives of the MSL project are specified as follows:

-   Provide a software [[infrastructure]] to design this project, including

    -   Registration of new players and keep track of their profiles and contact information.

    -   Registration of new games.

    -   Organizing the tournament.

    -   Customize the number and sequences of games for each sport category (knock-out).

    -   Keep track of the team/individual scores.

    -   Provide an [[infrastructure]] for advertisers.

    -   Keep track of tournament statistics.

-   Users of the system

    -   Players should be able to register, play the opponent team that is assigned to, or drop out of the tournament.

    -   The advertisers should be able to select, upload new advertisements, and cancel advertisements.

    -   Spectators should be able to check scores and statistics of past games. Spectators do not need to register.

    -   For each category of sports, the supervisor should organize and announce new tournament games.

    -   The system must support the kick-off of many parallel tournaments.

> There are more architectural styles than we covered in the lectures. However, the ones covered in class are the predominants. For each system described below, which architectural style, if there exists one/ones, is (are) the most appropriate for the given system. If any of the following problems do not match any architectural styles (or a combination) we covered in class, then state it in your answer with a very brief explanation.
