**Week 04 Homework**

Review Questions:

R23: The overlay network is a P2P file sharing system. There is an edge if two computers/nodes are connected over a TCP connection. It does not include routers.

R25: file distribution, instant messaging, video streaming, music streaming

R26: With UDP there is no welcoming socket and everything enters through one socket. With TCP a new socket is created for each new connection. You need n+1 sockets to service n connections.\
R27: The TCP application attempts a connection as so as it starts, the UDP does not.
