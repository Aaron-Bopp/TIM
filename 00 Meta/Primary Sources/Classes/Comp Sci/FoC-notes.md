# History of Computing (Not on Test)

-   Abacus -- first addition machine

-   Pascaline -- first calculator, bronze colored

-   Babbage -- automated the creation of mathematical tables.

    -   Designed an analytical machine that was never built but somebody did make a program for it.

-   Electro-mechanical computers --

    -   1940: George Stibitz, @ Bell Labs, made a **complex number calculator**

        -   Had input and output

    -   Mark 1 -- could do more complex calculations

        -   Used on Manhattan project

        -   Coined the term debugging (removed a moth from the relays)

        -   Grace Hopper created COLBOL and Fortran on this [[computer]]

-   Electronic computers -- ENIAC, IBM

    -   Based on vacuum tubes (created lots of heat and often burnt out) (18000)

    -   Used cables to create programs (cut calculation to time from 12 hours to 30 seconds)

    -   Sold 46 for 1,000,000 each

    -   IBM mainframe computers ( about the size of a large printer)

-   Personal Computers

    -   Apple II led the race followed by IBM

    -   Because IBM had name recognition it was accepted by [[business]].

    -   Macintosh was the first GUI based [[computer]]

# Big Ideas of Comp Sci (Quiz 9/7/18)

-   The 7 Big Ideas -- CadaPig (Provides a useful framework for discussing many topics

    -   **Creativity** (coding requires creativity, you often work in groups) ex creating solutions that solve problems

    -   **Abstraction** (taking away a level of detail so it is easier to understand) ex hides the intricacies of what's happening so that a normal person can do something

    -   **Data and Information** (Information is specific/what we understand, data is general/raw)

    -   **Algorithms** (precise, systematic, step-by-step instructions for solving a problem) (flow charts are visual algorithms)

    -   **Programming** (the art of translating an algorithm in a [[computer]] language)

    -   **[[Internet]]** (Individual networks connecting through a unified language) allows us to communicate

    -   **Global Impact** (Computing effects every aspect of society) ex satellites,

# Heuristics and Problem Solving

-   Heuristics

    -   not every problem has an exact solution

    -   you have approximate solutions to unsolvable problems

-   Problem Solving in everyday life

    -   Identify the problem

    -   understand the problem

    -   identify alternative ways to solve problem

    -   select best alternative

    -   evaluate solution

-   Ways to solve problems

    -   Breakdown big problems into smaller problems

    -   look to see if other people have had this problem

    -   Keep trying different solutions

    -   Think about it until you find the right solution

-   Differences between heuristic solutions and algorithmic solutions

    -   Heuristic is approximate but often faster

    -   Algorithmic is exact but sometimes slower

# Power of Programming

-   What can computers do (well)?

    -   Manipulate data

        -   read in data

        -   display data

        -   perform mathematical operations

        -   compare data

        -   move data from place to place

    -   Follow instructions

-   Programming Terminology

    -   Algorithm -- a set of steps that define how a task is performed

    -   program -- take an algorithm and translate it

    -   programming language -- language that we can read that allows us to interact with the [[computer]]

-   Our goal -- a fuller understanding of the magic that underlies computers, how they manage to cram everything in

-   Early computers used all ten numbers but they switched to just two because its easier

# ASCII

-   seperation

    -   bit -- 0 or 1 (abbreviation of binary digit)

    -   byte = 8 bits

    -   nyb ble = 4 bits = half byte

    -   kilo = a thousand bytes

    -   mega= 1 million bytes

    -   giga = a billion bytes

    -   tera = a trillion bytes

-   The process of converting written code to numbers is called digitizing

-   Converting the binary to written info is called encoding

-   ASCII -- American standard code for information interchange

-   Unicode - has 128000 characters and includes ASCII

-   pixel -- is short for picture element

Translating

-   High level language to compiler to assembly language to assembler vto machine language

# The Internet

1.  who -- 1,2,3

2.  of - 1,2

3.  the, doctor, said -- 3,1,2

4.  the doctor said- 3

5.  doctor near who -- 1

6.  who in title -- 1

> (titlestart) Lurker (titleend) Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men. The doctor knows
