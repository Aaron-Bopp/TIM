Totsi Essay

In order to understand a post-apartheid South Africa you must understand the horrors of apartheid. Apartheid is a form of [[government]] mandated [[racism]] that only has its match in [[Nazi]] [[Germany]]. It was the systematic separation of races by the ruling white minority who hoped to create economic and social disparity to increase the power of their rule. The [[segregation]] of South Africa makes Jim Crow laws pale in comparison, and the victory over it is a social movement greater than any other. South Africa is an enigma in Africa and in the world.

As other nations were having their social movements to end [[racism]], South Africa's was just beginning. In 1959 they passed the Promotion of Bantu [[Self]]-[[government]] Act which designated land for different people groups to live based on skin color, with the white minority getting the largest swath. This was supposedly a move to allow the black population to govern themselves, but was really just an excuse to legal [[racism]]. For years the black population fought for economic equality, resulting in the most harrying social fight in history. This movement's figure head, Nelson Mandela, has become one of the most famous people in world history, and his fight culminated in him being elected the first black president of South Africa.

It is interesting to go back and read literature before [[Self]]-[[government]] Act. In an article titled "Race Relations in South Africa As an International Problem" written in 1958 we get a glimpse of the white-black relations. While the author, H.V. Roberts, clearly states, "The Africans, although dominant in number, are the most backward as far as the attributes of Western civilization are concerned," he also says that, "The Coloured people have had a very close and intimate association with the European people over a couple of centuries, but recent legislation which has removed them from the electoral roll of the Europeans has tended to isolate them as a group." This rhetoric is very interesting as he claims that the native Africans have an intimate relationship with the Europeans (white settlers) and later in the article condemns the separating the skin color by borders, saying that it is not feasible economically. Little did he know that the very next year the [[government]] would implement that very thing and that the relationship between the Africans and the Europeans would only get worse (Roberts 1958).

What followed was the worst era of [[segregation]] in South Africa's history. Until 1994 there was massive divide between the white and black communities, sponsored by the [[government]]. Many black protesters lost their lives or were imprisoned, but when apartheid was finally repealed the fight was not over. Relations were still strained and the South Africa's [[economy]] was massively underdeveloped. Over the next twenty years South Africa would have to take on the delicate balancing act of globalizing, implementing social change, and growing their [[economy]]. In 2009 the American Economic Association conducted a study of their progress and concluded that their effort was stable but slow (Coulibaly & Logan. 2009). However, this analysis did not take into account the global financial crisis of 2008, which stopped the economic growth of South Africa in its tracks. As Ayabonga Cawe said in a New York Times article, "We never dismantled apartheid. The patterns of enrichment and impoverishment are still the same." (Goodman, 2017) This is the world that we see in Totsi. A world where apartheid is gone, but its legacy still echoes through the landscape.

Today, South Africa is a country still wrought with economic disparity and political corruption. The president, Jacob Zuma, recently resigned from office because of the mountain of allegations against him. South African millionaire, Marcus Moloeli, by all accounts a [[self]]-made man, rising from a home without electricity all the way to a gated community, says that you must know a politician in order for your [[business]] to succeed. Indeed most South Africans have little to no means to start a [[business]] as the homes they live on are often owned by the [[government]] and thus they have no collateral to get loans from the bank (Goodman 2017). According to a 2016 study, 10 percent of South Africans hold 90% of the wealth, and 80% hold hardy anything. South Africa has own of the highest inequality indexes in the world (Orthofer, 2016).

We see this disparity in *Totsi.* Totsi himself grew up in the lowest form of [[poverty]], but just a few miles away there were gated communities with security systems and automatic gates. We also see the educational disparity, with most of the cast of *Totsi* having limited vocabularies and math skills. *Totsi* does an amazing job of startling the audience with stark images and hopefully helps make people aware of the plight of South Africa. It may be possible to reverse the economic disparity of South Africa, but it will take a lot of hard work and strategy to do it.
