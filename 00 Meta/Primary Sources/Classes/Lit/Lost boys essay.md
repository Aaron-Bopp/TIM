God Grew Tired of Us Essay

The plight of refugees is one that can be seen across the globe. Displaced from their homes, countries, and families, there are more refugees now than almost ever before. These people are fleeing by the millions, trying to find a new life in the EU and US. This journey is harrying and some people even lose their lives along the way. We saw this in the journey of the Lost Boys from Sudan to Ethiopia to Kenya. Thousands of boys set out, but less than half made it all the way. This is just one of the earliest refugee stories. In 2015 almost 2,000 people died crossing the Mediterranean Sea (Beste, 2015). But even when they make it to their host country the welcome isn't so warm.

Because of the massive rise in the number refugees in the past ten years, the word refugee has gained a negative connotation. These people are seen as un-educated, hard to communicate with people, who have little value other than the lowest level of work. Most countries in the EU give refugees the right to work, but even if the refugee had a skilled job in their past country it is unlikely that they will be able to work in that field in their new country. Highly educated workers such as lawyers and doctors will often be unable to find work in their field, resorting to minimum wage work to get by. However, this does not have to be the case. In 2008 the [[Britain|UK]] set up a program where refugee doctors could demonstrate their knowledge and skills. This resulted in over 1000 refugees being registered as doctors (Beste, 2015). Many countries in the [[Europe]] are welcoming refugees with open arms, and are setting apart more and more money to create programs to help these people. Unfortunately, this is not the case in [[America|the US]].

Up until 2017 [[America|the US]] had been on the forefront for helping refugees, but this has been reversed in the Trump administration. In one of their budget proposals they cut nearly 30% of humanitarian aid, but that was thankfully rejected by [[Congress]]. However, they have massively cut the amount of refugees allowed into the country. (Refugees International, 2019) On February 26, 2019 Eric Schwartz, president of Refugees International, spoke before [[congress]] and called for them to resist the Trump Administrations attempts to gut the humanitarian efforts of [[America|the US]]. In is hard to know what [[Congress]] will be able to accomplish, but there is little hope for the any change before 2020.
