- [[Gender has historically been non-binary]] [^1]




[^1]: For as long as human civilization has existed, [there have been people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_history) whose experience of their internal [[gender]] does not align with the physical features of their body. The Gala, a middle [[gender]] priest class of the Sumerian empire, existed over 4,500 years ago. The [[Indigenous]] cultures of North [[America]] recognized [a third gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_gender) far before European colonialism, and still do to this day. Roman emperor Elagabalus (218 AD) insisted on being referred to as Lady rather than Lord, and even put forward a ransom for anyone who could conduct genital [[reconstruction]] surgery.

For as long as human civilization has existed, [there have been people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_history) whose experience of their internal [[gender]] does not align with the physical features of their body. The Gala, a middle [[gender]] priest class of the Sumerian empire, existed over 4,500 years ago. The [[Indigenous]] cultures of North [[America]] recognized [a third gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_gender) far before European colonialism, and still do to this day. Roman emperor Elagabalus (218 AD) insisted on being referred to as Lady rather than Lord, and even put forward a ransom for anyone who could conduct genital [[reconstruction]] surgery. ^22272c

In spite of this, however,  the modern understanding of the [[transgender]] experience ==has only existed for approximately 130 years==. Even the word “[[transgender]]” only dates back to 1965, when John Oliven proposed it as a more accurate alternative to David Cauldwell’s term “transsexual” (coined in 1949), which itself replaced Magnus Hirschfield’s term “transvestite” (1910).

- [[Def]] To be [[transgender]] is to have a [[gender]] [[self]] which does not match the [[gender]] you were presumed to have based on the genitalia you were born with. 
	- This can mean a person born with a penis is actually a girl, that a person born with a vulva is actually a boy, or that a person with either genital configuration may not wholly fit either side of that spectrum and is [[non-binary]].

[[You can discover your transness at any point in life]]==A [[transition]] person can come to recognize this at _any point_ in their life.== [[No]] ==Some children identify it at as soon as they are able to grasp the concept of the differences between the sexes, others don’t start to feel anything until the onset of puberty==, and [[Yes]] ==still others do not realize that anything is wrong at all until they are fully adults==. Many people are simply never exposed to the idea that their [[gender]] could mismatch their birth sex, or what that feels like, and thus simply accepted their fate.

[[Any experience of gender dysphoria is acceptable]] Even more common is a [[perception]] that even though they have feelings about being unhappy with the [[gender]] they were assigned at birth, they believe that this is not the same as what [[transgender]] people experience. Some may feel that a wish to be [[transgender]] and have [[transgender]] available is some kind of disrespect towards “real” [[transgender|trans]] people who knew they were actually boys or girls “born in the wrong body.” ==These narratives of the [[transgender]] experience that have been spread by popular [[media]] create a **very false impression** of just what it means to be [[transition]] and what growing up [[transgender]] feels like.==

[[Gender Dysphoria is based in a intrinsic wrongness of self]] ==This experience of discontinuity between the internal and external [[self]] is what we describe as [[gender dysphoria]]==. Every [[transgender|trans]] person, regardless of their position within or outside of the [[gender]] binary, experiences some form of [[Gender Dysphoria]]. This is something of a political topic within [[transgender|trans]] communities, as different groups have their own ideas of what [[Gender Dysphoria]] is, how it manifests itself, and what qualifies a person as being [[transgender|trans]]. By and large, however, this debate is feckless and fruitless, as the definition at the top of this page encompasses the beginning and the ending of how these terms intermingle.

The [[purpose]] of this site is to document the many ways that [[gender dysphoria]] can manifest, as well as other aspects of [[gender]] [[transgender]], in order to provide a guide for those who are questioning, those who are starting their [[transgender]] journey, those already on their path, and those who simply wish to be better allies.
