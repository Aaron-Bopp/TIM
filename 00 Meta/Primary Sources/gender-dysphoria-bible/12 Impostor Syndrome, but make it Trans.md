==But also, I've seen "angst over not being dysphoric enough" described as a sort of meta-dysphoria? Because it's distress you experience when you're worried you aren't \_\_\_\_\_ enough to be your [[gender]].==

> [[Def]] [Impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) (also known as impostor phenomenon, impostorism, fraud syndrome or the impostor experience) is a psychological pattern in which an individual doubts their accomplishments and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a “fraud”.

Society in general is very good about making [[transgender|trans]] people doubt themselves. We receive tons and tons of subliminal messages through out our lives saying that being [[transgender|trans]] isn’t normal and that anyone who is has to be exceptionally special. Cis [[media]]’s obsession with the “born in the wrong body” narrative has led to a lot of false information being internalized by [[transgender|trans]] youth. ==Many, _many_ [[transgender|trans]] kids grow up thinking they aren’t actually [[transgender|trans]] because they don’t _know_ that they are a different [[gender]], they just wish they were.== Many [[non-binary]] children grow up knowing something is wrong, but not believing they’re [[transgender|trans]] because they don’t feel like a binary [[transgender|trans]] person.

On top of this, messages saying that [[transgender|trans]] people hate their bodies or hate their genitalia have polluted the awareness landscape, so that many people who either do not experience physical dysphoria (or simply think theirs isn’t very strong) go around believing they aren’t “[[transgender|trans]] enough”.

[Gay people 2 decades ago: \*exist\*
](https://twitter.com/RoseOfWindsong/status/1221970265862811650)

Bigots: "They're trying to turn our children [[Queer|gay]]! We must protect our children!"

[[transgender|Trans]] people now: \*exist\*

Bigots: "They're trying to convince our [[Queer|gay]] kids they're the wrong [[gender]]! We must protect our [[Queer|gay]] children!"

On top of this, the constant messaging from transphobic [[media]] that [[transgender|trans]] people are not actually their true genders and are simply trying to trick people into believing otherwise gets internalized like a virus. This creates a lot of [[self]] doubt about the authenticity of one’s [[gender]], especially in the face of so many [[gender]] stereotypes. Seeing oneself fail to meet those stereotypes can make it very easy to convince yourself that you do not live up to your own [[gender]] (note: cis men and [[women]] get this too, far too often).

Furthermore, due to a history of transphobic abuse, many [[transgender|trans]] people suffer from damaged [[self]]-esteems, and often already have difficulty with [[self]] doubts. [[gender dysphoria]] also causes [[depression]], which further contributes to and reinforces those doubts. This all leads into a massive cluster of [[self]] invalidation that can lead someone to struggle over and over again to accept their own [[gender identity]].

==But here’s the thing… only [[transgender|trans]] people are worried about if they are actually [[transgender]]!== A cisgender person does not have this obsession with their [[self]], they think about it, they process it, they move on. If you keep returning to these thoughts over and over again, this is your brain telling you that you took a wrong turn.

The world is _full_ of influences put in place to fill us with doubt and keep us from breaking outside of the established social order. These are some of the systems and ideologies that seek to invalidate [[transgender|trans]] people and keep us from [[self]]-actualizing.

### Autogynephilia 

[Im gonna be blunt: Your [[gender]] is not invalid because you get an erection when seeing yourself dressed as feminine. We’ve all gotten it. It doesn’t mean you’re fetishizing. It doesn’t mean you’re not actually [[transgender|trans]].
](https://twitter.com/TwippingVanilla/status/1153300366902960128)

All it means is that you feel good about how you look.

[Gender Euphoria is sexy. Being comfortable in your clothes is sexy. Liking the way you look is sexy. \*Feeling sexy is sexy!!\*
](https://twitter.com/TwippingVanilla/status/1153300368974991361)

That triggers a turn on, the body reacts to sexy things.

Here’s the kicker: Cis [[Women]] get this too!!! It’s literally just a lady boner!

[But that special outfit that makes you feel really hot? That new dress that you try on for the first time and feel really cute in? That lingerie that you bought specifically to feel sexy in?
](https://twitter.com/TwippingVanilla/status/1153300372468801536)

Yes, that triggers it. All it means is thst you’re happy.

[Let me tell you, the massive relief my friend displayed at learning that this was completely normal was palpable. The poor girl had been stressing about that so hard.

She didn’t even know about AGP, but she knew the stigmas and was terrified that this meant she was fake.

This pattern was strongly reinforced during the late 1980s when the Autogynephelia (AGP) theory of Ray Blanchard gained a lot of traction as [[transgender|trans]] awareness was just starting to escalate. AGP is a pseudo-scientific explanation intended to “explain” the source of [[transgender|trans]] [[women]]’s identities using [paraphilias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphilia). Blanchard separated [[transgender|trans]] [[women]] according to if they were attracted to men or to [[women]], while simultaneously invalidating their womanhood. His work completely ignored [[transgender]] men, and he dismisses [[non-binary]] identities outright.

Autogynephelia attests that straight [[transgender|trans]] [[women]] are actually just [[Queer|gay]] men who seek a feminine appearance to draw [[desire]] from straight men, and that [[transgender|trans]] lesbians are actually straight men who have become so obsessed with their [[desire]] for [[women]] that they wish to become a woman in order to gain sexual gratification from themselves.

Blanchard’s theory largely hinged on the way that presenting feminine often resulted in sexual arousal within newly transitioning [[women]]. You see, most of his study subjects were patients who were trying to seek hormone therapy for the first time, and as such were still very new to presenting female.

Yes, it boggles the mind, but this was actually considered a valid theory of psychology for years. It even appeared in college textbooks. Blanchard’s research studies did not meet scientific rigor, and his data was found to be extremely flawed (he manipulated his patients, and simply just threw out any data that didn’t fit his hypothesis). A lot of his theories are based in misogynistic views of womanhood, and the man never actually involved any cisgender [[women]] in his study to function as a control group. You can read more about how flawed the theory is in Julia Serano’s excellent essay [The Case Against Autogynephilia](https://www.juliaserano.com/av/Serano-CaseAgainstAutogynephilia.pdf).

AGP had been thoroughly dismissed by modern psychology by the late 2000s, but the damage has been done. In the public’s eye, [[transgender|trans]] [[women]] were all perverted fetishists. [[Media]] portrayals of [[transgender|trans]] [[women]] mirrored this attitude, further spreading negative imagery into the public [[conscious|consciousness]].

Transfeminine individuals then internalize these messages, and come to the conclusion that they are not actually [[transgender]], just fetishists. It happened to me, it’s happened to nearly every millennial [[transgender|trans]] woman I know who figured themselves out as a teen.

==You are not a fetishist, the feeling you get from thinking of yourself as a woman is [[Gender Euphoria]].==

### Patriarchal Oppression 
A common source of invalidation for AFABs is the conflation of [[gender]] with the systemic oppression of [[women]], particularly among non-medically-transitioning [[non-binary]] people. The message of “oh you just don’t want to be a woman because of how [[women]] are treated” is far too often heard, and it can deeply infest your [[subconscious]] to the point of [[self]] doubt. But this doesn’t make much sense, because if you’re AFAB and not a woman, that makes you [[transgender]]. And on average, society treats [[transgender]] folks worse than [[women]]. So transitioning to escape systemic oppression is a dumb concept (and I personally have never met a [[transgender|trans]] person who has done this).

Radical Feminism’s messaging of abandoning female [[gender]] roles can also make parsing your own feelings harder. “Am I actually [[non-binary]], or am I just a feminist?” “Am I actually a man, or am I just a very butch [[Queer|lesbian]]?”. For this, I encourage you to talk to cis woman feminists, especially lesbians. They’ll complain about systems of oppression and the patriarchy, but the problems are all external, and they _want to be women_. Even very butch lesbians want to be [[women]], just in a different way from mainstream femininity.

Then you have the problem of people believing that to be [[non-binary]] is to be androgynous, and to be androgynous is to be less feminine. Feminine enbies are valid! It is okay if you do not want to remove your breasts. It is okay if you enjoy your curves. It is okay if you do not mind being called “she” and “her”. That does not make you any less [[transgender]].

If you feel like you are not a binary woman, than you are not a binary woman. Cis [[women]] do not experience that detachment.

### Toxic Masculinity 
Male-assigned kids grow up positively drenched in messaging of what it is to “be a man”. There are so few examples of positive masculinity in popular [[media]], and AMAB Masculine Enbies are also so commonly erased in [[transgender|trans]] representation that being a genderqueer male can feel very lonely. [[Yes]] ==AMAB Enbies are often either grouped in with [[Queer|gay]] cis men or treated like [[transgender|trans]] [[women]].==

You can just be genderqueer! Your [[self]] is valid!

### Transmedicalism 
This one hits _everybody_. Transmedicalism (aka Truetrans) is a [[transgender]] ideology derived from the Harry Benjamin scale (ranks 5 and 6). It seeks to reinforce the pre-WPATH rules, requiring intense physical dysphoria, demanding medical transition, and often invalidating all [[non-binary]] identities. At its core, transmedicalism is a supremacist concept, elevating binary [[transgender|trans]] people above the needs of any other [[gender identity]], and a push back against the expansion of the [[transgender]] [[self]]. They wish for more gatekeeping than we have today, rail against enbies using the [[transgender]] label, and would prefer to see fewer people receive treatment for their [[gender dysphoria]].

To put it succinctly, many transmedicalists hate that the newer generation “has it so easy,” despite the fact that many of their ranks are part of that generation. This ideology started among disgruntled [[transgender|trans]] elders, but has since spread to other binary individuals, particularly among young [[transgender|trans]] men.

If a [[transgender|trans]] person’s first exposure to transness is a transmedicalist, this can severely set back their own [[self]]-acceptance and push them even further into the closet. Transmeds are well known to actually tell people “No, you are not [[transgender|trans]].”

**Do not believe these lies.** They are bully tactics explicitly designed to gaslight and dismiss people’s pain for [[self]] gratification.

### Trans-Exclusionary Reactionary Feminism / Gender Critical Movement / Gender Essentialism 
[Gender Essentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_essentialism) is the belief that there are an innate attributes to a person’s existence that are derived based on what sex organs the person is born with. TERF and GC ideology was born out of the [[Queer|lesbian]] separatist movement of second wave feminism and fully denies the existence of [[transgender]] biology and [[non-binary]] identities. The movement has been largely overtaken by right-wing reactionaries, racists, and homophobes, and is now being bolstered by evangelical [[Christianity|Christian]] organizations.

These people will stop at nothing to invalidate your existence. Do not give them the time of day.

### Gender Abolitionism / Postgenderism 
[Postgenderism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgenderism) is a [transhumanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism) [[philosophy]] originating in radical feminism which states that [[gender]] causes more harm than good, and seeks to eradicate it from our society. GAs believe that all [[gender]] is a construct and that anyone who feels strongly connected to a binary [[gender]] is either nefariously propagating [[gender]] stereotypes or ignorantly following systemic [[indoctrination]].

GAs do not believe in the existence of [[gender dysphoria]], and will attempt to invalidate those who experience it. They’re functionally the extreme leftist version of the [[Gender]] Critical movement.
