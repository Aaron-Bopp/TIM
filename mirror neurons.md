#### <s class="topic-title">[[mirror neurons]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [mirror neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror%20neuron)
> 
> A mirror neuron is a neuron that fires both when an animal acts and when the animal observes the same action performed by another. 
> 
> Thus, the neuron "mirrors" the behavior of the other, as though the observer were itself acting. Such neurons have been directly observed in human and primate species, and in birds.
