#### [[Culture is built off of shared belief in an imagined reality]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Imagined reality is explored in [[books_Sapiens|Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari]], as a mechanism by which humans can have greater cooperation at greater scales than any other species.
This is a large part of [[Greater cooperation and communication has lead to the success of humans as a species]] but it is also the fundamental mechanism behind [[Belief pulls you forward into life]].

This is heavily interwoven with [[religion]], as [[religion]] is often the [[language]] through which we understand this imagined reality.
However, [[Strong enough logic becomes belief]] and thus
[[science]] has started to become as strong of a source of [[faith]] as [[religion]].
