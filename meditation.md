##### Discussion

> [!wikipedia]
> 
> Meditation is practiced in numerous religious traditions. The earliest records of meditation ([[dhyana]]) are found in the [[Upanishads]] of [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[philosophy]], and meditation plays a salient role in the contemplative repertoire of [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]]. Since the 19th century, [[Asian]] meditative techniques have spread to other cultures where they have also found application in non-spiritual contexts, such as business and health.

Research is ongoing to better understand the effects of meditation on health (psychological, neurological, and cardiovascular) and other areas.
