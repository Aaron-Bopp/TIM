#### <s class="topic-title">[[White supremacy]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [White supremacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White%20supremacy)
> 
> White supremacy or white supremacism is the belief that white people are superior to those of other races and thus should dominate them. The belief favors the maintenance and defense of any power and privilege held by white people. White supremacy has roots in the now-discredited doctrine of scientific racism and was a key justification for European colonialism. It underlies a spectrum of contemporary movements including neo-Confederates, neo-Nazism and the so-called Christian Identity movement.
> 
> In academic usage, particularly in [[critical race theory]] or [[intersectionality]], "white supremacy" can also refer to a social system in which white people enjoy structural advantages (privilege) over other ethnic groups, on both a collective and individual level, despite formal legal equality.
