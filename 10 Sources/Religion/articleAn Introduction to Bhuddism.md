> "to be born human is to Buddhists a precious chance at spiritual bliss, a rarity that one should not forsake." [^5]
#### truths
- Four noble truths[^1]
	- Truth of [[suffering]] ^9cb12f
		- [[suffering]] exists; it has a cause; it has an end; and it has a cause to bring about its end
	- Truth of the cause of [[suffering]] ^661817
		- [[desire]] and [[ignorance]] lie at the center of of [[suffering]] [^2]
			- [[desire]] = wants that can never be satisfied
			- [[ignorance]] is not seeing the world as it actually is
	- truth of the end of [[suffering]]
		- either in life or in [[spirituality|spiritual]] world aka [[enlightenment|Nirvana]] [^3]
		
[^1]: The Four Noble Truths comprise the essence of Buddha's teachings, though they leave much left unexplained. They are the truth of [[suffering]], the truth of the cause of [[suffering]], the truth of the end of [[suffering]], and the truth of the path that leads to the end of [[suffering]]. More simply put, [[suffering]] exists; it has a cause; it has an end; and it has a cause to bring about its end. The notion of [[suffering]] is not intended to convey a negative world view, but rather, a pragmatic perspective that deals with the world as it is, and attempts to rectify it. The concept of pleasure is not denied, but acknowledged as fleeting. Pursuit of pleasure can only continue what is ultimately an unquenchable thirst. The same logic belies an understanding of [[happiness]]. In the end, only aging, sickness, and death are certain and unavoidable. 
   
[^2]:   The Four Noble Truths are a contingency plan for dealing with the [[suffering]] humanity faces -- [[suffering]] of a physical kind, or of a mental nature. The First Truth identifies the presence of [[suffering]]. The Second Truth, on the other hand, seeks to determine the cause of [[suffering]]. In Buddhism, [[desire]] and [[ignorance]] lie at the root of [[suffering]]. By [[desire]], Buddhists refer to craving pleasure, material goods, and immortality, all of which are wants that can never be satisfied. As a result, desiring them can only bring [[suffering]]. [[ignorance]], in comparison, relates to not seeing the world as it actually is. Without the capacity for mental concentration and insight, Buddhism explains, one's mind is left undeveloped, unable to grasp the true nature of things. Vices, such as greed, [[envy]], hatred and anger, derive from this [[ignorance]]. 
#### path
- truth of the path that leads to the end of [[suffering]]
	- Eightfold path [^3]
		- Right Understanding
		- Right Thought
		- Right Speech
		- Right Action
		- Right Livelihood
		- Right Effort
		- Right Mindfulness 
		- Right Concentration
		
[^3]:   The Third Noble Truth, the truth of the end of [[suffering]], has dual meaning, suggesting either the end of [[suffering]] in this life, on earth, or in the spiritual life, through achieving Nirvana. When one has achieved Nirvana, which is a transcendent state free from [[suffering]] and our worldly cycle of birth and rebirth, spiritual [[enlightenment]] has been reached. The Fourth Noble truth charts the method for attaining the end of [[suffering]], known to Buddhists as the Noble Eightfold Path. The steps of the Noble Eightfold Path are Right Understanding, Right Thought, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration. Moreover, there are three themes into which the Path is divided: good moral conduct (Understanding, Thought, Speech); [[meditation]] and mental development (Action, Livelihood, Effort), and wisdom or insight (Mindfulness and Concentration).

#### karma
- [[karma]] is basically the belief that that good actions bring [[happiness]] and bad actions bring sadness IN THE LONG RUN
	- The weight of an action is determine by [^4]
		-  frequent, repetitive action
		-  determined, intentional action
		-  action performed without regret
		-  action against extraordinary persons
		-  action toward those who have helped one in the past

[^4]:  Contrary to what is accepted in contemporary society, the Buddhist interpretation of [[karma]] does not refer to preordained fate. [[Karma]] refers to good or bad actions a person takes during her lifetime. Good actions, which involve either the absence of bad actions, or actual positive acts, such as generosity, righteousness, and [[meditation]], bring about [[happiness]] in the long run. Bad actions, such as lying, stealing or killing, bring about unhappiness in the long run. The weight that actions carry is determined by five conditions: frequent, repetitive action; determined, intentional action; action performed without regret; action against extraordinary persons; and action toward those who have helped one in the past. Finally, there is also neutral [[karma]], which derives from acts such as breathing, eating or sleeping. Neutral [[karma]] has no benefits or costs.

[^5]:   The realm of man also offers one other aspect lacking in the other five planes, an opportunity to achieve [[enlightenment]], or Nirvana. Given the sheer number of living things, to be born human is to Buddhists a precious chance at spiritual bliss, a rarity that one should not forsake.
