An investigation into a term that seems to perfectly capture the indignities and absurdities of the modern [[economy]]

A [job advertisement](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/jia-tolentino/the-gig-[[economy]]-celebrates-working-yourself-to-death) celebrating sleep deprivation? That’s late [[capitalism]]. Free-wheeling Coachella outfits that somehow all look the same and cost [thousands of dollars](http://laist.com/2017/04/16/coachella_2017_style_weekend_one.php#photo-1)? Also late [[capitalism]]. Same goes for this wifi-connected $400 juicer that does no better than [human hands](http://www.avclub.com/article/lets-make-fun-400-wifi-connected-juicer-couldnt-be-254012), Pepsi’s advertisement [featuring Kendall Jenner](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-profound-silence-of-kendall-jenner), United Airlines’ [forcible removal of a seated passenger](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/04/united-video-scandal-law/522552/) who just wanted to go home, and the glorious debacle that was the Fyre Festival. The phrase—ominous, academic, despairing, sarcastic—has suddenly started showing up everywhere.

This publication has used “late [[capitalism]]” roughly two dozen times in recent years, describing everything from freakishly [oversized turkeys](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/11/the-supersized-american-turkey/281843/) to double-decker armrests for [steerage-class plane seats](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/05/a-manifesto-for-outsider-engineers/361721/). _The New Yorker_ is likewise enamored of it, invoking it in discussions of [[Bernie Sanders]] and [fancy lettuces](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/05/15/paradise-sold), among other things. There is a wildly popular, year-old [Reddit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/) devoted to it, as well as a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/HumansOfLateCapitalism/), a [Tumblr](https://humansoflatecapitalism.tumblr.com/), and a lively [Twitter hashtag](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23latecapitalism&src=typd). Google [[SEARCH]] interest in its has more than [doubled](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=late%20capitalism) in the past year.

[^1]: “Late [[capitalism]],” in its current usage, is a catchall phrase for the indignities and absurdities of our contemporary [[economy]], with its yawning inequality and super-powered corporations and shrinking [[middle class]]. But what is “late [[capitalism]],” really? Where did the phrase come from, and why did so many people start using it all of a sudden?

For my own part, I vaguely remembered it coming from the writings of Karl Marx—the decadence that precedes the [[revolution]]? I polled a few friends, and they all sort of remembered the same thing, something to do with 19th-century Europeans and the inherent instability of the capitalist system. This collective half-remembering turned out to be not quite right. “It’s not Marx’s term,” William Clare Roberts, a political scientist at McGill University, told me.

Rather, it was Marxist thinkers that came up with it to describe the industrialized economies they saw around them. A German economist named Werner Sombart seems to have been the first to use it around the turn of the 20th century, with a Marxist theorist and activist named Ernest Mandel popularizing it a half-century later. 

[^2]: For Mandel, “late [[capitalism]]” denoted the economic period that started with the end of World [[War]] II and ended in the early 1970s, a time that saw the rise of multinational corporations, mass communication, and international finance. 

[^3]: Roberts said that the term’s current usage departs somewhat from its original meaning. “It’s not this sense that things are getting so bad that the [[revolution]] is going to come,” he told me, “but rather that we see the ligaments of the international system that socialists will be able to seize and use.”

Mandel did warn about the forces of automation, globalization, and [wage stagnation](https://www.ernestmandel.org/en/works/txt/1969/where_is_america_going.htm), and feared that they would tear at the social fabric by making workers miserable. Still, during the period that he defined as “late [[capitalism]],” the American [[middle class]] was flourishing and [[Europe]] was healing. “There is an irony to it being \[originally\] used to refer to the one time things were going well for a while,” Richard Yeselson, a contributing editor at _Dissent_ and an expert on the labor movement, told me, riffing on the term.

“Late [[capitalism]]” took on a darker connotation in the works of the 20th-century critical theorists, who borrowed from and critiqued and built on Marx and the Marxists. Members of the Frankfurt School, reeling from the horrors of World [[War]] II, saw in it excessive social control on the part of big [[government]] and big [[business]]. 

[^4]: Theodor Adorno argued that “late [[capitalism]]” might lead not to socialism, but away from it, by blunting the proletariat’s potential for [[revolution]]. “The economic process continues to perpetuate domination over human beings,” he said in [a speech](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/adorno/1968/late-[[capitalism]].htm) on late [[capitalism]] in 1968. (If only he could have seen the Jenner-Pepsi ad.)

It was Duke University’s Fredric Jameson who introduced the phrase to a broader English-speaking audience of academics and theorists. “It was a much older and more popular term in German,” Jameson told me. (_Spätkapitalismus_, for those wondering.) “It’s very interesting! It’s kind of—how should I say it—symptomatic of people’s feelings about the world. About society itself,” he said, a little surprised and a little chuffed to hear that the term was finding wider appreciation. “It used to be a sort of taboo outside of [[the left]] to even mention the word ‘[[capitalism]].’ Now it’s pretty obvious that it’s there, and that’s what it is.”

In his [canonical 1984 essay](http://flawedart.net/courses/articles/Jameson_Postmodernism__cultural_logic_late_capitalism.pdf) and 1991 book, both titled _Postmodernism, or the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism_, Jameson argued that the globalized, post-industrial [[economy]] had given rise to postmodernist culture and art. Everything, everywhere, became commodified and consumable. High and low culture collapsed, with art becoming more [[self]]-referential and superficial. He told me he saw late [[capitalism]] as kicking into gear in the Thatcher and [[Reagan]] years, and persisting until today. “It has come out much more fully to the surface of things,” he said, citing the flash crash, derivatives, and “all this consumption by mail.”

It took the emergence of a new, tenacious left to jailbreak it from the ivory tower and push it into wider use. In the wake of the Great Recession, the protestors of the Occupy movement occupied; 

[^5]: the Sanders campaign found real, unexpected traction; the Fight for $15 helped convince 19 states and cities to boost their minimum wages [up to $15 an hour](http://www.nelp.org/content/uploads/PR-Minimum-Wage-Increases-New-Year-2016-2017.pdf).

Editors and writers on [[the left]] founded or expanded publications like _Jacobin_, _The New Inquiry_, and _n+1_.

Those cerebral outlets [helped to fuel renewed interest](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/15/naysayers) in Marx and critical theory, as well as late [[capitalism]]. David Graeber, a leading figure in Occupy and the coiner of the phrase “We are the 99 percent,” for instance, wrote a [long essay](http://thebaffler.com/salvos/of-flying-cars-and-the-declining-rate-of-profit) for _The Baffler_ that touched on Jameson, Mandel, corporate profitability, flying cars, and, of course, late [[capitalism]]. The novel _A Young Man’s Guide to Late Capitalism_ came out to [good reviews](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/its-complicated-peter-mountfords-a-young-mans-guide-to-late-capitalism/) in 2011. Pop-scholarly uses of the phrase started showing up in more mainstream publications, soaked up, as though by osmosis, from these publications and thinkers on the far left.

The same happened on social [[media]], itself growing rapidly as the recession gave way to the recovery. There were just a handful of mentions of “late [[capitalism]]” on Twitter [before 2009](https://twitter.com/search?q=since%3A2008-01-01%20until%3A2009-01-01%20late%20capitalism&src=typd), a few hundred [in that year](https://twitter.com/search?q=since%3A2009-01-01%20until%3A2010-01-01%20late%20capitalism&src=typd), and perhaps a few thousand in the next, many referring to college coursework.

Over time, the semantics of the phrase shifted a bit. “Late [[capitalism]]” became a catchall for incidents that capture the tragicomic inanity and inequity of contemporary [[capitalism]]. Nordstrom [selling jeans](http://www.wxyz.com/news/national/nordstrom-sells-jeans-with-fake-mud-on-them-for-425) with fake mud on them for $425. Prisoners’ phone calls costing [$14 a minute](http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/09/technology/prison-phones/). Starbucks forcing baristas to write “Come Together” on cups due to [the fiscal-cliff showdown](https://www.starbucks.com/blog/lets-come-together-[[america]]).

This usage captures the resurgent left’s anger over the recovery and the inequality that long preceded it—as well as the rage of millions of less politically engaged [[America|Americans]] who nevertheless feel left out and left behind. “I think it’s popular again now because the financial crisis and subsequent decade has really stripped away a veneer on what’s going on in the [[economy]],” Mike Konczal, a fellow at the [[FDR|Roosevelt]] Institute, told me. “Austerity, runaway top incomes, globalization, populations permanently out of the job market, competition pushed further into our everyday lives. These aren’t new, but they have an extra cruelty that is boiling over everywhere.”

The current usage also captures the perceived froth and foolishness of Silicon Valley. The gig [[economy]] in particular provides plenty of late-capitalist fodder, with investors showering cash on platforms to create cheap services for the rich and lazy and no-benefit jobs for the eager and poor. At the same time, traditional jobs seem to be providing less in the way of security, stability, and support, too. “There’s this growing discussion about how work is changing,” Carrie Gleason of the Fair Workweek Initiative told me. “The idea of what stable employment is, or what we can expect in terms of stable employment, is changing. That’s part of this.”

“Late [[capitalism]]” skewers inequality, whether businesses’ feverish attempts to sell goods to the richest of the rich (here’s looking at you, [$1,200 margarita](http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/eats/margarita-costs-1-200-basically-150-sip-article-1.2537446)) or to provide less and less to the rest (hey, airlines that make [[economy]] customers [board after pets](https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/travel/2017/02/23/the-airlines-call-basic-[[economy]]-misery-class-more-accurate/bS6Xt2wy9oDFk5Xw7IrUEM/story.html)). It lampoons brands’ attempts to mimic or co-opt the language, culture, and content of [their customers](https://twitter.com/BrandsSayingBae). Conspicuous minimalism, curated and artificial [moments of zen](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/24/vanlife-the-bohemian-social-[[media]]-movement), the gaslighting of the lifehacking and [wellness movements](http://thebaffler.com/war-of-nerves/laurie-penny-[[self-care]]): This is all late [[capitalism]].

[^6]:  Finally, “late [[capitalism]]” gestures to the potential for [[revolution]], whether because the robots end up taking all the jobs or because the proletariat finally rejects all this nonsense. A “late” period always comes at the end of something, after all. “It has the constant referent to [[revolution]],” Roberts said. “‘Late [[capitalism]]’ necessarily says, ‘This is a stage we’re going to come out of at some point, whereas ‘neoliberalism’ doesn’t say that, ‘[Shit is fucked up and bullshit](https://www.flickr.com/photos/scottlynchnyc/6301064446)’ doesn’t say that. It hints at a sort of optimism amongst a post-Bernie left, the young left online. Something of the revolutionary horizon of classical [[Marxism]].” It does all this with a certain concision, erudition, even beauty. It’s ominous and knowing, brainy and pissed-off. “Now is a crazy political time,” Yeselson said. “It’s Trump. It’s Brexit. It’s whatever is going on in [[France]]. Why talk about [[capitalism]] when nothing seems to be shaken up? But now things are shaken up. Let’s allude to the big, giant, totalistic system that is underneath everything. And let’s give it more than a hint of foreboding. Late [[capitalism]]. _Late_ is so pregnant.”

That it has strayed so far from its original meaning? Nobody I spoke with seemed to care, Jameson included, and the phrase has always had a certain malleability anyway. Sombart’s late [[capitalism]] differed from Mandel’s differed from Adorno’s differed from Jameson’s. “Late [[capitalism]]” often seems more like “the latest in [[capitalism]],” Konczal quipped.

This late [[capitalism]] is today’s, then. At least until the brands get ahold of it.

These aren’t new, but they have an extra cruelty that is boiling over everywhere.”

The current usage also captures the perceived froth and foolishness of Silicon Valley. The gig [[economy]] in particular provides plenty of late-capitalist fodder, with investors showering cash on platforms to create cheap services for the rich and lazy and no-benefit jobs for the eager and poor. At the same time, traditional jobs seem to be providing less in the way of security, stability, and support, too. “There’s this growing discussion about how work is changing,” Carrie Gleason of the Fair Workweek Initiative told me. “The idea of what stable employment is, or what we can expect in terms of stable employment, is changing. That’s part of this.”

“Late [[capitalism]]” skewers inequality, whether businesses’ feverish attempts to sell goods to the richest of the rich (here’s looking at you, [$1,200 margarita](http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/eats/margarita-costs-1-200-basically-150-sip-article-1.2537446)) or to provide less and less to the rest (hey, airlines that make [[economy]] customers [board after pets](https://www.bostonglobe.com/lifestyle/travel/2017/02/23/the-airlines-call-basic-[[economy]]-misery-class-more-accurate/bS6Xt2wy9oDFk5Xw7IrUEM/story.html)). It lampoons brands’ attempts to mimic or co-opt the language, culture, and content of [their customers](https://twitter.com/BrandsSayingBae). Conspicuous minimalism, curated and artificial [moments of zen](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/24/vanlife-the-bohemian-social-[[media]]-movement), the gaslighting of the lifehacking and [wellness movements](http://thebaffler.com/war-of-nerves/laurie-penny-[[self-care]]): This is all late [[capitalism]].

Finally, “late [[capitalism]]” gestures to the potential for [[revolution]], whether because the robots end up taking all the jobs or because the proletariat finally rejects all this nonsense. A “late” period always comes at the end of something, after all. “It has the constant referent to [[revolution]],” Roberts said. “‘Late [[capitalism]]’ necessarily says, ‘This is a stage we’re going to come out of at some point, whereas ‘neoliberalism’ doesn’t say that, ‘[Shit is fucked up and bullshit](https://www.flickr.com/photos/scottlynchnyc/6301064446)’ doesn’t say that. It hints at a sort of optimism amongst a post-Bernie left, the young left online. Something of the revolutionary horizon of classical [[Marxism]].”

It does all this with a certain concision, erudition, even beauty. It’s ominous and knowing, brainy and pissed-off. “Now is a crazy political time,” Yeselson said. “It’s Trump. It’s Brexit. It’s whatever is going on in [[France]]. Why talk about [[capitalism]] when nothing seems to be shaken up? But now things are shaken up. Let’s allude to the big, giant, totalistic system that is underneath everything. And let’s give it more than a hint of foreboding. Late [[capitalism]]. _Late_ is so pregnant.”

That it has strayed so far from its original meaning? Nobody I spoke with seemed to care, Jameson included, and the phrase has always had a certain malleability anyway. Sombart’s late [[capitalism]] differed from Mandel’s differed from Adorno’s differed from Jameson’s. “Late [[capitalism]]” often seems more like “the latest in [[capitalism]],” Konczal quipped.

This late [[capitalism]] is today’s, then. At least until the brands get ahold of it.
