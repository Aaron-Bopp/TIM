## Highlights
  
> "Nines are accepting, trusting, and stable. They are usually creative, optimistic, and supportive, but can also be too willing to go along with others to keep the peace. They want everything to go smoothly and be without conflict, but they can also tend to be complacent, simplifying problems and minimizing anything upsetting. They typically have problems with inertia and stubbornness. *At their Best*: indomitable and all-embracing, they are able to bring people together and heal conflicts."

> "They are typically “spiritual seekers” who have a great yearning for connection with the cosmos, as well as with other people. They work to maintain their peace of mind just as they work to establish peace and harmony in their world. The issues encountered in the Nine are fundamental to all psychological and spiritual work—being awake versus falling asleep to our true nature; presence versus entrancement, openness versus blockage, tension versus relaxation, peace versus pain, union versus separation"   [View Highlight](https://enneagraminstitute.com/type-9?__readwiseLocation=2%2F1%2F0%2F6%2F1%2F0%2F0%2F3%2F0%2F5%2F0%2F2%3A104%2C2%2F1%2F0%2F6%2F1%2F0%2F0%2F3%2F0%2F5%2F0%2F2%3A608#:~:text=They%20are%20typically%20%E2%80%9Cspiritual%20seekers%E2%80%9D%2Cversus%20pain%2C%20union%20versus%20separation)
