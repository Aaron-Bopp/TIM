> "Here, we build on these efforts to focus specifically onfour ways psychologists can deploy an intersectional perspec-tive in research to understand participants. Psychologistsmight consider that (1) participants are multidimensional,(2) participants’ social group memberships are dynamic, (3)power is a feature of participants’ intersectional positions,and (4) participants’ intersectional positions create outcomesof systemic advantage and disadvantage." 

  
> "Crenshaw’s (1989) original explanation of intersectional-ity depicts social group membership, not as a fixed set ofattributes, but as a process that shifts and changes in responseto structural and contextual factors. Such an understandingmakes room in psychological study for ways in which indi-viduals conceptualize, create, and strategically deploy theirown intersectional positions." 

  
> "To date, psychology has been slow to embrace intersec-tionality’s emphasis on power and systems of inequality asimportant factors that shape individuals’ lived experiences." 

  
> "Intersectional thinking directly challenges thismisconception by emphasizing the matrix of domination(Collins, 1990), whereby dominant, invisible social groupmemberships and marginalized group memberships intersectto produce one’s intersectional position."
