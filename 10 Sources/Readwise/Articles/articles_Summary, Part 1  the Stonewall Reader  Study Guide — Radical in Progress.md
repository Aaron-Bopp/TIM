## Highlights
  
> "The Stonewall uprising was a protest sparked by, “a police raid on a Mafia-owned gay bar and dance spot that had no running water, where glasses were “washed” in filthy suds and reused, and which was “protected” by straight, extortionate Mafia goons”" 

  
> "Stonewall was a catalyst for the Gay Liberation movement and a signal of resistance to society"
