## Highlights
  
> "I argue that school bullying needs to be understood not only in terms of the interactions between individuals or groups of individuals, but also in terms of the specific gendered social-ecological environment within which those interactions occur." 

  
> "Much of the research that has been conducted more specifically into aggression and school bullying has instead been conceptualized along a continuum, from gender blindness to gender essentialism, whereby either the focus has been on the behaviour of boys or explanations of gender differences have been tied to biology" 

  
> "later research investigating aggression and school bullying found that while boys tend to be directly aggressive (both physically and verbally), girls tend to be indirectly or relationally so (Björkqvist, Lagerspetz, and Kaukiainen 1992Björkqvist, Kaj, Kirsti M. J. Lagerspetz, and Ari Kaukiainen. 1992. “Do Girls Manipulate and Boys Fight?

Bullying at School: What We Know and What We Can Do. Oxford: Blackwell. [Crossref], [Google Scholar])." 

  
> "these early studies did not explicitly discuss gender or its importance to the power relations of school bullying" 

  
> "While theorizations of socialization and sex roles are a significant improvement on the previously gender-blind discussions of school bullying, they tend to exaggerate the role of individuals and the choices they make and minimize the importance of the power relations within which they are situated (Brittan 1989Brittan, Arthur. 1989. Masculinity and Power. Oxford: Basil Blackwell. [Google Scholar]; Carrigan, Connell, and Lee 1985Carrigan, Tim, Bob Connell, and John Lee. 1985. “Toward a New Sociology of Masculinity.” Theory and Society 14 (5): 551–604. [Crossref], [Web of Science ®], [Google Scholar]; Connell 1995Connell, R. W. 1995. Masculinities. Cambridge: Polity Press. [Google Scholar])." 

Q:: What is Masculinism and how does it relate to the masculinity and the patriarchy?   
A::
Masculinism is an ideology that justifies male domination and upholds the patriarchy. Masculinism is taught intrinsically and as the only option forcing males to position themselves within it. Masculinity are simply traits that appear more in men.   ^pnc7zu
> ", Brittan (1989Brittan, Arthur. 1989. Masculinity and Power. Oxford: Basil Blackwell. [Google Scholar]) coined the term masculinism to distinguish between masculinity and the ideology that upholds male domination. As Brittan (1989Brittan, Arthur. 1989. Masculinity and Power. Oxford: Basil Blackwell. [Google Scholar], 4) argued: ‘Those people who speak of masculinity as an essence, as an inborn characteristic, are confusing masculinity with masculinism, the masculine ideology. Masculinism is the ideology that justifies and naturalizes male domination.’ As Whitehead (2002Whitehead, Stephen M. 2002. Men and Masculinities. Cambridge: Polity. [Google Scholar], 98) has argued, masculinism can also be thought of as ‘a dominant discourse rather than a dominant ideology.’ For boys, then, the question is not whether to take on a typical male sex role, but rather how to position themselves according to the masculine discourses available to them."
