### [Existential Dread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUC8qF5iDag)
- [[Neuroscience]]

##### Chemicals that cause the brain to focus
- When under stress people are unable to focus on things other than the stressors ^wrht21
	- Adrenaline hits in seconds and lasts for minutes
	- Cortisol hits within the hour and last for 4-24 hours
		- Basically keeps you on guard so that you're easier to wake from sleep, more aware, etc.
	- These we formed for physical forms of stress (tigers) but now effect us even for mental stressors 
##### Our brains design
- our brains are not designed for correcting the dissonance between thoughts and conclusions ^7qn6tt
	- our brains are designed to make certainty out of uncertainty/find reasons for illogical decisions
		- if given too many options the brain will make choices that we cannot immediately understand the reasons for
	- if we get paralyzed through lack of knowledge we won't act 
		- existential dread comes from the knowledge that we are ignorant/can't fully understand the world
#####
- [[neurosis]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neurosis) -> the tendency to worry
	- as a human, a lot of what is good for us makes us suffer
		- most professional success comes from conscientiousness and neuroticism 
- [[five-factor model]]
- [[neuroticism]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neuroticism) -> sometimes defined as a tendency for quick arousal when stimulated and slow relaxation from arousal, especially with regard to negative emotional arousal.
	- Is a trait in many models within personality theory, but there is significant disagreement on its definition
- [Conscientiousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientiousness) -> the personality trait of being careful, or diligent. 
	- Conscientiousness implies a [[desire]] to do a task well, and to take obligations to others seriously. 
	- Conscientious people tend to be efficient and organized as opposed to easy-going and disorderly.
- Difference between anxious thoughts vs a feeling of existential dread
	- Your feelings can manifest as thoughts
	- Feeling alone in the world can come from people fundamentally not understanding you at an early age
##### The way the mind works 
- Mamos -> emotional mind
	- happens within 0-1s and then stores the emotional state
	- Examples
		- emotional
		- likes/dislikes
		- reacts
		- guttural
		- sense
- Buddhi -> analytical mind
	- Processing emotions
	- using stored coping mechanisms to deal with stored emotional states
	- examples
		- "just try it"
		- "experience new things"
##### Competence comes from empathic mirroring
- [[Confidence]] problems come from when [[parents]] can't mirror the child's emotional needs ^d7aec9
	- [[Attachment Theory]]
