### [How We're Shaped Mentally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDTPg_qKvn8)

- Nihachu's mother had problems with addiction
- very shy, insecure, quiet growing up
- Streaming helped growing and understanding things that were confusing as a kid
- Wants to become psychiatrist and help people the way she was helped
- #Ref/DrK If you are worth caring for, it rewrites your history, because everything that happened to you shouldn't have happened to you
- Being strong for getting over it vs acknowledging that it wasn't okay that it happened
- niki thinks that if she can use it to help other people it will be worth it but nothing makes it worth it
- you have value no matter what you accomplish
- #Ref/DrK "You were wronged and it wasn't ok and you didn't deserve it and it doesn't make sense"
- #TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH  [[Emotional Quotent]] or EQ
