#### <s class="topic-title">[[Evangelicalism]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [Evangelicalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism)
> 
> In:: [[Christianity]],
> Evangelicalism is a worldwide interdenominational movement that maintains the belief that the essence of the Gospel consists of the doctrine of salvation by grace alone, solely through faith in Jesus' atonement. 
> Evangelicals believe in the centrality of the conversion or "born again" experience in receiving salvation, in the authority of the Bible as God's revelation to humanity, and in spreading the Christian message.
> 
> Its origins are usually traced to 1738, with various theological streams contributing to its foundation.
> Preeminently, John Wesley and other early Methodists were at the root of sparking this new movement during the [[First Great Awakening]]. Today, evangelicals are found across many Protestant branches, as well as in various denominations not subsumed to a specific branch.
> 
> In 2016, there were an estimated 619 million evangelicals in the world, meaning that one in four Christians would be classified as evangelical. The United States has the largest proportion of evangelicals in the world. American evangelicals are a quarter of that nation's population and its single largest religious group. As a trans-denominational coalition, evangelicals can be found in nearly every Protestant denomination and tradition, particularly within the Reformed ([[Calvinism|Calvinist]]), Baptist, Methodist (Wesleyan-Arminian), Moravian, Mennonite, Pentecostal and charismatic churches.

Because of Evangelicalism's close tie with American charismatic's is often used synonymously with [[Charistmaticism]]
