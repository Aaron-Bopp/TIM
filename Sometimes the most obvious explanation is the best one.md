#### [[Sometimes the most obvious explanation is the best one]]

We don't argue that a can opener was designed for anything else than to open cans because that explanation is so obvious.
In modern [[society]], we have trained ourselves to be skeptical of easy solutions.
This is often the best strategy as helps us avoid
[[Experts are often far too confident in the effectiveness of their theories]].
The flip side of this is valuing high complexity explanations over simple explanations because of the perception of more [[information]],
but a self-evident theory may be just as true.
We may need to take a step back and look at the [[information]] from a different perspective
ala [[Adaptations are only clear when studied at the correct scale]],
and then we will see that there is far more information supporting the more simple theory
