> [!wikipedia] [basolateral amygdala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basolateral%20amygdala)
> 
> The basolateral [[amygdala]], or basolateral complex, consists of the lateral, basal and accessory-basal nuclei of the [[amygdala]]. The lateral nuclei receives the majority of sensory information, which arrives directly from the temporal lobe structures, including the [[hippocampus]] and [[primary auditory cortex]]. 

> [!wikipedia]- How the BLA learns
> 
> The basolateral amygdala also receives dense neuromodulatory inputs from ventral tegmental area (VTA), locus coeruleus (LC), and basal forebrain, whose integrity are important for associative learning. The information is then processed by the basolateral complex and is sent as output to the central nucleus of the amygdala. This is how most emotional arousal is formed in mammals.
