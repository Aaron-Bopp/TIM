#### <s class="topic-title">[[quantum field theory]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum%20field%20theory)
> 
> In:: [[theoretical physics]],
> quantum field theory (QFT) is a theoretical [[framework]] that combines [[classical field theory]], [[special relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]].: xi  QFT is used in [[particle physics]] to construct physical models of subatomic particles and in condensed matter physics to construct models of quasiparticles.
> 
> QFT treats particles as excited states (also called [[quanta]]) of their underlying quantum fields, which are more fundamental than the particles. Interactions between particles are described by interaction terms in the Lagrangian involving their corresponding quantum fields. Each interaction can be visually represented by Feynman diagrams according to perturbation theory in quantum mechanics.
