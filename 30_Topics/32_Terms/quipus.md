#### <s class="topic-title">[[quipus]]</s>

> Quipu (also spelled khipu) are recording devices fashioned from strings historically used by a number of cultures in the region of Andean South America. Knotted strings for collecting data, government management and keeping records were also used by the ancient Chinese, Tibetans and Japanese, but such practices should not be confused with the quipu, which refers only to the Andean method.

> A quipu usually consisted of cotton or camelid fiber strings. The Inca people used them for collecting data and keeping records, monitoring tax obligations, properly collecting census records, calendrical information, and for military organization. The cords stored numeric and other values encoded as knots, often in a base ten positional system. A quipu could have only a few or thousands of cords. The configuration of the quipus has been "compared to string mops." Archaeological evidence has also shown the use of finely carved wood as a supplemental, and perhaps sturdier, base to which the color-coded cords would be attached. A relatively small number have survived.

> Objects that can be identified unambiguously as quipus first appear in the archaeological record in the first millennium AD (though debated quipus are much earlier).  They subsequently played a key part in the administration of the Kingdom of Cusco and later Tawantinsuyu, the empire controlled by the Inca ethnic group, flourishing across the Andes from c. 1100 to 1532 AD. Some have argued that as the region was subsumed under the Spanish Empire, the quipus were actively destroyed, to be replaced by European writing and numeral systems; but the Spanish response to the quipu is much more complicated than this. While certainly some quipu were identified as idolatrous and destroyed, the Spaniards actually promoted the adaptation of the quipu recording system to the needs of the colonial administration; and priests advocated the use of quipus for ecclesiastical purposes. In several modern villages, quipus have continued to be important items for the local community, albeit for ritual rather than practical use. It is unclear as to where and how many intact quipus still exist, as many have been stored away in mausoleums.Quipu is the Spanish spelling and the most common spelling in English. Khipu (pronounced [ˈkʰɪpʊ], plural: khipukuna) is the word for "knot" in Cusco Quechua. In most Quechua varieties, the term is kipu.
