`$=customJS.dv_funcs.mentionedIn(dv)`

A disorder in which people have recurring, unwanted thoughts, ideas or sensations (obsessions) that make them feel driven to do something repetitively (compulsions). The repetitive behaviors, such as hand washing, checking on things or cleaning, can significantly interfere with a personâ€™s daily activities and social interactions.
