> Based on Sartre’s argument that there is no fixed [[morality]] or [[human nature]] to determine human action, he believes that humans have radical [[freedom]]. This means that people have the absolute power to choose how they will act in any given situation and in their lives as a whole. Tomorrow morning, anyone could choose to become a vegan or take up snowboarding, quit school to become a farmer, or go on a crime spree. These choices are not individual in the sense that they don’t affect other people, but rather in the sense that nobody else can override one’s own conscience.
> 
> In fact, it is precisely because of this radical freedom that people are wholly responsible for the choices they make and for the people they become, even if their control over their choices does not imply control over every outcome
