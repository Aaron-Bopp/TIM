#### <s class="topic-title">[[Japa Meditation]]</s> 

Also known as sequential [[mantra]] [[meditation]], or [[prayer beads]] based [[meditation]], the technique consists or repeating a [[mantra]] a certain number of times. This amount is based on your [[prayer beads]] but you can also use the segments of your fingers. While "Om" is an appropriate [[mantra]], a personal mantra given to you by a guru will be more powerful.
