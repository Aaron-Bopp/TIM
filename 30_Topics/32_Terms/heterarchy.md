> [!wikipedia] [Heterarchy - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterarchy)
> 
> A heterarchy is a system of [[organization]] where the elements of the organization are unranked (non-hierarchical) or where they possess the potential to be ranked a number of different ways. 
> 
> A heterarchy may be parallel to a [[hierarchy]], subsumed to a hierarchy, or it may contain hierarchies; the two kinds of structure are not mutually exclusive. 
> ^[[[Organization systems are not mutually exclusive]]]
> In fact, each level in a hierarchical system is composed of a potentially heterarchical group which contains its constituent elements.
> 
> The concept of heterarchy was first employed in a modern context by Warren McCulloch in 1945. As Carole L. Crumley has summarized, "[h]e examined alternative cognitive structure(s), the collective organization of which he termed heterarchy. He demonstrated that the human brain, while reasonably orderly was not organized hierarchically. 
> ^[[[A second brain should mirror how we think]]]
> This understanding revolutionized the neural study of the brain and solved major problems in the fields of [[AI|artificial intelligence]] and computer design."
