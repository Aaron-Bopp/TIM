Usually refering to [[wikilinks]] in a system like [[Obsidian (software)|Obsidian]] or [[Roam Research (software)|Roam]] a bi-directional link is just like a normal [[hyperlink]] on the web, except that when this link is created it can be accessed from the place it is linking to through a backlinks section. This kind of linking system is usually associated with a [[knowledge graph]] that shows these connections.

**See**:: [[web of thought]], [[second brain]]
