#### <s class="topic-title">[[internet]]</s>

In:: [[technology]], 
the internet is a marvel of [[infrastructure]] and engineering,
allowing for almost instantaneous [[communication]] across the globe.
The power and dangers of the internet can not be overstated.

In:: the [[human experience]] and [[history]],
the internet is probably the most influential invention ever.
The internet has changed how we lead almost every second of our lives, from completing the Wordle the second we wake up to listening to a podcast as we fall asleep, 
all without physically interacting with another person.

In:: [[Psychology]],
we are still trying to understand the affects of the internet on us and our children.

In:: [[society]],
the internet has allowed us access to people and experiences that would have been known only to a few before.
We have unlimited access to people who agree with us,
and can completely eliminate access to people who disagree with us.
