#### <s class="topic-title">[[Complex systems theory]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [Complex systems theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex%20system)
> 
> A complex system is a system composed of many components which may interact with each other. 
> 
> Complex systems are systems whose behavior is intrinsically difficult to model due to the dependencies, competitions, relationships, or other types of interactions between their parts or between a given system and its environment. Systems that are "complex" have distinct properties that arise from these relationships, such as nonlinearity, emergence, spontaneous order, adaptation, and feedback loops, among others. Because such systems appear in a wide variety of fields, the commonalities among them have become the topic of their independent area of research. In many cases, it is useful to represent such a system as a network where the nodes represent the components and links to their interactions.
> 
> Complex systems can be understood as an alternative [[paradigm]] to [[reductionism]], which attempts to explain systems in terms of their constituent parts and the individual interactions between them.
