#### <s class="topic-title">[[Dante's inferno]]</s>


> [!wikipedia] [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno%20(Dante))
> 
> Inferno is the first part of Italian writer Dante Alighieri's 14th-century epic poem Divine Comedy. 
> In the poem, Hell is depicted as nine concentric circles of torment located within the Earth; it is the "realm ... of those who have rejected spiritual values by yielding to bestial appetites or [[violence]], or by perverting their human intellect to fraud or malice against their fellowmen".
> 
> As an allegory, the Divine Comedy represents the journey of the soul toward God, with the Inferno describing the recognition and rejection of sin.
