#### <s class="topic-title">[[Homo erectus]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [Homo erectus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo%20erectus)
> 
> Homo erectus (meaning "upright man") is an extinct species of archaic human from the [[Pleistocene]], with its earliest occurrence about 2 million years ago, and its specimens are among the first recognizable members of the genus Homo. 
> 
> H. erectus was the first human ancestor to spread throughout Eurasia, with a continental range extending from the Iberian Peninsula to Java. African populations of H. erectus are likely to be the ancestors to several human species, such as H. heidelbergensis and H. antecessor, with the former generally considered to have been the ancestor to Neanderthals, Denisovans, and modern humans. 
> 
> Though brain size certainly exceeds that of ancestor species, capacity varied widely depending on the population. In older populations, brain development seemed to cease early in childhood, suggesting that offspring were largely self-sufficient at birth, thus limiting cognitive development through life. Nonetheless, sites generally show consumption of medium to large animals, such as bovines or elephants, and suggest the development of predatory [[behavior]] and coordinated hunting. 
> 
> H. erectus is associated with the Acheulean stone tool industry, and is postulated to have been the earliest human ancestor capable of using fire, hunting and gathering in coordinated groups, caring for injured or sick group members, and possibly seafaring and art (though examples of art are controversial, and are otherwise rudimentary and few and far between).
> 
> H. erectus men and women may have been roughly the same size as each other (i.e. exhibited reduced sexual dimorphism) like modern humans, which could indicate monogamy in line with general trends exhibited in primates. Size, nonetheless, ranged widely from 146–185 cm (4 ft 9 in – 6 ft 1 in) in height and 40–68 kg (88–150 lb) in weight. It is unclear if H. erectus was anatomically capable of speech, though it is postulated they communicated using some proto-language.
