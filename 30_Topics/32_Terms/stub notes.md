#### <s class="topic-title">[[stub notes]]</s>

In:: [[web of thought|webs of thought]] and [[networked thinking]],
stub notes are [[Topic notes]] that do not have and content and are there to easily access their metadata (backlinks, graph positioning).

> Systems which display backlinks to a node permit a new behavior: you can define a new node extensionally (rather than intentionally) by simply linking to it from many other nodesâ€”even before it has any content.
^[[Backlinks can be used to implicitly define nodes in knowledge management systems](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2newCwFfd6iZFyf9bgspkbyt1G8wbQxJVgTK)]
