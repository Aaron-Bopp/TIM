#### <s class="topic-title">[[High-yielding variety]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [High-yielding variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-yielding%20variety)
> 
> High-yielding varieties (HYVs) of agricultural [[crops]] are usually characterized by a combination of the following traits in contrast to the conventional varieties:
> - Higher crop yield per area (hectare)
> - Dwarfness
> - Improved response to fertilizers
> - High reliance on irrigation and fertilizers - see intensive farming
> - Early maturation
> - Resistive to many diseases
> 
> Most important HYVs can be found among wheat, corn, soybean, rice, potato, and cotton. They are heavily used in commercial and plantation farms.
> 
> HYVs become popular in the 1960s and play an important role in the [[Green Revolution]], although their ancestral roots can be older.
