#### <s class="topic-title">[[foraging]]</s>

This was a time period that encompassed much of [[prehistory]] and coincided [[human evolution]]. 

> [!wikipedia] [foraging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foraging)
> 
> Foraging is searching for wild food resources. It affects an animal's fitness because it plays an important role in an animal's ability to survive and reproduce. Foraging theory is a branch of behavioral ecology that studies the foraging behavior of animals in response to the environment where the animal lives.
> 
> Behavioral ecologists use economic models and categories to understand foraging; many of these models are a type of optimal model. Thus foraging theory is discussed in terms of optimizing a payoff from a foraging decision. The payoff for many of these models is the amount of energy an animal receives per unit time, more specifically, the highest ratio of energetic gain to cost while foraging.  Foraging theory predicts that the decisions that maximize energy per unit time and thus deliver the highest payoff will be selected for and persist. Key words used to describe foraging behavior include resources, the elements necessary for survival and reproduction which have a limited supply, predator, any organism that consumes others, prey, an organism that is eaten in part or whole by another, and patches, concentrations of resources.
> 
> Behavioral ecologists first tackled this topic in the 1960s and 1970s. Their goal was to quantify and formalize a set of models to test their null hypothesis that animals forage randomly. Important contributions to foraging theory have been made by:
> 
> 
> 
> Eric Charnov, who developed the marginal value theorem to predict the behavior of foragers using patches;
> 
> Sir John Krebs, with work on the optimal diet model in relation to tits and chickadees;
> 
> John Goss-Custard, who first tested the optimal diet model against behavior in the field, using redshank, and then proceeded to an extensive study of foraging in the common pied oystercatcher

#### Foraging naturally kept population down

[[Foraging kept populations down]]

#### Foraging was not simply about survival 

> ![[books_Sapiens#^297094622]]

#### Foragers were less likely to get diseases

[[Foraging allowed for a diverse diet]]

By 8500 BC the [[Middle East]] was peppered with small villages centered around wheat production.

While human foraging would never completely fade slowly [[farming]] would take over as the dominant way of life.
