#### <s class="topic-title">[[ANS]]</s>

The **Autonomic Nervous System** is the system that regulates the functions of our internal organs (the viscera) such as the [[heart]], [[stomach]] and [[intestines]]. The **ANS** is part of the [[peripheral nervous system]] and it also controls some of the muscles within the [[body]].

> The autonomic nervous system (ANS), formerly referred to as the vegetative nervous system, is a division of the [[peripheral nervous system]] that supplies [[smooth muscle]] and [[glands]], and thus influences the function of internal organs. The autonomic nervous system is a control system that acts largely unconsciously and regulates bodily functions, such as the [[heart rate]], [[digestion]], [[respiratory rate]], [[pupillary response]], [[urination]], and [[sexual arousal]]. This system is the primary mechanism in control of the [[fight-or-flight response]].
> 
> The autonomic nervous system is regulated by integrated reflexes through the [[brainstem]] to the [[spinal cord]] and organs. Autonomic functions include control of respiration, cardiac regulation (the cardiac control center), vasomotor activity (the vasomotor center), and certain reflex actions such as coughing, sneezing, swallowing and vomiting. 
> 
> Those are then subdivided into other areas and are also linked to autonomic subsystems and the peripheral nervous system. The [[hypothalamus]], just above the brain stem, acts as an integrator for autonomic functions, receiving autonomic regulatory input from the [[limbic system]].
> 
> The autonomic nervous system has three branches: the [[sympathetic nervous system]], the [[parasympathetic nervous system]] and the [[enteric nervous system]]. ^[Some textbooks do not include the enteric nervous system as part of this system.] 
> 
> Most autonomous functions are involuntary but they can often work in conjunction with the somatic nervous system which provides voluntary control.
