#### <s class="topic-title">[[confidence]]</s>

[[Confidence is a feedback loop]],
those without it may fail or not try because they lack it and those with it may succeed because they have it whether or not it is warranted.

[[Confidence comes when you are more capable of handling diverse outcomes]], in this way it is the opposite of [[anxiety]], 
[[Anxiety stems from a lack of confidence for the future]].
