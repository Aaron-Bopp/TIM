A [[herb]] native to Asia that has been used as a tonic to improve well-being and energy booster for thousands of years. It is promoted as a dietary supplement for a variety of reasons (to improve physical stamina, concentration, and memory; stimulate immune function; slow the aging process) and relieve various health problems (such as respiratory and cardiovascular disorders, [[depression]], [[anxiety]], and menopausal hot flashes). There are uncertainties about whether ginseng might interact with certain medications. Please consult with your healthcare provider before taking any herbal supplements.
