#### <s class="topic-title">[[adaptation]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [adaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation)
> 
> In:: [[biology]],
> adaptation has three related meanings. Firstly, it is the dynamic evolutionary process that fits organisms to their environment. Secondly, it is a state reached by the population during that process. Thirdly, it is a [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] trait or adaptive trait, with a functional role in each individual organism, that is maintained and has evolved through [[natural selection]].
> 
> Adaptation is related to biological fitness, which governs the rate of [[evolution]] as measured by change in gene frequencies. Often, two or more species co-adapt and co-evolve as they develop adaptations that interlock with those of the other species, such as with flowering plants and pollinating insects.
