##### <s class="topic-title">[[Ambivalent Sexism]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [Ambivalent Sexism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambivalent%20sexism)
> 
> Ambivalent sexism is a theoretical framework which posits that sexism has two sub-components: [[Hostile sexism]] and [[Benevolent sexism]]. For the most part, psychologists have studied hostile forms of [[sexism]]. However, theorists using the theoretical framework of ambivalent sexism have found extensive empirical evidence for both varieties. The theory has largely been developed by social psychologists [[Peter Glick]] and [[Susan Fiske]].
