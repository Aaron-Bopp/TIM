> [!wikipedia] [domestication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication)
> 
> Domestication is a sustained multi-generational relationship in which humans assume a significant degree of control over the reproduction and care of another group of organisms such as plants or animals to secure a more predictable supply of resources from that group. 
> 
> The domestication of plants began at least 12,000 years ago with cereals in the [[Middle East]], and the bottle gourd in [[Asia]]. [[Agriculture]] developed in at least 11 different centres around the world, domesticating different crops and animals.

> [!Wikipedia]- Genetic underpinning of domestication
> 
> Charles Darwin recognized the small number of traits that made domestic species different from their wild ancestors. He was also the first to recognize the difference between conscious selective breeding in which humans directly select for desirable traits, and unconscious selection where traits evolve as a by-product of [[natural selection]].
> 
> There is a genetic difference between domestic and wild populations. There is also such a difference between the domestication traits that researchers believe to have been essential at the early stages of domestication, and the improvement traits that have appeared since the split between wild and domestic populations.

### How did selective hunting lead to domestication of animals?

While some species like dogs lend themselves easily to domestication, other animals likely needed more time and attention to domesticate.
This likely involved a combined process of intentional and unintentional selection by early humans.

[[Early hunting techniques lead to domesticating farm animals]]
First they killed older animals and spared fertile young animals, then they defended the herd against other predators. This lead them to coral the animals into defensible areas. Finally they started killing off the most aggressive and skinny animals, and allowed the docile and fat animals to reproduce.

Alternatively, humans may have taken more strait foreword attempt of 'adopting' and feeding animals before slaughtering them.
^[[[books_Sapiens#^297681716]]]
Likely, there was a mix of these two techniques, with the second technique being enabled by the first in some cases

The most intentional part of human domestication was castration and violence to push animals to be more docile and ready to work.
