A condition that affects the way your [[brain]] processes information. It causes you to lose touch with reality. You might see, hear, or believe things that aren't real. Psychosis is a symptom, not an illness. A mental or physical [[illness]], substance [[abuse]], or extreme [[stress]] or [[trauma]] can cause it.
