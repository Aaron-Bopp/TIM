##### <s class="topic-title">[[Lambda-CDM model]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [Lambda-CDM model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM%20model)
> 
> The ΛCDM (Lambda cold [[dark matter]]) or Lambda-CDM model is a parameterization of [[the Big Bang]] cosmological model in which the [[universe]] contains three major components: first, a cosmological constant denoted by Lambda (Greek Λ) associated with [[dark energy]]; second, the postulated cold dark matter (abbreviated CDM); and third, ordinary [[matter]]. 
> 
> The ΛCDM model can be extended by adding cosmological inflation, quintessence and other elements that are current areas of speculation and research in [[cosmology]].
> 
> Some alternative models challenge the assumptions of the ΛCDM model. Examples of these are modified [[Newtonian dynamics]], [[entropic gravity]], [[modified gravity]], theories of large-scale variations in the matter density of the universe, [[bimetric gravity]], scale invariance of empty space, and decaying dark matter (DDM).
