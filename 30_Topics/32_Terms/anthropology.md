> Anthropology is the scientific study of humanity, concerned with [[human behavior]], [[human biology]], [[Culture]], [[society]], and [[linguistics]], in both the present and past, including past human species. Social anthropology studies patterns of [[behavior]], while cultural anthropology studies cultural meaning, including norms and values. A portmanteau sociocultural anthropology is commonly used today. Linguistic anthropology studies how [[language]] influences [[social life]]. Biological or physical anthropology studies the biological development of humans.
> 
> Archaeological anthropology, often termed as 'anthropology of the past', studies human activity through investigation of physical evidence. It is considered a branch of anthropology in North America and Asia, while in Europe archaeology is viewed as a discipline in its own right or grouped under other related disciplines, such as history.
