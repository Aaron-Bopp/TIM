#### <s class="topic-title">[[spaced repetition]]</s>

In:: [[learning]] and [[education]],
spaced repetition is a way of increasing your ability to recall [[information]].

In:: [[knowledge management]],
spaced repetition is additionally seen as a way to resurface information at spaced intervals in the hopes of being able to find use for it over time.

> Spaced repetition is an evidence-based learning technique that is usually performed with flashcards. Newly introduced and more difficult flashcards are shown more frequently, while older and less difficult flashcards are shown less frequently in order to exploit the psychological [[spacing effect]]. The use of spaced repetition has been proven to increase the rate of learning.

Spaced repetition has received backlash not because it is ineffective, but because it is often conveyed as more effective than it actually is.
These complaints normally revolve around the time it requires, the lack of context, and the focus on rote memory.
Alternatives usually include more involved methods of [[learning]] such as [[Blooms taxonomy]] or [[inquiry based learning]].
