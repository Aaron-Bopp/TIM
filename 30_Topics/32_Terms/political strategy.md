#### <s class="topic-title">[[political strategy]]</s>

If [[Politics]] are the "set of activities that are associated with making decisions in groups" and [[political science]] is the study of those activities, political strategy is the art of turning those activities to your advantage at every turn. 

Most of Politics involves political strategy, but not all of political strategy involves politics.

Politics involves the actions that politicians make, and political strategy involves the reasoning they use to make those decisions.

[[Policy]] also does not fully capture political strategy as much of a politicians job involves just getting to the point of making policy.

#### Discussion
[[political strategy]] plays on [[political behavior]].

> [!wikipedia] [political behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theories%20of%20political%20behavior)
> 
> Theories of political behavior, as an aspect of political science, attempt to quantify and explain the influences that define a person's political views, ideology, and levels of political participation. Political behavior is the subset of human behavior that involves politics and power. Theorists who have had an influence on this field include Karl Deutsch and Theodor Adorno.
