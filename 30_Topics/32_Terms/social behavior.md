Interaction between of organisms that forms a [[interpersonal relationships]].

For [[social behavior]] specifically in humans see [[human behavior]].

Behavior is in the moment, relationship is over time.

> Social behavior is [[behavior]] among two or more [[organisms]] within the same [[species]], and encompasses any behavior in which one member affects the other.
> 
> Social behavior can be seen as similar to an exchange of goods, with the expectation that when you give, you will receive the same. This behavior can be affected by both the qualities of the individual and the environmental (situational) factors. Therefore, social behavior arises as a result of an interaction between the twoâ€”the organism and its environment.

> A major aspect of social behavior is [[communication]], which is the basis for [[human survival|survival]] and [[reproduction]]. 

> [!wikipedia]- What determines behavior?
>
> Social behavior is said to be determined by two different processes, that can either work together or oppose one another. The [[dual-systems model]] of reflective and impulsive determinants of social behavior came out of the realization that behavior cannot just be determined by one single factor. Instead, behavior can arise by those consciously behaving (where there is an awareness and intent), or by pure impulse. These factors that determine behavior can work in different situations and moments, and can even oppose one another. While at times one can behave with a specific goal in mind, other times they can behave without rational control, and driven by impulse instead.
> 
> There are also distinctions between different types of social behavior, such as mundane versus defensive social behavior. Mundane social behavior is a result of interactions in day-to-day life, and are behaviors learned as one is exposed to those different situations. On the other hand, defensive behavior arises out of impulse, when one is faced with conflicting desires.
