#### <s class="topic-title">[[empiricism]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [empiricism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism)
> 
> In:: [[philosophy]], 
> empiricism is a theory that states that knowledge comes only or primarily from sensory experience.  It is one of several views of [[epistemology]], along with [[rationalism]] and [[skepticism]]. Empiricism emphasizes the role of empirical evidence in the formation of ideas, rather than innate ideas or traditions. However, empiricists may argue that traditions (or customs) arise due to relations of previous sensory experiences.
> 
> Historically, empiricism was associated with the "blank slate" concept (tabula rasa), according to which the human mind is "blank" at birth and develops its thoughts only through experience.
> 
> Empiricism in the philosophy of science emphasizes evidence, especially as discovered in experiments. It is a fundamental part of the scientific method that all hypotheses and theories must be tested against observations of the natural world rather than resting solely on a priori reasoning, intuition, or revelation.
