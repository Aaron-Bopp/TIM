> Phenomenology is the philosophical study of the structures of [[experience]] and [[consciousness]]. 
> 
> Phenomenology, in Husserl's conception, is primarily concerned with the systematic reflection on and study of the structures of consciousness and the phenomena that appear in acts of consciousness. 
> Phenomenology can be clearly differentiated from the Cartesian method of analysis which sees the world as objects, sets of objects, and objects acting and reacting upon one another.
> 
> Husserl's conception of phenomenology has been criticized and developed not only by him, but also by students and colleagues.
