> [!wikipedia] [metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics)
> 
> Metaphysics is the branch of [[philosophy]] that studies the fundamental nature of [[reality]], the first principles of being, identity and change, space and time, causality, necessity, and possibility.
> It includes questions about the nature of [[consciousness]] and the relationship between [[mind]] and [[matter]], between substance and attribute, and between potentiality and actuality.
> Metaphysics studies questions related to what it is for something to exist and what types of existence there are. Metaphysics seeks to answer, in an abstract and fully general manner, the questions:
> 
> 1.  What _is there_?
> 2.  What is it _like_?
>
