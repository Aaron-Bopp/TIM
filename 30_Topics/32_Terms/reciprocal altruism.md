#### <s class="topic-title">[[reciprocal altruism]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [reciprocal altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocal%20altruism)
> 
> In [[Evolutionary Biology]], reciprocal altruism is a [[behavior]] whereby an organism acts in a manner that temporarily reduces its fitness while increasing another organism's fitness, with the expectation that the other organism will act in a similar manner at a later time. 
> 
> The concept was initially developed by [[Robert Trivers]] to explain the evolution of cooperation as instances of mutually altruistic acts. The concept is close to the strategy of "tit for tat" used in [[game theory]].
