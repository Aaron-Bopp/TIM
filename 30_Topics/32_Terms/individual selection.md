##### <s class="topic-title">[[individual selection]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [individual selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological%20selection)
> 
> Ecological selection (or environmental selection or survival selection or individual selection or asexual selection) refers to [[natural selection]] without [[sexual selection]], i.e. strictly ecological processes that operate on a species' inherited traits without reference to mating or secondary sex characteristics.  The variant names describe varying circumstances where sexual selection is wholly suppressed as a mating factor. Ecologists often study ecological selection when examining the abundance of individuals per population across regions, and what governs such abundances.
