> [!wikipedia] [Between-group design > Practice effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Between-group_design#Practice_effect)
> 
> A practice effect is the outcome/performance change resulting from repeated testing. This is best described by the [Power Law of Practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Law_of_Practice "Power Law of Practice"): If multiple levels or some other variable variation are tested repeatedly (which is the case in between-group experiments), the subjects within each sub-group become more familiarized with testing conditions, thus increasing responsiveness and performance.
