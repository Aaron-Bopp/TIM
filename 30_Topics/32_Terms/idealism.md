#### <s class="topic-title">[[idealism]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism)
> 
> In:: [[philosophy]], 
> the term idealism identifies and describes metaphysical perspectives which assert that reality is indistinguishable and inseparable from human [[perception]] and [[understanding]]; that reality is a mental construct closely connected to ideas. 
> 
> Idealist perspectives are in two categories: 
> 1. [[Subjective idealism]], which proposes that a material object exists only to the extent that a human being perceives the object
> 2. [[Objective idealism]], which proposes the existence of an objective [[consciousness]] that exists prior to and independently of human consciousness, thus the existence of the object is independent of human [[perception]].
> 
> In contrast to materialism, idealism asserts the primacy of [[consciousness]] as the origin and prerequisite of phenomena. Idealism holds that consciousness (the mind) is the origin of the material world.
