#### <s class="topic-title">[[cuneiform]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [cuneiform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform)
> 
> Cuneiform is a logo-syllabic script that was used to write several languages of the Ancient Near East. The script was in active use from the early Bronze Age until the beginning of the Common Era. It is named for the characteristic wedge-shaped impressions (Latin: cuneus) which form its signs. Cuneiform was originally developed to write the Sumerian language of southern [[Mesopotamia]] (modern Iraq). Along with Egyptian hieroglyphs, it is one of the earliest writing systems.
