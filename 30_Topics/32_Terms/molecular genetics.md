> Molecular genetics is a sub-field of [[biology]] that addresses how differences in the structures or expression of [[DNA]] molecules manifests as variation among organisms.  Molecular genetics often applies an "investigative approach" to determine the structure and/or function of genes in an organism's genome using genetic screens.  The field of study is based on the merging of several sub-fields in biology: classical Mendelian inheritance, [[cellular biology]], [[molecular biology]], [[biochemistry]], and [[biotechnology]]. Researchers search for [[mutations]] in a [[gene]] or induce mutations in a gene to link a gene sequence to a specific phenotype. Molecular genetics is a powerful methodology for linking mutations to genetic conditions that may aid the search for treatments/cures for various genetic diseases.
