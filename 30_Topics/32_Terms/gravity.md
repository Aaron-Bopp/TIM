#### <s class="topic-title">[[gravity]]</s>

Gravity (from Latin  gravitas 'weight'), or gravitation, is a natural phenomenon by which all things with [[mass]] or [[energy]]—including planets, stars, galaxies, and even light—are attracted to (or gravitate toward) one another.  On [[Earth]], gravity gives weight to physical objects, and the Moon's gravity causes the tides of the oceans. The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the Universe caused it to begin coalescing and forming stars and caused the stars to group together into galaxies, so gravity is responsible for many of the large-scale structures in the Universe. Gravity has an [[infinite]] range, although its effects become weaker as objects get farther away.

Gravity is most accurately described by the [[general relativity]] (proposed by Albert [[Einstein]] in 1915), which describes gravity not as a force, but as the curvature of spacetime, caused by the uneven distribution of mass, and causing masses to move along geodesic lines. The most extreme example of this curvature of spacetime is a black hole, from which nothing—not even light—can escape once past the [[Black holes]] [[event horizon]]. However, for most applications, gravity is well approximated by [[Newton]]'s law of [[universal gravitation]], which describes gravity as a force causing any two bodies to be attracted toward each other, with magnitude proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

Gravity is the weakest of the four fundamental interactions of [[physics]], approximately 1038 times weaker than the strong interaction, 1036 times weaker than the electromagnetic force and 1029 times weaker than the weak interaction. As a consequence, it has no significant influence at the level of subatomic particles. In contrast, it is the dominant interaction at the macroscopic scale, and is the cause of the formation, shape and trajectory (orbit) of astronomical bodies.

Current models of particle physics imply that the earliest instance of gravity in the Universe, possibly in the form of quantum gravity, supergravity or a gravitational singularity, along with ordinary space and time, developed during the [[Planck epoch]] (up to 10−43 seconds after the birth of the Universe), possibly from a primeval state, such as a false vacuum, quantum vacuum or virtual particle, in a currently unknown manner. Attempts to develop a theory of gravity consistent with quantum mechanics, a quantum gravity theory, which would allow gravity to be united in a common mathematical [[framework]] (a theory of everything) with the other three fundamental interactions of physics, are a current area of research.
