> [!wikipedia] [complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity)
> 
> Complexity characterises the behaviour of a system or model whose components interact in multiple ways and follow local rules.
> 
> The term is generally used to characterize something with many parts where those parts interact with each other in multiple ways, culminating in a higher order of [[emergence]] greater than the sum of its parts. The study of these complex linkages at various scales is the main goal of [[complex systems theory]].
