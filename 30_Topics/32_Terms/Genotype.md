**[Genotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype)**: The genetically defined chromosomal kareotype of an organism (XX, XY, [and all variants there of](https://twitter.com/sciencevet2/status/1035250518870900737?lang=en))

> The genotype of an organism is its complete set of genetic material. Genotype can also be used to refer to the [[alleles]] or variants an individual carries in a particular gene or genetic location. If both [[alleles]] are the same, the genotype is referred to as homozygous. If the alleles are different, the genotype is referred to as heterozygous.
> 
> Genotype contributes to [[phenotype]], the observable traits and characteristics in an individual or organism. The degree to which genotype affects phenotype depends on the trait. 
> Not all individuals with the same genotype look or act the same way because appearance and behavior are modified by environmental and growing conditions. Likewise, not all organisms that look alike necessarily have the same genotype.
