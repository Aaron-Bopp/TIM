> In:: the [[philosophy of mind]], 
> panpsychism is the view that the [[mind]] or a mindlike aspect is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of reality. It is also described as a theory that "the mind is a fundamental feature of the world which exists throughout the universe."  
> 
> In the 19th century, panpsychism was the default philosophy of mind in Western thought, but it saw a decline in the mid-20th century with the rise of [[logical positivism]]. Recent interest in the [[hard problem of consciousness]] and developments in the fields of [[neuroscience]], [[psychology]], and [[quantum physics]] have revived interest in panpsychism in the 21st century.
