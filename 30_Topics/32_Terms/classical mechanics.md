#### <s class="topic-title">[[classical mechanics]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical%20mechanics)
> 
> Classical mechanics is a physical theory describing the motion of macroscopic objects, from projectiles to parts of machinery, and astronomical objects, such as spacecraft, planets, stars, and galaxies. For objects governed by classical mechanics, if the present state is known, it is possible to predict how it will move in the future ([[determinism]]), and how it has moved in the past (reversibility).
> 
> The earliest development of classical mechanics is often referred to as Newtonian mechanics. It consists of the physical concepts based on foundational works of Sir Isaac [[Newton]], and the mathematical methods invented by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Joseph-Louis Lagrange, Leonhard [[Euler]], and other contemporaries, in the 17th century to describe the motion of bodies under the influence of a system of forces. 
> 
> Classical mechanics provides extremely accurate results when studying large objects that are not extremely massive and speeds not approaching the speed of light. When the objects being examined have about the size of an atom diameter, it becomes necessary to introduce the other major sub-field of mechanics: [[quantum mechanics]]. To describe velocities that are not small compared to the speed of light, [[special relativity]] is needed. In cases where objects become extremely massive, [[general relativity]] becomes applicable.
