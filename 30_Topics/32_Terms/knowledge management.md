# <s class="topic-title">[[knowledge management]]</s>

##### ^blurb

Knowledge management or personal knowledge management is an area of thought commonly associated
with:: [[networked thinking]], [[web of thought|webs of thought]], [[Zettelkasten]], [[second brain]], [[evergreen notes]],
and many other systems of [[note writing]].

Not yet widely recognized in [[science]] or academia,
the term knowledge management became more widely used during [[COVID-19]] lockdowns in 2020. #TO/DO/CITE 

Knowledge management is usually seen as a part of the tools that allow for [[bi-directional links]], templating, and use of a [[knowledge graph]], although these are not required as long as the software provides functionality beyond writing and reading text.
Examples of these tools would be [[Obsidian (software)|Obsidian]], [[Roam Research (software)|Roam Research]], [[Evernote]], [[Notion]], and others.

Those engaging in [[knowledge management]] are usually asking the questions, "What are the best apps for note taking?", "How do we learn more effectively?", "What is the best way store and access what we know?", and "How can technology be leveraged to assist in learning?"

Knowledge management is seen as a major concern for [[knowledge work]].

##### Discussion

[[My TIM]] discusses my system in more detail.
[[Evergreen notes]] and [[second brain]] are two popular paradigms that I take inspiration from, but within the knowledge management community many other systems are used, see [[note writing]].

[[Productivity]] and [[learning]] are two major concerns of people engaging in knowledge work, which associates it with other subjects in those spaces such as todo or productivity apps, [[spaced repetition]], [[Blooms taxonomy]] and more.
