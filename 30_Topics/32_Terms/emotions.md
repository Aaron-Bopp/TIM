> Emotions are psychological states brought on by neurophysiological changes, variously associated with thoughts, feelings, behavioural responses, and a degree of pleasure or displeasure. There is currently no scientific consensus on a definition. Emotions are often intertwined with mood, temperament, personality, disposition, or creativity. Research on emotion has increased over the past two decades with many fields contributing including [[psychology]], [[medicine]], [[history]], sociology of emotions, and [[computer science]]. The numerous theories that attempt to explain the origin, function and other aspects of emotions have fostered more intense research on this topic.

> From a mechanistic perspective, emotions can be defined as "a positive or negative experience that is associated with a particular pattern of physiological activity." The original role of emotions was to motivate adaptive behaviors that in the past would have contributed to the passing on of genes through survival, reproduction, and [[kin selection]]. In some theories, cognition is an important aspect of emotion. Other theories, however, claim that emotion is separate from and can precede cognition.
