##### <s class="topic-title">[[self-concept]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [self-concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-concept)
> 
> One's self-concept (also called self-construction, self-identity, self-perspective or self-structure) is a collection of beliefs about oneself. Generally, self-concept embodies the answer to the question "Who am I?". 
> 
> Self-concept is distinguishable from [[self-awareness]], which refers to the extent to which self-knowledge is defined, consistent, and currently applicable to one's attitudes and dispositions. Self-concept also differs from [[self-esteem]]: self-concept is a cognitive or descriptive component of one's self (e.g. "I am a fast runner"), while [[self-esteem]] is evaluative and opinionated (e.g. "I feel good about being a fast runner").
> 
> Self-concept is made up of one's [[self-schemas]], and interacts with [[self-esteem]], [[self-knowledge]], and the [[social self]] to form the self as a whole. It includes the past, present, and future selves, where future selves (or possible selves) represent individuals' ideas of what they might become, what they would like to become, or what they are afraid of becoming. Possible selves may function as incentives for certain [[behavior]].
> 
> The [[perception]] people have about their past or future selves relates to their perception of their current selves. The temporal self-appraisal theory argues that people have a tendency to maintain a positive self-evaluation by distancing themselves from their negative self and paying more attention to their positive one. In addition, people have a tendency to perceive the past self less favourably (e.g. "I'm better than I used to be") and the future self more positively (e.g. "I will be better than I am now").
