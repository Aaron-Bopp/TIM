> [!wikipedia] [inquiry based learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquiry-based%20learning)
> 
> Inquiry-based learning is a form of active [[learning]] that starts by posing questions, problems or scenarios. It contrasts with traditional [[education]], which generally relies on the teacher presenting facts and their own knowledge about the subject. Inquiry-based learning is often assisted by a facilitator rather than a lecturer. Inquirers will identify and research issues and questions to develop knowledge or solutions. Inquiry-based learning includes [[problem-based learning]], and is generally used in small scale investigations and projects, as well as [[research]]. The inquiry-based instruction is principally very closely related to the development and practice of [[thinking]] and [[problem solving]] skills.
