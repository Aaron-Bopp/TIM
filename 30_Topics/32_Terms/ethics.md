#### <s class="topic-title">[[ethics]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics)
> 
> Ethics or moral [[philosophy]] is a branch of philosophy that "involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong [[behavior]]". The field of ethics, along with aesthetics, concerns matters of value; these fields comprise the branch of philosophy called axiology.
> 
> Ethics seeks to resolve questions of human [[morality]] by defining concepts such as good and evil, right and wrong, virtue and vice, [[justice]] and crime. As a field of intellectual inquiry, moral philosophy is related to the fields of moral psychology, descriptive ethics, and value theory.
> 
> Three major areas of study within ethics recognized today are:
> 
> 1. Meta-ethics, concerning the theoretical meaning and reference of moral propositions, and how their truth values (if any) can be determined;
> 2. Normative ethics, concerning the practical means of determining a moral course of action;
> 3. Applied ethics, concerning what a person is obligated (or permitted) to do in a specific situation or a particular domain of action.
