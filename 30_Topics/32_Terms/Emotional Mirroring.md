#### <s class="topic-title">[[emotional mirroring]]</s> 

It can be as simple as repeating back and validating the patient's emotional state. The first step is to identify the emotional state based on what the patient is saying, and by the nonverbal cues that the patient is showing (facial expressions, gestures, and mannerisms).


> [!wikipedia] [mirroring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirroring)
> 
> Mirroring is the [[subconscious]] replication of another person's [[nonverbal]] signals. This concept takes place in everyday interactions and often goes unnoticed by both the person enacting the mirroring behaviors as well as the individual who is being mirrored. 
> 
> Mirroring is distinct from [[consciousness|conscious]] [[imitation]] under the premise that while the latter is a conscious, typically overt effort to copy another person, mirroring is unconsciously done during the act and often goes unnoticed.
> 
> The display of mirroring often begins as early as infancy, as babies begin to mimic individuals around them and establish connections with particular body movements. The ability to mimic another person's actions allows the infant to establish a sense of [[empathy]] and thus begin to understand another person's [[emotions]]. The infant continues to establish connections with other individual's emotions and subsequently mirror their movements.


Mirroing involves the activation of [[mirror neurons]]
