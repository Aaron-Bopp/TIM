This is the [[belief]] that reducing tax rates across the board will allow for more spending and investment and thus more job creation. While this is true for tax cuts on the lower class, who will spend any additional money in the [[economy]], it is not true for the tax cuts of the higher class which will hoard their wealth beyond reason.
