> Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in [[physics]] that provides a description of the physical properties of nature at the scale of [[atoms]] and [[subatomic particles]].: 1.1  It is the foundation of all quantum physics including [[quantum chemistry]], [[quantum field theory]], [[quantum technology]], and [[quantum information science]].
> 
> Classical physics, the collection of theories that existed before the advent of quantum mechanics, describes many aspects of nature at an ordinary (macroscopic) scale, but is not sufficient for describing them at small (atomic and subatomic) scales. Most theories in classical physics can be derived from quantum mechanics as an approximation valid at large (macroscopic) scale. Quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that energy, momentum, angular momentum, and other quantities of a bound system are restricted to discrete values (quantization), objects have characteristics of both particles and waves ([[wave–particle duality]]), and there are limits to how accurately the value of a physical quantity can be predicted prior to its measurement, given a complete set of initial conditions (the uncertainty principle).
