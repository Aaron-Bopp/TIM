#### <s class="topic-title">[[hypothalamus]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [hypothalamus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamus)
> 
> The hypothalamus is a portion of the [[brain]] that contains a number of small nuclei with a variety of functions. One of the most important functions of the hypothalamus is to link the [[nervous system]] to the [[endocrine system]] via the [[pituitary gland]]. The hypothalamus is located below the thalamus and is part of the [[limbic system]]. 
> 
> The hypothalamus is responsible for the regulation of certain metabolic processes and other activities of the [[ANS|Autonomic Nervous System]]. It synthesizes and secretes certain [[neurohormones]], called releasing [[hormones]] or hypothalamic hormones, and these in turn stimulate or inhibit the secretion of hormones from the pituitary gland. The hypothalamus controls body temperature, hunger, important aspects of parenting and attachment behaviours, thirst, fatigue, sleep, and circadian rhythms.
