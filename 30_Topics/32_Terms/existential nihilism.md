#### <s class="topic-title">[[existential nihilism]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [existential nihilism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential%20nihilism)
> 
> Existential nihilism is the philosophical theory that life has no intrinsic [[meaning]] or [[value]]. With respect to the [[universe]], existential nihilism suggests that a single human or even the entire human species is insignificant, without [[purpose]] and unlikely to change in the totality of existence. According to the theory, each individual is an isolated being born into the universe, barred from knowing 'why'. The inherent meaninglessness of life is largely explored in the philosophical school of [[existentialism]], where one can potentially create their own subjective 'meaning' or 'purpose'. Of all types of [[nihilism]], existential nihilism has received the most literary and philosophical attention.
