Widely discussed in [[books_Darwin's Cathedral#THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM OF SOCIAL LIFE|Darwin's Cathedral]], this is a problem that hits to the core of [[Evolution]] when you apply the selfish rules of [[individual selection]] to organized social groups.
In order to solve this you need to apply the rules of [[natural selection]] to groups as well as individuals.
While this was the conclusion Darwin came to, 
later developments in the realm of [[molecular genetics]] caused many to only look at individuals and that [[group selection]] was too weak of a force to be considered.
^[This was not only the fault of [[molecular genetics]], and spawned just as much from the overuse of the now laughable idea of "for the good of the group" [[books_Darwin's Cathedral#^288296632]]]
This lead to long held beliefs that seemingly altruistic behaviors must be hiddenly selfish.
While this can often be true, it nor the ideas of [[kin selection]], [[reciprocal altruism]], or [[inclusive fitness]] were full explanations.

The answer is largely three fold, 
first you must understand and properly apply the rules of [[group selection]],
then you must understand that
[[Moral social control promotes pro-social behavior in groups]]
which leads to
[[Functionally integrated social groups become organisms in their own right]]
and finally that
[[Individual selection is an emergent mechanic of group selection]].
