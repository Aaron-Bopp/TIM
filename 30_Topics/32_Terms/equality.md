#### <s class="topic-title">[[equality]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political%20egalitarianism)
> 
> Political equality is the quality of a [[society]] whose members are of equal standing in terms of political power or influence. A founding principle of various forms of [[democracy]], political egalitarianism was an idea which was supported by Thomas Jefferson and it is a concept similar to moral reciprocity and legal equality. The idea suggests all citizens of a certain country must be treated equally solely depending on their citizenship status, not on their race, religion and how clever or how rich they are. Equal citizenship constitutes the core of political [[egalitarianism]]. This is expressed in such principles as one-person/one-vote, equality before the law, and equal rights of free speech.
