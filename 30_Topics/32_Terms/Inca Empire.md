#### <s class="topic-title">[[Inca Empire]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [Inca Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inca%20Empire)
> 
> The Inca Empire and at the time known as the Realm of the Four Parts, was the largest empire in [[pre-Columbian America]]. The administrative, political and military center of the empire was in the city of [[Cusco]]. The Inca civilization arose from the Peruvian highlands sometime in the early 13th century and lasted until Spanish [[colonization]] in the 16th century.
> 
> From 1438 to 1533, the Incas incorporated a large portion of western South America, centered on the Andean Mountains, using conquest and peaceful assimilation, among other methods. At its largest, the empire was a state comparable to the historical empires of Eurasia. 

> [!wikipedia]- Unique features of the Inca empire
>  
> The Inca Empire was unique in that it lacked many of the features associated with civilization in the Old World. Anthropologist [[Gordon McEwan]] wrote that the Incas were able to construct "one of the greatest imperial states in human [[history]]" without the use of the wheel, draft animals, knowledge of iron or steel, or even a system of writing. Notable features of the Inca Empire included its monumental architecture, especially stonework, extensive road network reaching all corners of the empire, finely-woven textiles, use of knotted strings ([[quipus|quipu]]) for record keeping and [[communication]], agricultural innovations and production in a difficult environment, and the organization and management fostered or imposed on its people and their labor.

> [!wikipedia]- Incan [[Economy]]
> 
> The Inca Empire functioned largely on the exchange of goods and services was based on reciprocity between individuals and among individuals, groups, and Inca rulers. "Taxes" consisted of a labour obligation of a person to the Empire. The Inca rulers (who theoretically owned all the means of production) reciprocated by granting access to land and goods and providing food and drink in celebratory feasts for their subjects. Many local forms of worship persisted in the empire, most of them concerning local sacred Huacas, but the Inca leadership encouraged the sun worship of Inti – their sun god – and imposed its sovereignty above other cults such as that of Pachamama. The Incas considered their king, the Sapa Inca, to be the "son of the sun."
