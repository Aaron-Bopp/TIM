> The initial singularity is a singularity predicted by some models of [[the Big Bang]] theory to have existed before the Big Bang and thought to have contained all the energy and spacetime of the Universe. The instant immediately following the initial singularity is part of the Planck epoch, the earliest period of time in the history of our [[universe]].
