> Problem-based [[learning]] (PBL) is a student-centered [[pedagogy]] in which students learn about a subject through the experience of solving an open-ended problem found in trigger material. The PBL process does not focus on [[problem solving]] with a defined solution, but it allows for the development of other desirable skills and attributes. This includes knowledge acquisition, enhanced group [[collaboration]] and [[communication]].
