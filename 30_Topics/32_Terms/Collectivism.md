> 
> Collectivism is a value that is characterized by emphasis on cohesiveness among individuals and prioritization of the group over the self. Individuals or groups that subscribe to a collectivist worldview tend to find common values and goals particularly salient and demonstrate greater orientation toward in-group than toward out-group. The term "in-group" is thought to be defined more diffusely for collectivist individuals to include societal units ranging from the nuclear family to a religious or racial/ethnic group. It's the opposite of individualism.
