> Information is processed,  organized and structured data. It provides context for data and enables decision making process. 
> The difference between information and data is that information resolves uncertainty. Data can represent redundant symbols, but approaches information through optimal data compression.
> 
> More technically, **information can be thought of as the resolution of uncertainty that manifests itself as patterns**; it answers the question of "What an entity is" and thus defines both its essence and the nature of its characteristics.
