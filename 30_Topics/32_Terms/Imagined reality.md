[[Imagined reality]] is explored in [[books_Sapiens|Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari]], as a mechanism by which [[Greater cooperation and communication has lead to the success of humans as a species]] but it is also the fundamental mechanism behind [[Belief pulls you forward into life]].

Of course you can opt out of the imagined reality at any time, some may even think of this as [[enlightenment]], but the effects that this imagined reality has on our lives are nearly unavoidable. These unavoidable effects are better thought of as the [[Imagined order]]
