A topic note is an order of magnitude larger than an [[evergreen notes|evergreen note]].
If an [[evergreen notes|evergreen note]] is a singular concept, then a topic note is a collection of related ideas.
A topic note should contain description or definition of what falls under that topic,
and an outline of various other notes (of any kind) that fall under it.
Maintaining topic notes is a valuable entry point into [[second brain]],
but focusing too much on creating and maintaing them can cause [[friction]]:
[[Prioritize organization over categorization to avoid cognitive bias]]

%%
Topic notes should be able to form naturally from your other notes so they should be titled however they would be naturally written. It should be titled as `Firstname Lastname`, `ACRONYM`, and as simply as possible i.e `[[second brain]]` instead of `The Second Brain`.  

A topic note can come to be in two ways:
1. In the creation of an outline for a topic I would like to writing about
2. Through repeated mentions in other notes
