#### <s class="topic-title">[[gravitational singularity]]</s>

A condition in which gravity is so intense that [[spacetime]] itself breaks down catastrophically.  As such, a singularity is by definition no longer part of the regular spacetime and cannot be determined by "where" or "when".

Trying to find a complete and precise definition of singularities in the theory of general relativity, the current best theory of [[gravity]], remains a difficult problem.  
Gravitational singularities are mainly considered in the context of [[general relativity]], where density apparently becomes [[infinite]] at the center of a black hole, and within astrophysics as the earliest state of the universe during [[the Big Bang]].

General relativity predicts that any object collapsing beyond a certain point would form a black hole, inside which a singularity (covered by an event horizon) would be formed. 

The initial state of the universe, at the beginning of the Big Bang, is also predicted by modern theories to have been a singularity which is referred to as the [[Initial singularity]].
