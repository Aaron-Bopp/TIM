#### <s class="topic-title">[[etymology]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [etymology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology)
> 
> Etymology is the study of the [[history]] of how words are written, and how their spelling and form changed. Etymologists make use of texts to gather knowledge about how words were used during earlier periods, how they developed in meaning and form, or when and how they entered the [[language]]. Etymologists also apply the methods of [[comparative linguistics]] to reconstruct information about forms that are too old for any direct information to be available.
> 
> By analyzing related languages with a technique known as the comparative method, linguists can make inferences about their shared parent language and its vocabulary. In this way, word roots in European languages, for example, can be traced all the way back to the origin of the [[Indo-European]] language family.
