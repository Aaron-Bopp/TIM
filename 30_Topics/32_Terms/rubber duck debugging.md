#### <s class="topic-title">[[rubber duck debugging]]</s>

Don't waste your coworkers time, just explain to a duck.

> [!wikipedia] [rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber%20duck%20debugging)

> Many programmers have had the experience of explaining a problem to someone else, possibly even to someone who knows nothing about [[programming]], and then hitting upon the solution in the process of explaining the problem. In describing what the code is supposed to do and observing what it actually does, any incongruity between these two becomes apparent. More generally, teaching a subject forces its evaluation from different perspectives and can provide a deeper understanding. By using an inanimate object, the programmer can try to accomplish this without having to interrupt anyone else. This approach has been taught in [[computer science]] and [[Software Development|software engineering]] courses.
