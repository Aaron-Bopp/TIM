#### <s class="topic-title">[[Hammurabi's code]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [Hammurabi's code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code%20of%20Hammurabi)
> 
> The Code of Hammurabi is a Babylonian legal text composed c. 1755–1750 BC. It is the longest, best-organized, and best-preserved legal text from the ancient Near East. It is written in the Old Babylonian dialect of Akkadian, purportedly by Hammurabi, sixth king of the First Dynasty of Babylon. The highest quality surviving copy of the Code is inscribed on a basalt or diorite stele 2.25 m (7 ft 4+1⁄2 in) tall, and is known as the "Hammurabi Louvre stele." 
> 
> Modern scholars responded to the Code with admiration, at its perceived fairness and respect for the rule of law, and at the complexity of Old Babylonian society. Debate among Assyriologists has since centred around several aspects of the Code: its purpose, its underlying principles, its language, and its relation to earlier and later law collections.
