#### <s class="topic-title">[[perception]]</s> 

the way in which something is regarded, understood, or interpreted. 

> [!wikipedia] [perception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception)
> 
> All perception involves signals that go through the [[nervous system]], which in turn result from physical or chemical stimulation of the [[sensory system]]. For example, vision involves light striking the retina of the eye; smell is mediated by odor molecules; and hearing involves pressure waves. 
> 
> Perception is not only the passive receipt of these signals, but it's also shaped by the recipient's [[learning]], [[memory]], expectation, and [[attention]]. Sensory input is a process that transforms this low-level information to higher-level information (e.g., extracts shapes for object recognition). The process that follows connects a person's concepts and expectations (or knowledge), restorative and selective mechanisms (such as attention) that influence perception.
