#### <s class="topic-title">[[policy]]</s>

Policy is the purview of [[Politics]], the side product of [[political strategy]], and the playtoy of [[political science]]

> [!wikipedia] [policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy)
> 
> Policy is a deliberate system of guidelines to guide decisions and achieve rational outcomes.
> 
> A policy is a statement of intent and is implemented as a procedure or protocol. 
> 
> Governments and other institutions have policies in the form of laws, regulations, procedures, administrative actions, incentive and voluntary practices.
> 
> The term may apply to government, public sector organizations and groups, as well as individuals, Presidential executive orders, corporate privacy policies, and parliamentary rules of order are all examples of policy.
> 
> Policy differs from rules or law. While the law can compel or prohibit behaviors (e.g. a law requiring the payment of taxes on income), policy merely guides actions toward those that are most likely to achieve the desired outcome.
> 
> Policy or policy study may also refer to the process of making important organizational decisions, including the identification of different alternatives such as programs or spending priorities, and choosing among them on the basis of the impact they will have.
> 
> Policies can be understood as political, managerial, financial, and administrative mechanisms arranged to reach explicit goals.
