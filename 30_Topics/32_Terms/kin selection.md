#### <s class="topic-title">[[kin selection]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [kin selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kin%20selection)
> 
> Kin selection is the [[Evolution|evolutionary]] strategy that favours the reproductive success of an organism's relatives, even at a cost to the organism's own survival and reproduction. Kin altruism can look like altruistic behaviour whose evolution is driven by kin selection. Kin selection is an instance of [[inclusive fitness]], which combines the number of offspring produced with the number an individual can ensure the production of by supporting others, such as siblings.
