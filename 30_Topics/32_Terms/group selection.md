##### <s class="topic-title">[[group selection]]</s>

> [!wikipedia:[group selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group%20selection)]

> Group selection is a proposed mechanism of [[evolution]] in which [[natural selection]] acts at the level of the group, instead of at the level of the individual or gene.

> Early authors such as V. C. Wynne-Edwards and Konrad Lorenz argued that the behavior of animals could affect their survival and reproduction as groups, speaking for instance of actions for the good of the species. In the 1930s, R.A. Fisher and J.B.S. Haldane proposed the concept of [[kin selection]], a form of altruism from the gene-centered view of evolution, arguing that animals should sacrifice for their relatives, and thereby implying that they should not sacrifice for non-relatives. From the mid 1960s, evolutionary biologists such as John Maynard Smith, W. D. Hamilton, George C. Williams, and Richard Dawkins argued that natural selection acted primarily at the level of the individual. They argued on the basis of mathematical models that individuals would not altruistically sacrifice fitness for the sake of a group. A consensus emerged that group selection did not occur. In 1994 [[David Sloan Wilson]] and Elliott Sober argued for multi-level selection, including group selection, on the grounds that groups, like individuals, could compete. In 2010 three authors including E. O. Wilson, known for his work on social insects especially ants, again revisited the arguments for group selection. They argued that group selection can occur when competition between two or more groups, some containing altruistic individuals who act cooperatively together, is more important for survival than competition between individuals within each group, provoking a strong rebuttal from a large group of ethologists.


The history of group selection is an interesting one, but our modern conception reflects ideas that have been around since the hypothesis of [[natural selection]].
![[books_Darwin's Cathedral#288296631q]]
What [[Charles Darwin]] talks about here would now be considered a form of [[Cultural Evolution]]. Indeed, [[group selection]] is often much more in the realm of cultural than genetic [[evolution]]. This makes discussions around group selection veer much more towards [[Psychology]] than [[biology]], but [[biology]] very much has a part to play in discussions of [[group selection]] and [[Cultural Evolution]]. The story of [[homo sapiens]] themselves is one of unique genetic evolution that was able to spread via [[group selection]].

[[Group selection]] is can be a very powerful force through it's reinforcement of [[reciprocal altruism]]. When group develops strong levels of cooperation while they are separated from the wider group 
^[much as [[homo sapiens]] was separated from [[homo erectus]] and [[homo neanderthalis]] in eastern Africa 150,000 years ago: [[Greater cooperation and communication has lead to the success of humans as a species]]]
it allows them to out compete another group. In the same species this leads the [[founder effect]] and in separate species in leads to extinction.
