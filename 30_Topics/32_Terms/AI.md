#### <s class="topic-title">[[AI]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial%20intelligence)
> 
> Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to natural intelligence displayed by animals including humans.
> 
> Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.
> 
> The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it".
> 
> This raises philosophical arguments about the [[mind]] and the [[ethics]] of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence. These issues have been explored by myth, fiction, and philosophy since antiquity. [[Science fiction]] and [[futurology]] have also suggested that, with its enormous potential and power, AI may become an existential risk to [[humanity]].
