#### <s class="topic-title">[[Holism]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [Holism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism)
> 
> Holism (from Greek ὅλος holos "all, whole, entire") is the idea that various systems (e.g. physical, biological, social) should be viewed as wholes, not merely as a collection of parts. The term "holism" was coined by Jan Smuts in his 1926 book Holism and Evolution.
