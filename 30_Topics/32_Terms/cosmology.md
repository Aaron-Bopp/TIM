> [!wikipedia] [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology)
> 
> Cosmology is a branch of [[metaphysics]] dealing with the nature of the [[universe]]. 
> 
> Physical cosmology is the study of the observable universe's origin, its large-scale structures and dynamics, and the ultimate fate of the universe, including the laws of science that govern these areas.
> Because of this shared scope with [[philosophy]], theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that cannot be tested.
