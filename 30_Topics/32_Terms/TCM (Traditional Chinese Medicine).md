#### <s class="topic-title">[[TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine)]]</s> 

Traditional Chinese [[medicine]] (TCM) is thousands of years old and has changed little over the centuries. Its basic concept is that a vital force of life, called [[Qi]], surges through the body. Any imbalance to Qi can cause disease and illness. This imbalance is most commonly thought to be caused by an alteration in the opposite and complementary forces that make up the Qi. These are called yin and yang.
