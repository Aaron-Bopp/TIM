#### <s class="topic-title">[[Amygdala]]</s>

A collection of cells near the base of the [[brain]]. There are two, one in each hemisphere or side of the brain. This is where [[emotions]] are given meaning, remembered, and attached to associations and responses to them (emotional memories).

> The amygdala is one of two almond-shaped clusters of nuclei located deep and medially within the [[temporal lobes]] of the brain's [[cerebrum]] in complex vertebrates, including humans. Shown to perform a primary role in the processing of [[memory]], [[decision making]], and emotional responses (including [[fear]], [[anxiety]], and [[aggression]]), the amygdalae are considered part of the [[limbic system]].
