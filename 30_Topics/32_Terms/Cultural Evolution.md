##### <s class="topic-title">[[Cultural Evolution]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [Cultural Evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural%20evolution)
> 
> Cultural evolution is an evolutionary theory of social change. It follows from the definition of [[culture]] as "[[information]] capable of affecting individuals' [[behavior]] that they acquire from other members of their species through teaching, [[imitation]] and other forms of social transmission". 
> 
> Today, cultural evolution has become the basis for a growing field of scientific research in the social sciences, including [[anthropology]], [[economy|economics]], [[psychology]] and organizational studies. Previously, it was believed that social change resulted from biological adaptations, but anthropologists now commonly accept that social changes arise in consequence of a combination of social, evolutionary and biological influences. 

In [[books_Darwin's Cathedral|Darwin's Cathedral]] [[David Sloan Wilson]] describes four insights into [[Cultural Evolution]] from [[group selection]].
1. Cultural evolution requires specialized genetic mechanisms to take place ^[[[books_Darwin's Cathedral#292936699q]]]
2. Many of these mechanisms are [[unconscious]] ^[[[books_Darwin's Cathedral#292936700q]]]
3. These mechanisms can be distributed among many individuals ^[[[books_Darwin's Cathedral#293875894q]]]
4. Cultural evolution takes place at the group level ^[[[books_Darwin's Cathedral#293875895q]]]

He concludes that [[Cultural evolution is not confined to the slow process of genetic evolution]]
