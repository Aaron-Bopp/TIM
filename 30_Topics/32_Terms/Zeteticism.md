#### <s class="topic-title">[[Zeteticism]]</s>

Based off the Greek word meaning "to seek",
this is an extreme form of [[empiricism]]

> Zététique (French: [zetetik]; from Ancient Greek: ζητητικός zētētikós, "inquisitive", "keen") is a French term (both a noun and an adjective) for the application of the scientific method when investigating allegedly "paranormal" phenomena. It is often seen as equivalent to, or somewhat different from, the term (scientific) skepticism (French: scepticisme (scientifique)), and is widely used in the modern skeptical movement in France for self-identification.

> [[Marcello Truzzi]] promoted the term "zeteticism" as an alternative to "[[skepticism]]", because he thought that the latter term was being usurped by what he termed "[[Pseudoskepticism|pseudoskeptics]]". A zetetic is a "skeptical seeker".

This is ironic as Zeteticism was already connected to [[Flat Earthers]] by [[Samuel Rowbotham]]
