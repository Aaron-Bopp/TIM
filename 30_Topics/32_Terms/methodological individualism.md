#### <s class="topic-title">[[methodological individualism]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [methodological individualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodological%20individualism)
> 
> In:: the [[social sciences]],
> methodological individualism is the principle that [[subjective]] individual [[motivation]] explains [[social behavior]], rather than class or group dynamics which are illusory or artificial and therefore cannot truly explain market or social phenomena. This concept was introduced as an assumption in the social sciences by [[Max Weber]], and discussed in his book Economy and Society.
> 
> Methodological individualism is often contrasted with [[methodological holism]] and [[methodological pluralism]].
