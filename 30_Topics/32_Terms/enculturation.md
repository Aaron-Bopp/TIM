#### <s class="topic-title">[[enculturation]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [enculturation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enculturation)
> 
> Enculturation is the process by which people learn the dynamics of their surrounding culture and acquire values and norms appropriate or necessary to that culture and its worldviews. 
> 
> The process of enculturation, most commonly discussed in the field of [[anthropology]], is closely related to [[socialization]], a concept central to the field of [[sociology]]. Both roughly describe the adaptation of an individual into social groups by absorbing the ideas, beliefs and practices surrounding them. 
> In some disciplines, socialization refers to the deliberate shaping of the individual. In others, the word may cover both deliberate and informal enculturation.
