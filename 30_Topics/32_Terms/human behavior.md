#### <s class="topic-title">[[human behavior]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [human behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%20behavior)
> 
> Human behavior is the potential and expressed capacity (mentally, physically, and socially) of human individuals or groups to respond to internal and external stimuli throughout their life. While specific traits of one's personality, temperament, and genetics may be more consistent, other behaviors change as one moves between life stages—i.e., from birth through adolescence, adulthood, and, for example, parenthood and retirement.
> 
> Behavior is also driven, in part, by thoughts and feelings, which provide insight into individual psyche, revealing such things as attitudes and values. Human behavior is shaped by psychological traits, as personality types vary from person to person, producing different actions and behavior. 
> 
> The behavior of humans (just as of other organisms) falls upon a spectrum, whereby some behaviors are common while others unusual, and some are acceptable while others beyond acceptable limits. The acceptability of behavior depends heavily upon [[social norms]] and is regulated by various means of [[social control]], partly due to the inherently conformist nature of human [[society]] in general. 
> 
> In sociology, behavior may broadly refer to all basic human actions, including those that possess no meaning—actions directed at no person. Behavior in this general sense should not be mistaken with social behavior. Social behavior, a subset of human behavior that accounts for actions directed at others, is concerned with the considerable influence of [[social interaction]] and [[culture]], as well as [[ethics]], social environment, authority, [[persuasion]], and [[coercion]].
