#### <s class="topic-title">[[Hierarchy of needs]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [Hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's%20hierarchy%20of%20needs)
> 
> Maslow's hierarchy of needs is an idea in psychology proposed by American Abraham Maslow in his 1943 paper "A Theory of Human Motivation" in the journal Psychological Review. 
> 
> Maslow subsequently extended the idea to include his observations of humans' innate curiosity. 
> 
> His theories parallel many other theories of human [[developmental psychology]], some of which focus on describing the stages of growth in humans. He then created a classification system which reflected the universal needs of [[society]] as its base and then proceeding to more acquired [[emotions]]. 
> 
> Some indigenous academics have speculated that his theories, including the hierarchy, may have been influenced by teachings and philosophy of the Blackfeet tribe, where he spent several weeks doing fieldwork in 1938.
> 
> The hierarchy of needs is split between deficiency needs and growth needs. While the theory is usually shown as a pyramid in illustrations, Maslow himself never created a pyramid to represent the hierarchy of needs.
> 
> This tool is utilized in many fields that involve working and taking care of people such as but not limited to: health care workers, educators, social workers, life skill coaches, and many more. Maslow's hierarchy pyramid is frequently used because it visualizes the needs that one must have met in order to reach [[self-actualization]]. 
> 
> The two key elements involved within this theory is the individual and the priority, which connects them to intrinsic behavioral motivation.
> 
> Maslow's hierarchy of needs is used to study how humans intrinsically partake in behavioral motivation. Maslow used the terms "physiological", "safety", "belonging and love", "social needs" or "esteem", and "self-actualization" to describe the pattern through which human motivations generally move. This means that in order for motivation to arise at the next stage, each stage must be satisfied within the individual themselves.
> 
> Additionally, this hierarchy is a main base in knowing how [[effort]] and [[motivation]] are correlated when discussing [[human behavior]]. Each of these individual levels contains a certain amount of internal sensation that must be met in order for an individual to complete their hierarchy. The goal in Maslow's hierarchy is to attain the fifth level or stage: self-actualization.
