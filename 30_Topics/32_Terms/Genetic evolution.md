#### <s class="topic-title">[[Genetic evolution]]</s>

Usually synonymous to [[Evolution]], it is mainly distinguished when discussing [[Cultural Evolution]].
While these are largely separate, they can interact through [[group selection]], where a group is promoted culturally because of a specific gene, or a gene is promoted because it is chosen in a certain group.

While [[Evolution]] was first observed through [[adaptation]] of traits through [[natural selection]], through an increased understanding of [[molecular genetics]] we know understanding that all adaptation is driven by mutations in genes.
