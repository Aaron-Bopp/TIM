> Emergence occurs when an entity is observed to have properties its parts do not have on their own, properties or behaviors which emerge only when the parts interact in a wider whole.
> 
> Emergence plays a central role in theories of integrative levels and of complex systems. For instance, the phenomenon of life as studied in biology is an emergent property of [[chemistry]], and many psychological phenomena are known to emerge from underlying neurobiological processes.

> In:: [[philosophy]],
> theories that emphasize emergent properties have been called emergentism.
