#### <s class="topic-title">[[working memory]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [working memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working%20memory)
> 
> Working memory is a cognitive system with a limited capacity that can hold [[information]] temporarily. Working memory is important for [[reasoning]] and the guidance of [[decision-making]] and [[behavior]]. 
> 
> Working memory is often used synonymously with [[short-term memory]], but some theorists consider the two forms of memory distinct, assuming that working memory allows for the manipulation of stored [[information]], whereas short-term memory only refers to the short-term storage of information. Working memory is a theoretical concept central to [[cognitive psychology]], [[neuropsychology]], and [[neuroscience]].
