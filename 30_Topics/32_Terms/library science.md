> Library science is an interdisciplinary field that applies itself to [[information]] management, [[information technology]], [[education]], and other areas to libraries; as well as the collection, organization, preservation, and dissemination of information resources; and the political economy of information. 
> 
> Historically, library science has also included archival science. This includes how information resources are organized to serve the needs of selected user groups, how people interact with classification systems and [[technology]], how [[information]] is acquired, evaluated and applied by people in and outside libraries as well as cross-culturally, how people are trained and educated for careers in libraries, the [[ethics]] that guide library service and organization, the legal status of libraries and information resources, and the applied science of computer technology used in documentation and records management.
