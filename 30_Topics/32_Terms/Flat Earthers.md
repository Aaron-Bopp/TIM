#### <s class="topic-title">[[Flat Earthers]]</s>

Referring to people who believe in a [[flat Earth]],
usually after the 20th century, long after the debate had been settled.
This belief is widely considered a [[conspiracy theory]].

> [!wikipedia] [Modern flat Earth beliefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern%20flat%20Earth%20beliefs)
> 
> Modern flat Earth beliefs are promoted by organizations and individuals which make claims that the [[Earth]] is flat while denying the Earth's sphericity, contrary to over two millennia of scientific consensus. Flat Earth beliefs are [[pseudoscience]]; the theories and assertions are not based on scientific knowledge. Flat Earth advocates are classified by experts in [[philosophy]] and [[physics]] as science deniers. 
> 
> Flat Earth groups of the modern era date from the middle of the 20th century; some adherents are serious and some are not. Those who are serious are often motivated by [[religion]] or conspiracy theories. Through the use of [[social media]], flat Earth theories have been increasingly espoused and promoted by individuals unaffiliated with larger groups. Many believers make use of social media to spread their views.
