#### <s class="topic-title">[[feng shui]]</s>

The [[philosophy]] of feng shui is a practice of arranging the pieces in living spaces in order to create [[balance]] with [[the natural world]]. The goal is to harness energy forces and establish [[harmony]] between an individual and their environment.

The Chinese words "feng" and "shui" translate to mean “wind” and “water," respectively. This concept derived from an ancient poem that talks about human life being connected and flowing with the environment around it.
