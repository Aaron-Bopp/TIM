Despite modern [[Conservatism|Conservatives]] insistence on the prescience of 
[[The Founding Fathers]], they acknowledged this, only claiming that all *men* are equal:
[[Most rights were denied to Americans at its founding]]
They would have claimed that this equivalency (and non-white and non-men's inequivalence) to be a result of the 'natural law'.
This [[natural law]] imbues so some sort of essence.
