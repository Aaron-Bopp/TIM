#### <s class="topic-title">[[prosocial behavior]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [prosocial behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosocial%20behavior)
> 
> Prosocial behavior, or intent to benefit others, is a social behavior that "benefit[s] other people or [[society]] as a whole", "such as helping, sharing, donating, co-operating, and volunteering". Obeying the rules and conforming to socially accepted behaviors are also regarded as prosocial behaviors. 
> 
> Evolutionary psychologists use theories such as [[kin selection]] theory and [[inclusive fitness]] as an explanation for why prosocial behavioral tendencies are passed down generationally. Encouraging prosocial behavior may also require decreasing or eliminating undesirable social behaviors ([[social control]]).
>
> These actions may be motivated by [[empathy]] and by concern about the welfare and rights of others, as well as for egoistic or practical concerns, such as one's social status or reputation, hope for direct or indirect reciprocity, or adherence to one's perceived system of fairness. It may also be motivated by altruism, though the existence of pure altruism is somewhat disputed, and some have argued that this falls into philosophical rather than psychological realm of debate.
