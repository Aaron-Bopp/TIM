#### <s class="topic-title">[[Hard problem of consciousness]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [Hard problem of consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard%20problem%20of%20consciousness)
> 
> The hard problem of [[consciousness]] is the problem of explaining why and how we have [[qualia]] or [[phenomenology|phenomenal experiences]]. 
> This is in contrast to the "easy problems" of explaining the physical systems that give us and other animals the ability to discriminate, integrate information, and so forth. These problems are seen as relatively easy because all that is required for their solution is to specify the mechanisms that perform such functions. 
> Philosopher David Chalmers writes that even once we have solved all such problems about the brain and experience, the hard problem will still persist.

#### Discussion

Acknowledgement of the hard problem immediately leads to a desire for a solution, such as [[Consciousness as the spark of life]].
If we will fail to explain the emergence of subjectivity from our [[wetware]], then science is no better than [[religion]].
