#### <s class="topic-title">[[inflation theory]]</s> 

> [!wikipedia] [inflation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation%20(cosmology))
> 
> In physical [[cosmology]], cosmic inflation, cosmological inflation, or just inflation, is a theory of exponential expansion of space in the early [[universe]]. The inflationary epoch lasted from 10−36 seconds after the conjectured [[Initial singularity]] to some time between 10−33 and 10−32 seconds after the singularity. Following the inflationary period, the universe continued to expand, but at a slower rate. The acceleration of this expansion due to [[dark energy]] began after the universe was already over 7.7 billion years old.
> 
> Many physicists also believe that inflation explains why the universe appears to be the same in all directions (isotropic), why the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] is distributed evenly, why the universe is flat, and why no magnetic monopoles have been observed.
