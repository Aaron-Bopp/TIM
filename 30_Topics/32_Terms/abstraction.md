#### <s class="topic-title">[[abstraction]]</s>

A way to remove complexity from a concept with the goal of allowing other concepts to be built upon it.

In:: [[Software Development]],
this is very commonly used. An example would using a package that completely handles the sending of a web request and returns you the result. This allows you to spend your time [[programming]] logic around the result and not having to waste time with complicated protocols. This kind of thing happens at all levels of software, from [[Binary]] being abstracted to [[Assembly]] being abstracted to [[C (programming language)|C]] being abstracted to [[Python]] being abstracted into various packages that allow us to create applications easily.

In:: [[learning]], 
abstraction is seen in things like the electron model in [[Chemistry]]. The math around how electrons actually work is very complicated, but the orbital model you learn in high school is good enough to let you understand most of how you will use Chemistry. Abstraction in this way is a 
form of:: [[scaffolding]]. It allows you to get the basics down so you can attack the higher level concepts later when you have more [[understanding]].

In:: [[knowledge management]],
this is seen in [[Conceptual notes vary in size and scope]] and [[Note titles should be abstractions of the note content]].
