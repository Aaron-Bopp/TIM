> Individualism is the moral stance, political philosophy, ideology and social outlook that emphasizes the intrinsic worth of the individual.  Individualists promote the exercise of one's goals and desires and to value [[independence]] and [[self-reliance]] and advocate that interests of the individual should achieve precedence over the state or a social group while opposing external interference upon one's own interests by society or institutions such as the government.
> 
> Individualism is often defined in contrast to [[totalitarianism]], [[collectivism]] and more corporate social forms.
