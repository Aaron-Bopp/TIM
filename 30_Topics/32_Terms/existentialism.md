#### <s class="topic-title">[[existentialism]]</s>

A [[philosophy]] built around our collective feeling of [[existential dread]] and it's origin's.

> [!wikipedia] [existentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism)
> 
> Existentialism is a form of philosophical inquiry that explores the problem of human existence and centers on the experience of thinking, feeling, and acting. 
> In the view of the existentialist, the individual's starting point has been called "the [[existential dread|existential angst]]", a sense of [[dread]], disorientation, [[confusion]], or [[anxiety]] in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world. Existentialist thinkers frequently explore issues related to the meaning, purpose, and value of human existence.
> 
> Many existentialists considered traditional systematic or academic philosophies, in style and content, to be too abstract and removed from concrete human experience. A primary virtue in existentialist thought is authenticity. Existentialism would influence many disciplines outside of [[philosophy]], including [[theology]], drama, [[art]], [[literature]], and [[psychology]].
