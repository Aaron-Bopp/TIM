#### <s class="topic-title">[[self-esteem]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [self-esteem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-esteem)
> 
> Self-esteem is an individual's subjective evaluation of their own worth. Self-esteem encompasses beliefs about oneself (for example, "I am unloved", "I am worthy") as well as emotional states, such as [[triumph]], [[despair]], [[pride]], and [[shame]].  Smith and Mackie (2007) defined it by saying "The [[self-concept]] is what we think about the self; self-esteem, is the positive or negative evaluations of the self, as in how we feel about it.
> 
> "Self-esteem is an attractive psychological construct because it predicts certain outcomes, such as academic achievement, [[happiness]], satisfaction in marriage and relationships, and criminal behavior. Self-esteem can apply to a specific attribute or globally. Psychologists usually regard self-esteem as an enduring personality characteristic (trait self-esteem), though normal, short-term variations (state self-esteem) also exist. Synonyms or near-synonyms of self-esteem include: [[self-worth]], [[self-regard]],  [[self-respect]], and [[self-integrity]]. 
> 
> It is a controversial term between academics due to some believing that the concept does not exist and is better measured by [[extraversion]] and [[introversion]] trait levels.
