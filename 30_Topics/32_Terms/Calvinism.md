#### <s class="topic-title">[[Calvinism]]</s>

In:: the history of [[religion]]

> [!wikipedia] [Calvinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism)
> 
> Calvinism is a major branch 
> of:: [[Protestantism]] 
> that follows the theological tradition and forms of Christian practice set down by [[John Calvin]] and other Reformation-era theologians. 
> 
> Calvinists broke from the Roman Catholic Church in the 16th century. Calvinists differ from Lutherans (another major branch of the Reformation) on the spiritual real presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper, theories of worship, the purpose and meaning of baptism, and the use of God's law for believers, among other points. 
> 
> The label Calvinism can be misleading, because the religious tradition it denotes has always been diverse, with a wide range of influences rather than a single founder; however, almost all of them drew heavily from the writings of Augustine of Hippo twelve hundred years prior.
