#### [[Algorithmic Learning]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

What if we could apply the same algorithms that make [[Youtube]] and [[Tiktok]] so addicting, and apply them to a base of educational content. 
Could this surpass traditional [[education]]?

Two major requirements would be:
1. An extremely large database of content that can be algorithmically parsed
2. A algorithm that can accurately serve content based on user preferences

- part of:: [[We will evolve when we make learning as easy as thinking]]
- because:: [[We learn by transforming information into understanding]]
- part of:: [[Friction is a hindrance to learning]]
