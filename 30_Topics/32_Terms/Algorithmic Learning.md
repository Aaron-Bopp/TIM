#### [[Algorithmic Learning]] 

What if we could apply the same algorithms that make [[Youtube]] and [[Tiktok]] so addicting, and apply them to a base of educational content. 
Could this surpass traditional [[education]]?

1. An extremely large database of content that can be algorithmically parsed
2. A algorithm that can accurately serve content based on user preferences
