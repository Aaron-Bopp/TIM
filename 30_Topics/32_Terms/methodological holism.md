#### <s class="topic-title">[[methodological holism]]</s>

Part of:: [[Holism]]

> [!wikipedia] [holism in science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holism%20in%20science)
> 
> [[Holism]] in science is an approach to research that emphasizes the study of [[Complex systems theory|complex systems]]. Systems are approached as coherent wholes whose component parts are best understood in context and in relation to one another and to the whole. 
> 
> This practice is in contrast to a purely analytic tradition (sometimes called [[reductionism]]) which aims to gain [[understanding]] of systems by dividing them into smaller composing elements and gaining understanding of the system through understanding their elemental properties. The holism-reductionism dichotomy is often evident in conflicting interpretations of experimental findings and in setting priorities for future research.
