#### <s class="topic-title">[[Age of Enlightenment]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [Age of Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age%20of%20Enlightenment)
> 
> The Age of Enlightenment was an intellectual and philosophical movement that dominated [[Europe]] in the 17th and 18th centuries with global influences and effects. The Enlightenment included a range of ideas centered on the value of human [[happiness]], the pursuit of [[knowledge]] obtained by means of [[reason]] and the evidence of the [[senses]], and ideals such as [[liberty]], [[progress]], [[toleration]], [[fraternity]], [[constitutional government]], and [[separation of church and state]].
> 
> The Enlightenment has its roots in a European intellectual and scholarly movement known as Renaissance humanism and was also preceded by the [[Scientific Revolution]] and the work of Francis Bacon, among others. Some date the beginning of the Enlightenment back to the publication of [[RenÃ© Descartes]]' Discourse on the Method in 1637, featuring his famous dictum, Cogito, ergo sum ("I think, therefore I am"). Others cite the publication of Isaac [[Newton]]'s Principia Mathematica (1687) as the culmination of the Scientific Revolution and the beginning of the Enlightenment. European historians traditionally date its beginning with the death of Louis XIV of France in 1715 and its end with the 1789 outbreak of the French Revolution. Many historians now date the end of the Enlightenment as the start of the 19th century, with the latest proposed year being the death of Immanuel Kant in 1804.
> 
> Philosophers and scientists of the period widely circulated their ideas through meetings at scientific academies, Masonic lodges, literary salons, coffeehouses and in printed books, journals, and pamphlets. The ideas of the Enlightenment undermined the authority of the [[monarchy]] and the [[Catholic Church]] and paved the way for the political revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries. A variety of 19th-century movements, including [[liberalism]], [[communism]], and [[neoclassicism]], trace their intellectual heritage to the Enlightenment.
