> 
> In [[physics]], the special theory of relativity, or special relativity for short, is a scientific theory regarding the relationship between space and time. In Albert [[Einstein]]'s original treatment, the theory is based on two postulates:
> 
> The laws of physics are invariant (that is, identical) in all inertial frames of reference (that is, frames of reference with no acceleration).
> 
> The speed of light in vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source or observer.
