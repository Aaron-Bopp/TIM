#### <s class="topic-title">[[Global workspace theory]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [Global workspace theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global%20workspace%20theory)
> 
> Global workspace theory (GWT) is a simple [[cognitive architecture]] that has been developed to account qualitatively for a large set of matched pairs of [[consciousness|conscious]] and [[unconscious]] processes.
> 
> GWT resembles the concept of [[working memory]], and is proposed to correspond to a "momentarily active, subjectively experienced" event in working memory (WM)â€”the "inner domain in which we can rehearse telephone numbers to ourselves or in which we carry on the narrative of our lives. It is usually thought to include inner speech and visual imagery." (in Baars, 1997).
> 
> Baars (1997) suggests that the global workspace "is closely related to conscious experience, though not identical to it." Conscious events may involve more necessary conditions, such as interacting with a "self" system, and an executive interpreter in the brain.

This understanding of [[consciousness]] is one that focuses on it's functional aspect. 
When an idea is in the global workspace, we are conscious of it.
We can do work in the global workspace, but we may be drawn away.

This relates [[consciousness]] more to [[attention]] than it does to [[experience]] and does not reflect on the [[subjective]] nature of consciousness or
