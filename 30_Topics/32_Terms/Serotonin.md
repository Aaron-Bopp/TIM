A [[Neurotransmitter]] and [[hormone]]. [[Serotonin]] produced in the brain helps regulate your attention, behavior, and body temperature. Other nerve cells in the body, primarily in your intestines, also produce serotonin which plays a role in regulating the [[digestive process]], [[blood flow]], and [[breathing]].
