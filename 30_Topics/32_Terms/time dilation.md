#### <s class="topic-title">[[time dilation]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [time dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time%20dilation)
> 
> In [[physics]] and [[general relativity]], time dilation is the difference in the elapsed time as measured by two clocks. It is either due to a relative velocity between them (special relativistic "kinetic" time dilation) or to a difference in gravitational potential between their locations (general relativistic gravitational time dilation). When unspecified, "time dilation" usually refers to the effect due to velocity.
> 
> After compensating for varying signal delays due to the changing distance between an observer and a moving clock (i.e. [[Doppler effect]]), the observer will measure the moving clock as ticking slower than a clock that is at rest in the observer's own reference frame. In addition, a clock that is close to a massive body (and which therefore is at lower gravitational potential) will record less elapsed time than a clock situated further from the said massive body (and which is at a higher gravitational potential).
