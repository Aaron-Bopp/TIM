#### <s class="topic-title">[[the Big Bang]]</s> 

The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological model explaining the existence of the observable universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale [[evolution]]. 

The basis of this theory is the observation that the farther away a galaxy is from us, the faster it is moving, leading to the idea of an [[expanding universe]].
Extrapolation of the expansion of the universe backwards in time using [[general relativity]] yields an infinite density and temperature at a finite time in the past.
This irregular behavior, known as the [[gravitational singularity]], indicates that general relativity is not an adequate description of the laws of physics in this regime. 

The initial discovery of [[Cosmic microwave background radiation]] in 1964 was key in the formulation of the Big Bang theory.
The model describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of high density and temperature, and offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, and large-scale structure.
