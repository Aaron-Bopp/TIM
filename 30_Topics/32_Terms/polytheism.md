#### <s class="topic-title">[[polytheism]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [polytheism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytheism)
> 
> Polytheism is the belief in multiple deities, which are usually assembled into a pantheon of gods and goddesses, along with their own religious sects and rituals.
> 
> Polytheism was the typical form of religion before the development and spread of the universalist Abrahamic religions of Christianity and Islam, which enforce monotheism. It is well documented throughout [[history]], from [[prehistory]] and the earliest records of Ancient Egyptian religion and Ancient Mesopotamian religion to the religions prevalent during Classical antiquity, such as ancient Greek religion and ancient Roman religion, and in ethnic religions such as Germanic, Slavic, and Baltic paganism and Native American religions.
> 
> Notable polytheistic religions practiced today include Taoism, Shenism or Chinese folk religion, Japanese Shinto, SanterÃ­a, most Traditional African religions, various neopagan faiths, and most forms of [[Hinduism]].
