#### <s class="topic-title">[[social order]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [social order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social%20order)
> 
> The term social order can be used in two senses: In the first sense, it refers to a particular system of social structures and institutions. Examples are the ancient, the feudal, and the capitalist social order. In the second sense, social order is contrasted to social chaos or disorder and refers to a stable state of [[society]] in which the existing social structure is accepted and maintained by its members. The problem of order or Hobbesian problem, which is central to much of sociology, political science and political philosophy, is the question of how and why it is that social orders exist at all.
>

[[John Green]] suggest to [[Use social order instead of society to better acknowledge hierarchy and inequality]].
