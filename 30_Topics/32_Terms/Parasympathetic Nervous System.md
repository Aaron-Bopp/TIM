Counterpart to the [[Sympathetic Nervous System]] in the [[ANS]]. Heavily involves the [[Vagus Nerve]]. 

> [!wikipedia] [Parasympathetic Nervous System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasympathetic%20nervous%20system)
> 
> The parasympathetic system is responsible for stimulation of "rest-and-digest" or "feed and breed" activities that occur when the body is at rest, especially after eating, including sexual arousal, salivation, lacrimation (tears), urination, digestion, and defecation. 
> 
> Nerve fibres of the parasympathetic nervous system arise from the [[central nervous system]]. Specific nerves include several cranial nerves, specifically the oculomotor nerve, facial nerve, glossopharyngeal nerve, and [[vagus nerve]].
