#### <s class="topic-title">[[topic notes]]</s> 

Topic notes come in many shapes and sizes.
Some topic notes are cover swaths of knowledge, and could be applied broadly as the main topics of evergreen notes, e.g. [[anxiety]], [[human experience]].
These topic notes are best used as jumping off points to organize your various ideas. 
These notes may lay dormant for a long time but as you build up knowledge around them you they can grow almost naturally.

Topic notes can also be focused, these are more similar to terms, but they can still have [[evergreen notes]] written about them.

Topic notes should be able to form naturally from your other notes so they should be titled however they would be naturally written. It should be titled as `Firstname Lastname`, `ACRONYM`, and as simply as possible i.e `[[second brain]]` instead of `The Second Brain`.  

A topic note can come to be in two ways:
1. In the creation of an outline for a topic I would like to writing about
2. Through repeated mentions in other notes
3. By adding brackets around an interesting term.
