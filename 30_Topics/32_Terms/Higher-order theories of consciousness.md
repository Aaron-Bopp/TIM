#### <s class="topic-title">[[Higher-order theories of consciousness]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [Higher-order theories of consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order%20theories%20of%20consciousness)
> 
> Higher-order theories of [[consciousness]] postulate that consciousness consists in [[perception]] or thoughts about first-order mental states. In particular, phenomenal consciousness is thought to be higher-order representation of perceptual or quasi-perceptual contents, such as visual images.
> 
> Higher-order theories are distinguished from other cognitive/representational accounts of consciousness which suggest that merely first-order mentality of certain sorts constitutes consciousness. 
^[Such as [[Global workspace theory]]]

This is most similar to [[Consciousness is our capacity to introspect]]
