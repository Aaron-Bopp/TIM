> In:: [[philosophy]], 
> physicalism is the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] thesis that "everything is physical", that there is "nothing over and above" the physical, or that everything supervenes on the physical. Physicalism is a form of ontological monism: a "one substance" view of the nature of reality.
> 
> Physicalism grew out of [[materialism]] with advancements of the physical sciences in explaining observed phenomena. The terms are often used interchangeably, although they are sometimes distinguished, for example on the basis of [[physics]] describing more than just matter (including energy and physical law).
> 
> According to a 2009 survey, physicalism is the majority view among philosophers, but there remains significant opposition to physicalism. Neuroplasticity has been used as an argument to support of a non-physicalist view. The philosophical zombie argument is another attempt to challenge physicalism.
