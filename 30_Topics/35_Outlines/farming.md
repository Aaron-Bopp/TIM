### The origins of farming

Many think that farming came as a unparalleled insight, and that once [[hunter-gatherers]] learned the secrets of farming they never turned back, but this is far from true. The transition between [[foraging]] and [[farming]] was nowhere near instant, and the ability to farm was not wholly new to foragers
^[[[books_Sapiens#^297301074]]]

Additionally, the decision to transition to farming was never really made. [[Farming outcompeted foraging by allowing for higher populations]], and [[Farming domesticated humans]]

The development and [[domestication]] of crops is one of the most remarkable things in human [[history]].

> [!wikipedia] History of farming
> 
> Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities. The history of agriculture began thousands of years ago. After gathering wild grains beginning at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers began to plant them around 11,500 years ago. Pigs, sheep, and cattle were domesticated over 10,000 years ago. Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world. 

### How farming changed the human psyche

[[The advent of farming lead to increased prevalence of anxiety]]
