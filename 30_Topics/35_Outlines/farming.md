### The origins of farming
Many think that farming came as a unparalled insight, and that once [[hunter-gatherers]] learned the secrets of farming they never turned back, but this is far from true. The transition between [[foraging]] and [[farming]] was nowhere near instant, and the ability to farm was not wholly new to foragers

Additionally, the decision to transition to farming was never really made. [[Farming outcompeted foraging by allowing for higher populations]], and [[Wheat domesticated humans]]
