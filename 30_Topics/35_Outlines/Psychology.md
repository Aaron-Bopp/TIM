> 
> Psychology is the scientific study of [[mind]] and [[behavior]]. Psychology includes the study of [[consciousness|conscious]] and [[unconscious]] phenomena, including [[feelings]] and [[thoughts]]. It is an academic discipline of immense scope, crossing the boundaries between the natural and social sciences. Psychologists seek an understanding of the emergent properties of brains, linking the discipline to [[neuroscience]]. 
>
> Psychologists are involved in research on [[perception]], [[cognition]], [[attention]], [[emotions]], intelligence, [[subjective]] experiences, [[motivation]], brain functioning, and [[personality]]. Psychologists' interests extend to [[interpersonal relationships]], psychological resilience, family resilience, and other areas within social psychology. They also consider the [[unconscious]] mind. Research psychologists employ empirical methods to infer causal and correlational relationships between psychosocial variables. Some, but not all, clinical and counseling psychologists rely on symbolic interpretation.
>
> While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of [[mental health]] problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in several spheres of human activity. 
> 
> By many accounts, psychology ultimately aims to benefit [[society]]. Many psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role, practicing in clinical, counseling, or school settings. Other psychologists conduct scientific research on a wide range of topics related to mental processes and behavior. Typically the latter group of psychologists work in academic settings (e.g., universities, medical schools, hospitals). Another group of psychologists is employed in industrial and organizational settings. Yet others are involved in work on [[developmental psychology|human development]], [[aging]], [[sports]], [[health]], [[forensics]], and the [[media]].
