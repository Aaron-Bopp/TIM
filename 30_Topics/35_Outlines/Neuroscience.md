> Neuroscience is the scientific study of the nervous system. It is a multidisciplinary science that combines [[physiology]], [[anatomy]], [[molecular biology]], [[developmental biology]], cytology, [[computer science]] and mathematical modeling to understand the fundamental and emergent properties of [[neurons]], glia and neural circuits. The understanding of the biological basis of learning, [[memory]], [[behavior]], [[perception]], and [[consciousness]] has been described by Eric Kandel as the "epic challenge" of the biological sciences. The scope of neuroscience has broadened over time to include different approaches used to study the [[nervous system]] at different scales. The techniques used by neuroscientists have expanded enormously, from molecular and cellular studies of individual neurons to imaging of sensory, motor and cognitive tasks in the brain.
