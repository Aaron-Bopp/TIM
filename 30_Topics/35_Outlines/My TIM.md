# <s class="topic-title">[[My TIM]]</s>

#### ^blurb

Since March 2021 I have become very interested in the [[knowledge management]] concept of a [[web of thought]] so intricate that it creates a [[second brain]]. In this quest I realized that my real purpose was to create a *[[TIM|Totally Integrated Machine]]*, where the purpose is not just to reflect my first brain, but to augment it.

**See**:: [[second brain]], [[note writing]]
*`$=customJS.dv_funcs.outlinedIn(dv, this)`*

#### Outline

- Where do we start?
	- [[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge]]
	- [[Your second brain should be an inspirational hub of creativity]]
	- [[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]]
	- Just use [[Obsidian (software)]]
		- [[Obsidian's graph is useful in the implicit and dynamic relations it can reveal]]
		- [[Use Obsidian tags as temporal classifiers]]
		- [[my TO(DO) and EVER(GREEN) structure]]
- What is the goal?
	- [[Nodes in the second brain are an abstraction of our first brain]]
	- [[Densely linked webs of thought provide intuitive access to knowledge]]
	- [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]]
	- Write all the time
		- [[When in doubt, write what you think]]
		- [[How to understand what you read]]
- How the hell do we do this?
	- Make everything accessible
		- [[Note structures should help curate knowledge]]
		- [[Organization systems are not mutually exclusive]]		
		- [[Curate source notes and definitions in your second brain to avoid junk text]]
	- Augment your brain power
		- [[Using spaced repetition for your conceptual notes]]
			- [[Use spaced repetition as a memory tool for your second brain]]
			- [[Use spaced repetition to weed your digital garden]]
		- [[A totally integrated machine should automate as much of the thinking process as possible]]
		-  [[A totally integrated machine should be infinitely scalable]]
	- Don't overburden yourself
		- [[Prioritize understanding over organization or categorization]]
		- [[Combine notes instead of deleting them to avoid ghost data in a second brain]]
- What are the hurdles?
	- [[The fragility of information in knowledge management]]
	- [[We are confined to the tools of our time]]
	- [[Nodes in the second brain are made up of impermanent data and permanent metadata]]
