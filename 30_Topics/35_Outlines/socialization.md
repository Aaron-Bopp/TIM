#### <s class="topic-title">[[socialization]]</s>

 the ways in which society conveys to the individual its expectations for their behavior
Social fitness is a big part of [[human survival]] and [[human advancement]]

> [!wikipedia] [socialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialization)
> 
> In [[sociology]], socialization is the process of internalizing the norms and ideologies of [[society]]. Socialization encompasses both [[learning]] and teaching and is thus "the means by which social and cultural continuity are attained".
> Socialization is strongly connected to [[developmental psychology]]. Humans need social experiences to learn their culture and to survive. 
> 
> Socialization essentially represents the whole process of learning throughout the life course and is a central influence on the [[behavior]], beliefs, and actions of adults as well as of children. 
> Socialization may lead to desirable outcomes—sometimes labeled "moral"—as regards the society where it occurs. Individual views are influenced by the society's consensus and usually tend toward what that society finds acceptable or "normal". Socialization provides only a partial explanation for human beliefs and behaviors, maintaining that agents are not blank slates predetermined by their environment; scientific research provides evidence that people are shaped by both social influences and genes. Genetic studies have shown that a person's environment interacts with their genotype to influence behavioral outcomes.
