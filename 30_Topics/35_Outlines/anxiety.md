a feeling of worry, nervousness, or unease about something with an uncertain outcome ^fc54c3

Your body's natural response to stress. It's a feeling of fear or apprehension about what's to come. The first day of school, going to a job interview, or giving a speech may cause most people to feel fearful and nervous.
