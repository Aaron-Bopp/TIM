#### <s class="topic-title">[[Sticky concepts]]</s>

A sticky concept is a simple but powerful concept that sticks ideas together,
^[[[Sticky concepts connect disparate ideas]]]
and thus stick in your [[brain]].
It is characterized by being a term that can apply to many different disciplines even if it is narrowly defined,
and by not being a thing you have consistently studied but continue to think about anyways.
