A [[stereotype threat]] is when a person is concerned a negative sterotype affecting their treatment in a situation. This can lead to lower performance and higher stress. There are two pyschological processes that underlie stereotype threat:
1. *Underperformance due to extra pressure*: The extra pressure of disproving a stereotype and avoid conflict leads to a lower [[working memory]]
2. *Underperformance due to threats of self-integrity and belonging*: If a person's [[self-worth]] or sense of belonging is threatened by a situation will protect themself by setting lower goals, withdrawing from the situation, or having less motivation. [^1]
