##### <s class="topic-title">[[Taoism]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [Taoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism)
> 
> Taoism or Daoism refers to either a school of [[philosophy|philosophical]] thought or to a [[religion]]; both share ideas and concepts of Chinese origin and emphasize living in harmony with the Tao (Chinese: 道; pinyin: Dào; lit. 'Way', 'Thoroughfare' or Dao). The Tao Te Ching, a book containing teachings attributed to Lao Tzu (老子; Lǎozǐ; Lao³ Tzŭ³), together with the later writings of Zhuangzi, are both widely considered the keystone works of Taoism.
> 
> In Taoism, the Tao is the source of everything and the ultimate principle underlying reality. Taoism teaches about the various disciplines for achieving perfection through [[self-cultivation]]. This can be done through the use of Taoist techniques and by becoming one with the unplanned rhythms of the all, called "the way" or "Tao". Taoist ethics vary depending on the particular school, but in general tend to emphasize wu wei (action without intention), naturalness, simplicity, spontaneity and the Three Treasures: 慈, [[compassion]], 儉, [[frugality]] and 不敢爲天下先, [[humility]].
> 
> Taoism has had a profound influence on Chinese culture in the course of the centuries and Taoists,  a title traditionally attributed only to the clergy and not to their lay followers, usually take care to note the distinction between their ritual tradition and the practices of Chinese folk religion and non-Taoist vernacular ritual orders, which are often mistakenly identified as pertaining to Taoism. Chinese alchemy (especially neidan), Chinese astrology, Chan [[Zen]] [[Buddhism]], several martial arts including kung fu, [[traditional Chinese medicine]], [[feng shui]] and many styles of [[Qi Gong]] have been intertwined with Taoism throughout history.
