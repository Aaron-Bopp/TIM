> [!wikipedia] [sympathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathy)
> 
> Sympathy is the [[perception]], [[understanding]], and [[reaction]] to the distress or need of another life form. 
> 
> According to David Hume, this sympathetic concern is driven by a switch in viewpoint from a personal perspective to the perspective of another group or individual who is in need. Hume explained that this is the case because "the minds of all men are similar in their feelings and operations" and that "the motion of one communicates itself to the rest" so that as affectations readily pass from one to another, they beget corresponding movements.
