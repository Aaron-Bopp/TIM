##### <s class="topic-title">[[human nature]]</s>

> [!wikipedia:[human nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%20nature)]
> 
> Human nature is a concept that denotes the fundamental dispositions and characteristics—including ways of thinking, feeling, and acting—that humans are said to have naturally.
> 
> Arguments about human nature have been a central focus of [[philosophy]] for centuries and the concept continues to provoke lively philosophical debate. While both concepts are distinct from one another, discussions regarding human nature are typically related to those regarding the comparative importance of genes and environment in human development (i.e., 'nature versus nurture'). Accordingly, the concept also continues to play a role in fields of science, such as [[genetics]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[anthropology]], [[neuroscience]], [[psychology]], and social science (such as [[sociology]]), in which various theorists claim to have yielded insight into human nature. Human nature is traditionally contrasted with human attributes that vary among societies, such as those associated with specific cultures.
