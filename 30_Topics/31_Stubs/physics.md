#### <s class="topic-title">[[physics]]</s> 

Physics is the natural science that studies matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion and behavior through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force. 

Advances in physics often enable advances in new technologies. For example, advances in the understanding of [[electromagnetism]], [[solid-state physics]], and [[nuclear physics]] led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.
