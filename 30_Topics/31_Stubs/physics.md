> [!wikipedia] [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics)
> 
> Physics is the natural science that studies matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion and behavior through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force. 
> 
> Advances in physics often enable advances in new technologies. For example, advances in the understanding of [[electromagnetism]], [[solid-state physics]], and [[nuclear physics]] led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons; advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.
