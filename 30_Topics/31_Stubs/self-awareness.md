> In:: [[philosophy]] of [[self]],
> self-awareness is the experience of one's own [[personality]] or individuality. It is not to be confused with [[consciousness]] in the sense of [[qualia]]. While consciousness is being aware of one's environment and body and lifestyle, self-awareness is the recognition of that awareness. Self-awareness is how an individual consciously knows and understands their own character, feelings, motives, and desires.
