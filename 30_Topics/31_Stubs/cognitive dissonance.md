From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive%20dissonance)

> In the field of [[Psychology]], cognitive dissonance is psychological stress people experience when they percieve contradictory information or when they participate in an action that goes against one of their core beliefs.

> According to this theory, when two actions or ideas are not psychologically consistent with each other, people do all in their power to change them until they become consistent.
> ^[[[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things]]]
> The discomfort is triggered by the person's belief clashing with new information perceived, wherein the individual tries to find a way to resolve the contradiction to reduce their discomfort. 
> ^[[[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]]]

> A person who experiences internal inconsistency tends to become psychologically uncomfortable and is motivated to reduce the cognitive dissonance.
>  They tend to make changes to justify the stressful behavior, either by adding new parts to the cognition causing the psychological dissonance (rationalization)
>  ^[[[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]]]
>  or by avoiding circumstances and contradictory information likely to increase the magnitude of the cognitive dissonance (confirmation bias).
> ^[[[Faith is an abstraction of cognitive dissonance]]]
 
>  Coping with the nuances of contradictory ideas or experiences is mentally stressful. It requires energy and effort to sit with those seemingly opposite things that all seem true. Festinger argued that some people would inevitably resolve dissonance by blindly believing whatever they wanted to believe.
