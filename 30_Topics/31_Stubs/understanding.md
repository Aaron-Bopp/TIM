> [!wikipedia] [understanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Understanding)
> 
> Understanding is a psychological process related to an abstract or physical object, such as a person, situation, or message whereby one is able to use concepts to model that object.
> 
> Understanding is a relation between the knower and an object of understanding. Understanding implies abilities and dispositions with respect to an object of [[knowledge]] that are sufficient to support intelligent behavior.
> 
> Understanding is often, though not always, related to [[learning]] concepts, and sometimes also the theory or theories associated with those concepts. However, a person may have a good ability to predict the [[behavior]] of an object, animal or system—and therefore may, in some sense, understand it—without necessarily being familiar with the concepts or theories associated with that object, animal, or system in their culture. They may have developed their own distinct concepts and theories, which may be equivalent, better or worse than the recognized standard concepts and theories of their culture. Thus, understanding is correlated with the ability to make inferences.
