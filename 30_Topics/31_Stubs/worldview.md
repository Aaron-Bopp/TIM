> 
> A worldview or world-view is the fundamental cognitive orientation of an [[individual]] or [[society]] encompassing the whole of the individual's or [[society]]'s knowledge and point of view.  A worldview can include natural [[philosophy]]; fundamental, existential, and normative postulates; or themes, values, [[emotions]], and [[ethics]].
> 
> Worldviews are often taken to operate at a [[consciousness|conscious]] level, directly accessible to articulation and discussion, as opposed to existing at a deeper, pre-conscious level.
