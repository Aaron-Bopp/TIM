> The concept of interpersonal relationship involves social associations, connections, or affiliations between two or more people. Interpersonal relationships vary in their degree of intimacy or self-disclosure, but also in their duration, in their reciprocity and in their power distribution, to name only a few dimensions. The context can vary from family or kinship relations, friendship, marriage, relations with associates, work, clubs, neighborhoods, and places of worship. Relationships may be regulated by law, custom, or mutual agreement, and form the basis of social groups and of society as a whole. Interpersonal relationships are created by people's interactions with one another in social situations.This association may be based on inference, love, solidarity, support, regular business interactions, or some other type of social connection or  commitment. Interpersonal relationships thrive through equitable and reciprocal compromise; they form in the context of social, cultural and other influences.

> The study of interpersonal relationships involves several branches of the social sciences, including such disciplines as communication studies, psychology, anthropology, social work, sociology, and mathematics.
> 
> The scientific study of relationships evolved during the 1990s and came to be referred to as "relationship science," after research done by Ellen Berscheid and Elaine Hatfield. This field of study distinguishes itself from anecdotal evidence or from pseudo-experts by basing conclusions on data and on objective analysis.
