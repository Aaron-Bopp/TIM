> [!wikipedia] [investment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment)
> 
> Investment is the dedication of an asset to attain an increase in value over a period of time. Investment requires a sacrifice of some present asset, such as time, money, or effort.
> 
> In [[finance]], the purpose of investing is to generate a return from the invested asset. The return may consist of a gain (profit) or a loss realized from the sale of a property or an investment, unrealized capital appreciation (or depreciation), or investment income such as dividends, interest, or rental income, or a combination of capital gain and income. The return may also include [[currency]] gains or losses due to changes in the foreign currency exchange rates.
> 
> Investors generally expect higher returns from riskier investments. When a low-risk investment is made, the return is also generally low. Similarly, high risk comes with a chance of high returns.
> 
> Investors, particularly novices, are often advised to diversify their portfolio. Diversification has the statistical effect of reducing overall risk.
