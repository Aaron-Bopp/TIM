#### <s class="topic-title">[[The Agricultural Revolution]]</s>

A widely used term for the transition from [[foraging]] to [[farming]] as the dominant mode of human life.

Recently it has been pointed out that this was less of a "revolution" and more of a gradual process where [[Farming outcompeted foraging by allowing for higher populations]].
Leading to the claim that really, [[Farming domesticated humans]].
