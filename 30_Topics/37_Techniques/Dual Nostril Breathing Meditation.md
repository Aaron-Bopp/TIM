#### [[Dual Nostril Breathing Meditation]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Examples:: https://youtu.be/sXGhT4pJcj8?t=7801
- Always switch on a full breath 
- When you meditate and drift off/lose focus what is the part of your mind that is pulling it back?
- The ability to observe is divine. It is not good or evil, it is that which notices everything else
- Catch the moment between inhalation and exhalation [^1]
	- What is the moment between inhalation and exhalation
		- where does it happen
		- what does it feel like
	- Catch that moment and observe it
		- "It's not about the answer it's about training yourself to look"
[[Meditation is a practice and discipline of observation]]
