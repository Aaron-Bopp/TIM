#### [[Flamingo Pose Meditation]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Examples:: https://youtu.be/UUC8qF5iDag?t=6195

- As you adopt the position your mind forces you into the present: you can't think about other things
- [[purpose]] is to make you focus on the present
    - when it becomes easy with eyes open close your eyes
- is based off of the principle of doing something that forces your mind to be in the present.
