#### [[How to process repressed emotions]] 

Repressed emotions are memories that store emotional energy and are generally inaccessible except when brought up by triggers.
[[Triggers activate stored emotional responses for certain situations]].
These situations usually have some similarity with the events that first caused the emotional response,
so it is usually difficult to address that repressed memory when it is triggered.
Unfortunately,
[[Our brain actively inhibits us from processing repressed emotions]] so it can also be hard to address that repressed memory at any other time.

Steps to address repressed emotions: ^[[[notes - Working with Samskaras]]]
1. [[How do we recognize our emotional triggers|Recognize when you get triggered]] 
2. [[How do we access repressed memories|Investigate what triggers you]]
3. Redevelop your emotional responses using [[self-love|self-care]]

Doing this is much easier said than done.
In general,
follow your [[emotions]] as best you can.
Emotional catharsis is often the first step in redeveloping your response, as just recognizing that something makes you emotional helps you unrepress that [[memory]].
^[This is why [[Avoidance IS the most-efficient way of dealing with emotion]] is **so** dangerous]

Methods of [[self-love|self-care]] will vary from person to person, but the important thing is to contrast the behavior that caused you to repress the memory.
For people with [[childhood trauma]] this usually means nurturing our inner child.
See [[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]] for more.
