#### [[Parsing markup text for Obsidian projects]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

When you are [[Converting existing file formats to plaintext]], you need to be considering the medium for which you are converting them.
If you are converting them to use in [[Obsidian (software)|Obsidian]], there are several considerations you will want to make.
While [[Obsidian (software)|Obsidian]] recognizes almost of all regularly used [[markdown]] syntax, and adds some of it's own, Obsidian is unique in that it has a system of plugins that extend it's functionality.
Additionally, if you are using Obsidian you will want to leverage it's [[knowledge graph]], and it's ability to easily create [[bi-directional links]]. 
This means that as you convert, you will want to be thinking about how you can divide the document into smaller pieces, how you will want to link those pieces together, and what metadata (tags, [[Dataview]] fields, etc.) you will want to attach to them.
