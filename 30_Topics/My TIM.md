Since March 2021 I have become very interested in the [[knowledge management]] concept of a [[web of thought]] so intricate that it creates a [[second brain]]. In this quest I realized that my real purpose was to create a *Totally Integrated Machine*, where the purpose is not just to reflect my first brain, but to augment it.

**See**:: [[second brain]], [[note writing]]
