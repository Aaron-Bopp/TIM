##### <s class="topic-title">[[sexual selection]]</s>

> [!wikipedia:[sexual selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual%20selection)]
> 
> Sexual selection is a mode of natural selection in which members of one biological sex choose mates of the other sex to mate with (intersexual selection), and compete with members of the same sex for access to members of the opposite sex (intrasexual selection). These two forms of selection mean that some individuals have greater [[reproductive success]] than others within a [[population]], for example because they are more attractive or prefer more attractive partners to produce offspring. Successful males benefit from frequent mating and monopolizing access to one or more fertile females. Females can have a limited number of offspring and maximize the return on the energy they invest in reproduction.
