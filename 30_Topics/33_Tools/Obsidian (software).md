# [[Obsidian (software)|Obsidian]]

**See**:: [[Zettelkasten]], [[second brain]], [[knowledge management]] 
*`$=customJS.dv_funcs.outlinedIn(dv, this)`*


## Getting Started
- Okay, I didn't scroll down past the download link on [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) until I had been using it for almost a year, but it is an excellent starting point!
- [Expansive list of resources and a weekly newsletter on Obsidian](https://obsidianroundup.org/resources/.)
- [List of resources](https://dynalist.io/d/CQ4V16tFhIJIfy-rgDK7r1Bp) for learning obsidian and [[knowledge management]]
 - [The Obsidian Hub](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/00+-+Start+here) is a community effort to collect resources
- Excellent beginner's guide to [Zettelkasten in Obsidian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6ySG7xYgjY)

### My notes that are useful to Obsidian users

## Built-ins

These are things that are built into obsidian:

- CodeJax

	- You can embed [[HTML]] directly into your notes which allows you to do things like have iframes display web content
