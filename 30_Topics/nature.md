> Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or [[universe]]. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of [[science]]. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.
