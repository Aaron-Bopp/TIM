Term notes are characterized by a list topics that cover than note. Term notes are not [[evergreen notes|evergreen]] in that they are not designed to develop over time. Once Einstein discovered **e = mc<sup>2</sup>** he didn't seek to redefine it, he started to build on it. Unfortunately I am not defining things as consistent as Einstein but nevertheless I am trying to define despite the fact that I know I will have to redefine so many things
