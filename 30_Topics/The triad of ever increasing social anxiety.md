#### [[The triad of ever increasing social anxiety]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[A secure identity is the best defense against social anxiety]] but you don't have a secure identity because => [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]] so you have no way of treating this anxiety which leads to [[social discomfort]] => which weakens your identity because [[Identity is your understanding of yourself vs your interaction with the world]] => which leads to a lack of secure identity, and the [[feedback loop]] repeats.

The only way out of this is loop is [[self-actualization]]

#TO/TEND/REFACTOR these notes [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]], [[Your insecurity is just more avenues for your anxiety to take advantage of]], [[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]]
