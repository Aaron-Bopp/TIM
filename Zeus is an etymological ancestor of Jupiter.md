#### [[Zeus is an etymological ancestor of Jupiter]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

We're all aware that Zeus in [[Greek mythology]] and Jupiter in [[Roman mythology]] are the diety, both the "God-father".

This is not just a decision made by some ancient Roman, it is a natural progression of [[Proto-Indo-European]] into [[Latin]].
