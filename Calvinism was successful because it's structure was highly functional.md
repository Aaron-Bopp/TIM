#### [[Calvinism was successful because it's structure was highly functional]]

This is an
example of:: [[Religion as a group level adaptation]] and is
explained by:: [[Religion promotes high social control]].

During:: the [[Reformation]],
[[Calvinism]] quickly showed itself to be an efficient organization of new ideas that could withstand the ire of the Catholic elite.
While this sect was often heralded as the success of one man, 
it's continued influence quickly and long after his death shows that there was something to this new ideology.

Thankfully, we have much record of [[Calvinism]]'s early days, and can use these records to study what made Calvinism so successful.
This approach is taken in [[Darwin's Cathedral by David Sloan Wilson]] from the perspective of [[Evolutionary Psychology]] or more specifically as an
example of:: [[Religion as a group level adaptation]].
This view tries to explain evolution through a functionalist perspective, looking at beliefs and catechisms as adaptations to the religious environment of the time,
and viewing the success of Calvinism as it's selection over other religious ideologies.

First lets look at the basics of [[What makes moral systems functional]]:
