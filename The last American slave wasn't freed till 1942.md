#### [[The last American slave wasn't freed till 1942]]

[[Most rights were denied to Americans at its founding]] is already hard for many to swallow, but most would be even more aghast to learn that chattel slavery did not end at the Emancipation Proclamation, the [[13th Ammendment]] or even Juneteenth.

Slavery was made illegal in the [[13th Amendment]],
but in practice [[black codes]], [[convict leasing]], and [[debt peonage]] continued to enslave black people long into the 20th century.

This was the case for [[Alfred Irving]]

explained by:: [[Slavery became much cheaper after the Civil War]]
