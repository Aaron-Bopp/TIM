> Based off of:: [[slave codes]],
> in:: [[U.S History]]
> the Black Codes, sometimes called Black Laws, were laws governing the conduct of African Americans (free and freed blacks). 
> The best known of them were passed in 1865 and 1866 by Southern states, after the American Civil War, in order to restrict African Americans' freedom, and to compel them to work for low wages.
> 
> Black Codes were part of a larger pattern of whites trying to maintain political dominance and suppress the freedmen, newly emancipated African-Americans. They were particularly concerned with controlling movement and labor of freedmen, as slavery had been replaced by a free labor system. Although freedmen had been emancipated, their lives were greatly restricted by the Black Codes. The defining feature of the Black Codes was broad [[vagrancy law]], which allowed local authorities to arrest freedpeople for minor infractions and commit them to involuntary labor. 
> This period was the start of [[convict leasing]].
