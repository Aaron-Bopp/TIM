#### [[Worlds views should be open ended and adaptive]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[The Christian worldview is incompatible with most other worldviews]] because [[Worldviews should not make life seem easy and simple]]. As the world continues to change and grow we see [[Christianity]] starting to clash with modern day perspective
^[[[The church will fail if christians keep aligning themselves with hate instead of love]]]
while [[eastern philosophy]] like [[meditation]], [[yoga]], and even [[Buddhism]] become more and more accepted in the west.
This is because these world views broke down [[humanity]] to it's core elements and so as we learn new information about the world we can see it fitting into these world views. 
^[[[notes_Science of Meditation]]]

Even if your [[worldview]] is open ended and adaptive, it does not always mean that you will be that way. [[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]], but this kind of [[worldview]] and consistent practice of [[meditation]] can help you separate from the irrationality of your [[ego]] and keep your [[self]] open to new ideas: [[Karma is an open ended system of belief]]

- [[Hard rules create cognitive bias]]
- [[The way systems work can create cognitive bias]]
- [[Use philosophies as far they are useful and nothing more]]
- [[Webs of thought provide heterarchical structure]]
