#### [[Theology preserves hierarchy through deific blessing]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[The caste system preserved hierarchy through purity]] is an example of this, as purity was both a physical reality and enforced by [[religion]].

This has included claiming that all are descended from Noah's son Ham, and that Noah's curse was passed on them causing them to be slaves.

Less obviously some creation stories will prescribe certain races to soil or mud depending on their place in the [[social order]].
