#### [[You need to take what you read out of context]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This
answers:: [[How to read to understand]],
in addition to::[[You need to teach yourself what you read]]

If you are not deconstructing and reconstructing what the author is telling you you are losing so much potential.
You can't just read a book and expect to make all the possible connections the first time through.
Author's should taking us on the best path through their conclusions,
but it's still only ONE PATH.
This means that
you are able to make connections they couldn't,
because you aren't having to make the connections they are making for you.
However, you aren't going to do this if you only try and understand the relationships they put out for you
You need to reconstruct their relationships so that you can understand the intricacies that they couldn't communicate so you can then make further connections.
