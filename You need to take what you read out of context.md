#### [[You need to take what you read out of context]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

answers:: [[How to read to understand]]

If you are not deconstructing and reconstructing what the author is telling you you are losing so much potential.
You can't just read a book an expect to make all the possible connections the first time through.
Author's are taking us on one path through their conclusions.
This is most likely a good path because 
they probably had many paths to choose from
but they are not you.
You are able to make connections they couldn't, 
because you aren't having to make the connections they are making for you.
However, you aren't going to do this if you only try and understand the relationships they put out for you
You need to reconstruct their relationships so that you can understand the intricacies that they couldn't communicate so you can then make further connections
