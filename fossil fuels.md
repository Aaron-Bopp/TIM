> [!wikipedia] [fossil fuels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil%20fuel)
> 
> A fossil fuel is a hydrocarbon-containing material formed underground from the remains of dead plants and animals that humans extract and burn as fuel. 
> 
> The main fossil fuels are coal, petroleum and natural gas, which humans extract through mining and drilling. 
> 
> Fossil fuels may be burnt to provide heat for use directly (e.g. for [[cooking]]), to power engines (such as internal combustion engines in motor vehicles), or to generate [[electricity]].

Fossil fuels emit [[greenhouse gases]] when used, which means that reducing our use if them is key 
in:: [[climate change]].
