#### [[The biblical Christian God is evil and does not deserve to be worshipped]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

> I can't believe that the [[The bible is god breathed|Bible is infallible]] because I **cannot understand how a loving being could commit genocide so freely and unashamedly**. I cannot reconcile a god who would intentionally create a being with the knowledge that they would sin (and create the tree to let them do it) and still condemn them to hell as if it were only on them.

It is hard to look at the god described in the bible and not think he is either maliciously evil, or blatantly selfish.
