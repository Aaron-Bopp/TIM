#### [[The biblical Christian God is evil and does not deserve to be worshipped]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

> I can't believe that the [[The bible is god breathed|Bible is infallible]] because I **cannot understand how a loving being could commit genocide so freely and unashamedly**. I cannot reconcile a god who would intentionally create a being with the [[knowledge]] that they would sin (and create the tree to let them do it) and still condemn them to hell as if it were only on them.

It is hard to look at the god described in the bible and not think he is either maliciously evil, or blatantly selfish.

This is 
part of:: [[The church will fail if christians keep aligning themselves with hate instead of love]]

A caveat of this is that most [[Christianity|Christian]]'s prioritize their relationship with Jesus as their primary axis of [[belief]]. This means that [[You can leave the church without loosing your faith]]. 
^[Whether this relationship is healthy is an important question because [[Christians struggle to feel empathy because they must believe that non-christians are going to hell]]. Can Christians break away from this behavior just by not believing in the the Old testament God? [[Are Jesus' teachings antithetical to the modern Christian church]] suggests yes]

This 
results in:: [[Fear of hell is baked into Christianity for vulnerable believers]]
because [[Religious concepts are often too powerful for a child's mind]].
Children are just the kind of vulnerable believers that will be affected by this.
The moral juxtaposition of being told that a god is all loving and seeing that god's world be so unjust is [[trauma]] inducing. 
This may be
why:: [[Christians struggle to feel empathy because they must believe that non-christians are going to hell]]
