#### [[The brain lodges emotional reactions in our unconscious memory]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

The [[Association Cortices]] are what make the attachments that we use to survive
^[[[Humans are a product of evolution]]]
but they do that by lodging [[emotions]] in our [[subconscious]] called [[Samskara]].
If those attachments are left unchecked it can lead to very bad things 
^[[[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]]
but [[meditation]] allows us to gain [[control]] over our [[subconscious]] and [[detachment]] from those [[emotions]].

[[Meditation helps us detach negative attachments]]
