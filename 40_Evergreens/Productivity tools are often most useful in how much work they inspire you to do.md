#### [[Productivity tools are often most useful in how much work they inspire you to do]] 

If one tool actually inspires you to work and another won't, that is the better tool for you, no matter the relative "efficiency" of the tools.
This does need a caveat that this doesn't mean you should just seek out tools that require more work, so you feel more productive, but
most people are not relying on the increase of [[productivity]] between one tool or another, they are debating whether they will do the work or not.

This is not just a matter of laziness either. 
I didn't take notes at all in school or college not because I was lazy or didn't want to learn about my subjects, but because it felt more useful to store things in my brain.
It wasn't until I found [[evergreen notes]] that I realized what a boon [[writing]] could be
and felt like the notes I was making were *actually useful*.
^[This is an 
example of:: [[Learning how systems work can be a gateway to creating thought]]]

part of:: [[Good friction causes the brain to engage]] and [[Your second brain should be an inspirational hub of creativity]]

[[Zettelkasten]] is often lauded as ultra-efficient productivity tool, but it's greatest power might have just been the work it inspired.
