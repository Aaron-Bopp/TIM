#### [[Densely linked webs of thought provide intuitive access to knowledge]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

You should be able to crawl a web of thought without using any [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] [[structure]]. The thoughts should be so interconnected that you can easily flow from one topic to another, and if you return to your starting point you can start a completely new path that will lead to new insights. 

This is the [[organization]] [[structure]] behind [[Andy Matuschak's Evergreen Notes]], and you can tell that he is fully committed to this because on his site there is no way to search, no table of contents, and no folder structure, just interlinked notes. [[Andy Matuschak]] talks about this topic here: [Evergreen notes should be densely linked](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2HUE4ABbQjUNjrNemvkTCsLa1LPDRuwh1tXC)

Part of the reason a [[web of thought]] is so powerful is because it matches the way our actual brain's work
^[[[Nodes in the second brain are an abstraction of our first brain]]]
Every thought exists in time and space only through it's connection to other thoughts. As we learn we make new connections, and as we forget we lose connections. In a [[second brain]] this creates [[The fragility of nodes in a second brain]], because [[Nodes in the second brain are made up of impermanent data and permanent metadata]]

For my own site I employ many different ways of [[organization]], 
^[[[How I outlined my brain (literally just use all of the organization techniques at once)]]]
with a [[web of thought]] being one of the primary ones. This makes sharing my site, and using my site a much more approachable and valuable process. 
[[Concepts are the fundamental unit of knowledge]], so I can easily share a relevant [[conceptual notes|conceptual note]] to almost any discussion, but thanks to [[bi-directional links]], that concept will be connected to some number of related thoughts that will be useful to the person reading them. Personally, I find this one of the most rewarding ways to consume information.

[[Obsidian (software)|Obsidian]]'s graph provides an interesting way to visualize webs of thought. It shows nodes based on how many links come from or to that node, and places the nodes in spaced based off their connections to other nodes. Through this you can see the thoughts interconnected to form ideas: [[Obsidian's graph is useful in the implicit and dynamic relations it can reveal]], 

##### Counter:: Intuitive does not mean easy or approachable

Because [[Andy Matuschak's Evergreen Notes]] are such a pure web of [[web of thought]], it is often very difficult to find the things that you are looking for as an outside viewers. Even for your own notes, the [[heterarchy|heterarchical]] structure of a web of thought may not be right for everyone.
Thankfully [[Organization systems are not mutually exclusive]], and many people have employed systems to help overlay [[hierarchy]] on top of a web of thought, without loosing value: [[Prioritize organization over categorization to avoid cognitive bias]]
