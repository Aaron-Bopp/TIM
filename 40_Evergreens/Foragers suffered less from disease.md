#### [[Foragers suffered less from disease]] 

Most diseases that we have to deal with today are spread to us by close contact with farm animals and other humans.
[[Hunter-gatherers]] didn't have to deal with this 
partially because [[Foraging allowed for a diverse diet]], 
but mainly just because [[Foraging kept populations down]].

This later 
results in:: [[Native Americans died in droves to European diseases]]

part of:: [[Foraging was a very sustainable lifestyle]]
