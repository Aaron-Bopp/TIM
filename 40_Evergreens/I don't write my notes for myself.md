#### [[I don't write my notes for myself]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

The act of writing a note is one of [[friction]] and [[Friction is a hindrance to learning]].
Often times, I can process something faster than I can type it out,
but if I don't type it out I may lose that insight in a few seconds, a few minutes, or a few days. 
This is why I have tried to make [[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge|my second brain frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge]], but it still doesn't justify making these notes.

The real reason I write these notes is for my future [[self]] and my past [[self]].

My future self because I trust that I will continue to want to learn, and that the world won't change so drastically that these notes will become irrelevant. I want to be able to look back in 10, 20, and 40 years and see a record of my [[progress]] in [[understanding]] the world.

Even more importantly I write my notes for my past [[self]], because they desperately needed a guide. They needed someone to lead them and help them understand why they mattered. They needed someone to reflect what they were seeing inside so they wouldn't be so scared of it. I may not be able to go back in time and help myself, but perhaps I can help somebody else like me:
[[Why representation in media is important]]

- [[Longform media lets you reach people where they are at, short form media lets you reach people where you are at]]
- [[Be the change you want to see in the world]]
