#### [[I don't write my notes for myself]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

I write my notes for future self and my past [[self]].
My future self because I trust that I will continue to want to learn, and that the world won't change so drastically that these notes will still be useful.

My past [[self]] because they desperately needed a guide. They needed someone to lead them and help them understand themselves. They needed someone to reflect what they were seeing inside that was so utterly vile. I may not be able to go back in time and help the, but perhaps I can help somebody else like me:
[[Why representation in media is important]]

- [[Longform media lets you reach people where they are at, short form media lets you reach people where you are at]]
- [[Be the change you want to see in the world]]
