#### [[I don't write my notes for myself]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

I write my notes for future self and my past [[self]].
My future self because I trust that I will continue to want to learn, and that the world won't change so drastically that these notes will still be useful.

My past self because they desperately needed a guide. They needed someone to lead them and help them understand themselves. They needed someone to reflect what they were seeing inside that was so utterly vile.
