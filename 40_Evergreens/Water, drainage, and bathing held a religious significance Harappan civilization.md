#### [[Water, drainage, and bathing held a religious significance Harappan civilization]]

Through our excavations of Harrapan ruins in the Indus River Valley, we can see that they were built with full sewer systems, and that houses often had built in toilets and showers.

> The great bath was built with bricks and tar for waterproofing and had a drainage system.

In addition, the Harrapan city of Mohenjo-Daro had a communal bath built in a separate and elevated area of the city. 
While there is little evidence of Harrapan [[religion]], ritual bathing would have been a likely use for this space.

Harrapan cities were clustered around rivers, and made use of water in many unique ways.
