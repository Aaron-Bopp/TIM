#### [[Deleting an Obsidian note can have unforeseen consequences]] 

When you create a note in a system like [[Obsidian (software)|Obsidian]], you aren't just creating a file on your computer, or writing out some text, you are creating a universally accessible node that can have as much power as you give it. The data of this node is impermanent, it can be deleted at the click of a button, but when it is integrated into a [[second brain]], deleting it can have unforeseen consequences.

Even if you delete the file, the links will still remain, and the connections can still be made on the graph. This can be used to your advantage, but it can also be detrimental. 
[[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge]],
so you should be [[mindfulness|mindful]] about what you store and how you store it in your second brain.

Additionally, when you delete a file, connections that may have existed will disappear, resulting in a loss of data larger than just the data in the file. Whether it be the way that note pulled nodes together on the graph, or the fact that it had a tag that could then be autocompleted, deleting a note will have effects outside its contents. 
This is 
why:: you should [[Combine notes instead of deleting them to avoid ghost data in a second brain]].

This is not unique to computerized brains. 
Have you ever 
had a word stuck on the tip of your tongue? 
Remembered everything about an event except 
what happened? 
Our brains are made up of 
connections through neurons, 
and even if the destination is gone, 
the connection can remain.
So in a way this is
part of:: [[A second brain should mirror how we think]].
