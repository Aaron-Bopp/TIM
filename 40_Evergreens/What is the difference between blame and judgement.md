#### [[What is the difference between blame and judgement]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

##### [[blame]]

[[You can't blame people for failing to rise above their circumstances]]

Blame is the act of censuring, holding responsible, making negative statements
about an individual or group that their actions or inaction are socially or morally irresponsible,
the opposite of praise.
When someone is morally responsible for doing something wrong, their action is blameworthy.
By contrast, when someone is morally responsible for doing something right, we may say that his or her action is praiseworthy.
There are other senses of praise and blame that are not ethically relevant. One may praise someone's good dress sense, and blame their own sense of style for their own dress sense.

#####  [[judgement]]

Judgement is also known as adjudication which means the evaluation of evidence to make a decision.  Judgement is also the ability to make considered decisions. 

The term has at least five distinct uses.  Aristotle suggested we think of the opposite of different uses of a term, if one exists, to help determine if the uses are really different.  Some opposites will be included here to help demonstrate their uses are really distinct:

- Informal – opinions expressed as facts.

- Informal and psychological – used in reference to the quality of cognitive faculties and adjudicational capabilities of particular individuals, typically called wisdom or discernment.  The opposites are foolishness or indiscretion.

- Formal - the mental act of affirming or denying one thing of another through comparison.  Judgements are communicated to others using agreed-upon terms in the form of words or algebraic symbols as meanings to form propositions relating the terms, and whose further asserted meanings "of relation" are interpreted by those trying to understand the judgement.

- Legal – used in the context of legal trial, to refer to a final finding, statement, or ruling, based on a considered weighing of evidence, called, "adjudication".  Opposites could be suspension or deferment of adjudication. See spelling note for further explanation.

- Religious – used in the concept of salvation to refer to the adjudication of God in determining Heaven or Hell for each and all human beings. God's assessment of a person's worth: a determination of "good" conveys great value while "evil" conveys worthlessness.

    - [[Worldviews are wrong if they make life seem easy and simple]]
    - [[My worldview is not about conversion it is about acceptance]]

- Personality judgment, a psychological phenomenon of a person forming opinions of other people.
    - [[Empathy does not dissallow judgment]]
