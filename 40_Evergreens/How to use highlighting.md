#### [[How to use highlighting]]

How you highlight depends on your purposes and how you plan to use your highlights.

Highlighting is effective because it makes you interact with the work more. 
Highlighting is the lowest form of work while reading. 
If you are going to engage more complicated strategies to work with a text (or are required to because of external factors such as needing to understand it for a class or it being very dense and having no material for priming or [[scaffolding]])
highlighting may be more of a hindrance than a help.
