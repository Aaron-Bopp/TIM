#### [[There has been a decrease in mental health not an increase in mental illness]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Many people are disturbed by the increase in diagnosis of [[Disorder]]'s like [[GAD|Generalized Anxiety Disorder]] and [[SAD|Social Anxiety Disorder]], but the amount of people with these disorders. 
Instead the increase in access to medical terminology and an increase in [[anxiety]] culturally has lead to more people recognizing and looking help for these symptoms.

What is the reason behind this?
- [[Social media]]
	- [[Increases in scrutiny lead to increases in anxiety]]
- [[material conditions]]
	- [[existential dread]]
	- [[You can't control what happens]]
	- [[Insecure material conditions increase cognitive load and reduce outcomes]]
	- [[Your anxiety is telling you everything that could go wrong, not what will go wrong]]
- [[Anxiety prevents us from living in the present]]
