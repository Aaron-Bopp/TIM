#### [[There has been a decrease in mental health not an increase in mental illness]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Many people are disturbed by the increase in diagnosis of [[disorder]]'s like [[GAD|Generalized Anxiety Disorder]] and [[SAD|Social Anxiety Disorder]], but the amount of people with these disorders likely has not changed. 
Instead the increase in access to medical terminology and an increase in [[anxiety]] culturally has lead to more people recognizing and looking help for these symptoms.
This doesn't mean that people experiencing these symptoms are over-blowing it, 
or that doctor's are over diagnosing,
but that there are now new stimuli that are producing these symptoms 
outside of previous driver's behind the disorders.

There are still people who have pure [[Neuroscience|neurological]] [[anxiety]], but there are now far more people who have
societally produced [[anxiety]] that is just as debilitating as [[Neuroscience|neurological]] anxiety.
This doesn't mean that there isn't a neurological element to this societally produced anxiety,
but that element is more of a predisposition and the actual driver of the symptoms is [[society]].

What is the reason behind this?
- [[Social media]]
	- [[Increases in scrutiny lead to increases in anxiety]]
- [[material conditions]]
	- [[existential dread]]
	- [[You can't control what happens]]
	- [[Insecure material conditions increase cognitive load and reduce outcomes]]
	- [[Your anxiety is telling you everything that could go wrong, not what will go wrong]]
- [[Anxiety prevents us from living in the present]]
