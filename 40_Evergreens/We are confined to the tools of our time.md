#### [[We are confined to the tools of our time]] 

This is true both in how we [[influence]] other's and how we make [[progress]].

Over the course of human [[history]], we have had to deal with various levels of violence, death, [[fear]] and much more.
One of the tools that has been the most reliable is religion:[[The materialistic view of religions examines why humans invented and clung to religion]]

##### In:: [[technology]]

This has been one of the major driver's in human [[history]].
From stone tools allowing us to extract bone marrow,
^[[[Cracking bones and eating the marrow may have been human's first niche]]]
to [[writing]] allowing our societies to increase in size and density,
^[[[Empires are born through conquest and maintained by bureaucracy]] and [[Human settlement allowed for social order to rapidly evolve]]]
to the [[internet]] allowing us to communicate on levels we never could have before,
^[[[The internet revolutionized communication of and access to information]]]
a large leap in technology has usually lead to large changes in human civilization.
On the flip side of each of those revolutions is a person who wasn't able to change the world because they didn't have the tools they needed,
and in our own future,
if we do not innovate solutions for [[climate change]],
the tools of our time will not confine us to massive amounts of [[suffering]].

##### In:: [[interpersonal relationships]]

[[Sometimes we can't grow until we change our environment]], and sometimes, the people that we want to grow are stuck too. 
This raises the question [[When should you forgive people who don't deserve it]],
but also [[How long should we wait for someone to accept us]].

> it’s funny how sometimes it really does take a decade to [[persuasion|persuade]] someone of something. 
> at that sort of timescale it’s not even about direct engagement so much as it is about just living your best life in accordance with your principles in a sustainable way, and waiting for them to encounter difficulties their [[worldview]] and context

##### In:: [[society]]

[[Hope is not optimism it is a practice for producing change]],
but [[hope]] doesn't guarantee change or even speed it up, 
it just helps us [[endurance|endure]] long enough to see change.
[[Growing up is being able to articulate the hope more than the hopelessness]]
