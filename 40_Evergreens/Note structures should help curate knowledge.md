#### [[Note structures should help curate knowledge]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

As you're writing, your note structures shouldn't be constricting your thought,
they should be encouraging it.
If a structure makes you stop and think, "Ugh, I have nothing to put here" it is introducing needless [[friction]],
but if it stops and makes you think, "oh right, I need to put this here" it is adding to your process.
This is why friction can be both a hinderance and boon to your [[knowledge work]]:
[[Friction is a hindrance to learning]]

Over time this structures will help [[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge|your second brain become frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge]], without introducing too much overhead.
because their loosely defined nature makes it easy for your brain to use them
[[Hard boundaries reduce opportunities for creativity]]

Examples:
The **Topics** field in all of my [[evergreen notes]]. This field started out with zero definition or expectation, but other time it developed into a place for me to put some of the larger topics that the note covers. There isn't anything concrete about this field, but I over time I am accumulating what are the largest topics in my vault.

This is a big part of how you [[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]] and how [[Your second brain should be an inspirational hub of creativity]]
