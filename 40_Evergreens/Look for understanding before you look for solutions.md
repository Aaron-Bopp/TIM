#### [[Look for understanding before you look for solutions]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Solutions oriented people are too often focused on sharing rather than listening,
and instead of actually engaging with the [[material conditions]] of the situation
and finding a common ground and productive solutions,
they never try to actually understand the other person's situation.

When communicating with people you don't know (such as through the [[internet]]) [[empathy]] is the first and most important thing you should convey. If you do not show a willingness to understand somebody's opinion, they will not give you the time of day. Looking for [[understanding]] first will also lead to better outcomes when trying to convince someone of your solution.

Understanding how to do this will heavily increase your ability to effectively communicate your position and convince the other person:

The reason people tend not to do this varies, but one is that they may be used to 
[[Searching for THE answer is dangerous|searching for THE answer]]
and so they aren't prepared to accept other ways of thinking.
