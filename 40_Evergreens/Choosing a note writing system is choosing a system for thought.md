#### [[Choosing a note writing system is choosing a system for thought]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Choosing a [[note writing]] system is not about finding the right [[software]] to write in,
^[For that see [The best note-taking app of 2021 | Capiche](https://capiche.com/e/best-note-taking-app-2021)]
it is about choosing [[systems for thought|a system for thought]]. What system you choose depends majorly on what you are trying to accomplish. Are a student or researcher trying to bring all of your knowledge together for new conclusion? Are you a professional trying to map and manage all of your clients and projects? Are you just trying to get a hold of your life and offload some of the mental effort of keeping track of everything? All of these are prestigious goals, and can benefit from a well organized [[note writing]] system. 

Unfortunately, we cannot dream up our perfect [[second brain]] and have it at our fingertips, because [[We are confined to the tools of our time]]. Creating a system that works for you can take a lot of work, but if you are committed to the process it can be highly rewarding in the end. 
Remember to [[Write your notes with a system not within a system]] and to [[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]]

So what are your primary concerns?

##### I want to connect and grow my thought
%% #TO/TEND/GRAFT %%
- [[Your second brain should be an inspirational hub of creativity]]
- [[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge]]
- [[Densely linked webs of thought provide intuitive access to knowledge]]
- [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]]

##### I want my notes to be infinitely scalable
%% #TO/TEND/GRAFT %%
- [[A totally integrated machine should be infinitely scalable]]
- [[Evergreen notes should be constantly integrating new knowledge]]
- [[Organization systems are not mutually exclusive]]
- [[Webs of thought provide heterarchical structure]]
- [[Nodes in the second brain are made up of impermanent data and permanent metadata]]

##### I need to know my notes are safe

[[Note storage is important because it defines how you access and retain knowledge]], but it is also important in terms of security and access. A lot of software will store your notes in proprietary databases, and struggle to scale. For this a system like [[Obsidian (software)|Obsidian]] is going to fit you best.

##### I need it to be really easy to take notes or else I won't do it 

I fall into this boat. Until I found a note system that suited my brain and a software that allowed to me to reduce [[friction]] I almost never took notes. This has lead to [[My TIM]], which combines the systems mentioned above.

%% #TO/TEND/GRAFT %%
- [[Friction is a hindrance to learning]]
- [[Nodes in the second brain are an abstraction of our first brain]]
- [[The fragility of nodes in a second brain]]
- [[A totally integrated machine should automate as much of the thinking process as possible]]
