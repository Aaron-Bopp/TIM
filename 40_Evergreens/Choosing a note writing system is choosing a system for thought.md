#### [[Choosing a note writing system is choosing a system for thought]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Choosing a note writing system is not about finding the right [[software]] to write in, it is about choosing [[systems for thought|a system for thought]].

- [[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]]
- [[second brain]]
	- [[Nodes in the second brain are an abstraction of our first brain]]
	- [[Nodes in the second brain are made up of impermanent data and permanent metadata]]
	- [[Your second brain should be an inspirational hub of creativity]]
	- [[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge]]
	- [[The fragility of nodes in a second brain]]

Unfortunately, we cannot dream up our perfect [[second brain]] and have it at our fingertips, because [[We are confined to the tools of our time]]. [[Note storage is important because it defines how you access and retain knowledge]], and so choosing this peice of software is integral to minimizing [[friction]] in your system: [[Friction is the number one hindrance to learning]]
