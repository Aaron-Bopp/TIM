#### [[Choosing a note writing system is choosing a system for thought]] 

Choosing a [[note writing]] system is not about finding the right [[software]] to write in,
^[For that see [The best note-taking app of 2021 | Capiche](https://capiche.com/e/best-note-taking-app-2021)]
it is about choosing [[systems for thought|a system for thought]]. What system you choose depends entirely on what you are trying to accomplish. Are you a student or researcher trying to bring all of your knowledge together for new conclusions? 
Are you a professional trying to map and manage all of your clients and projects? 
Are you just trying to get a hold of your life and offload some of the mental effort of keeping track of everything? 

All of these are prestigious goals, and can benefit from a well organized [[note writing]] system. 
Unfortunately, we cannot dream up our perfect [[second brain]] and have it at our fingertips. 
Creating a system that works for you can take a lot of work, but if you are committed to the process it can be highly rewarding in the end. 
Additionally,
[[Learning how systems work can be a gateway to creating thought]].
Learning about and creating a system may help you clarify what you are trying to do.

So what are your primary concerns?

##### I want to connect and grow my [[knowledge]]

This is the most common goal of people seeking out [[knowledge management|knowledge management systems]]. Thankfully, much of the community is centered around it, and you can draw from a number of systems to achieve this goal.

- The basics: [[Densely linked webs of thought provide intuitive access to knowledge]]
- A major step: [[Prioritize understanding over organization or categorization]]
- The goal: [[Your second brain should be an inspirational hub of creativity]]

##### I need to know my notes are safe

[[Note storage is important because it defines how you access and retain knowledge]], but it is also important in terms of security and access. A lot of software will store your notes in proprietary databases, and struggle to scale. For this a system like [[Obsidian (software)|Obsidian]] is going to fit you best.

##### I need it to be really easy to take notes or else I won't do it 

I fall into this boat. Until I found a note system that suited my brain and a software that allowed to me to reduce [[friction]] I almost never took notes.
This is why one of the main benefits of [[My TIM]] is that it inspires me to work. 
^[[[Productivity tools are often most useful in how much work they inspire you to do]]]

- The problem: [[Friction is a hindrance to learning]]
- An answer: [[A second brain should mirror how we think]]

##### What if I don't know what I need

Many people know that they want to learn better or understand more, but they don't know what exactly they would use a [[note writing]] system.
My best advice is to involve yourself in [[note writing]] communities like Obsidian's. These can be incredibly inspiring and educational about what you would want to do with your notes.
^[[[Communities are knowledge graphs]]]

For people like this, it is most important to [[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]]
