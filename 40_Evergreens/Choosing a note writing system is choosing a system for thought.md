#### [[Choosing a note writing system is choosing a system for thought]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Choosing a note writing system is not about finding the right [[software]] to write in,
^[[The best note-taking app of 2021 | Capiche](https://capiche.com/e/best-note-taking-app-2021)]
it is about choosing [[systems for thought|a system for thought]]: [[Note storage is important because it defines how you access and retain knowledge]]

In a second brain this means choosing a system that makes these true:
- [[Your second brain should be an inspirational hub of creativity]]
- [[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge]]

Unfortunately, we cannot dream up our perfect [[second brain]] and have it at our fingertips, because [[We are confined to the tools of our time]].
[[Note storage is important because it defines how you access and retain knowledge]], and so choosing this peice of software is integral to minimizing [[friction]] in your system: 
[[Friction is the number one hindrance to learning]]

For me, [[My TIM]] is the closest I have gotten so far to [[We will evolve when we make learning as easy as thinking|making learning as easy as thinking]]

	- [[Nodes in the second brain are made up of impermanent data and permanent metadata]]
