#### [[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

With a small [[fear]], we are often annoyed at it, but for a large one, while we may wish it wasn't there, we know what the lack of it will mean.
These large insecurities developed because 
[[Children make wide assumptions about the world]] 
and [[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]].
This is why things like bullying, our parents invalidation, and especially [[childhood]] [[trauma]] are so impactful on our adult lives.

#TO/WRITE anecdote

[[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]],
which includes setting up the [[ego]] as a [[defense-mechanisms|defense-mechanism]].
^[[[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]]]
Over time, we start to value that protection because we have so much stored up [[fear]] for those situations. 
This valuing is often not [[consciousness|conscious]], or the threat cannot be named easily, both because of the same process of [[rationalizations|rationalization]]:
[[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]]

[[An unfulfilled need for validation results in a fear of rejection]], and when we decide that that fear is protecting us, we refuse to accept further [[validation]]: [[A secure identity is the best defense against social anxiety]]

[[Sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion]] is an amalgamation of this and an unjust world. [^1] We are too scared to let go of our [[self-hate]], because we fear what being hopeful would mean we would have to do: 
[[Be the change you want to see in the world]]

[^1]: [[What is the cognitive effect of living in an unjust world]]
