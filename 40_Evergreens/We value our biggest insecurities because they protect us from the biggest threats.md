#### [[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

#TO/TEND/CONNECT [[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]]

These large insecurities developed because [[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]], and [[An unfulfilled need for validation results in a fear of rejection]]. Because of these factors we can value that protection because we have so much stored up ([[Samskara]]) fear for those situations. 

With a small fear, we are often annoyed at it but for a large one, while we may wish it wasn't there we know what the lack of it will mean.

This valuing is often not conscious, or the threat cannot be named easily both because of the same process of [[rationalization]].
