#### [[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

%% #TO/TEND/CONNECT [[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]]%%

These large insecurities developed because [[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]], and [[An unfulfilled need for validation results in a fear of rejection]]. Because of these factors we can value that protection because we have so much stored up ([[Samskara]]) fear for those situations. 

%% #TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH  [[Samskara]] more in depth %%
With a small fear, we are often annoyed at it, but for a large one, while we may wish it wasn't there, we know what the lack of it will mean. [[Sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion]] is an amalgamation of this and an unjust world. [^1] We are too scared to let go of our [[self-hate]], because we fear what being hopeful would mean we would have to do. [^2]

[^1]: [[What is the cognitive effect of living in an unjust world]]
[^2]: [[Hope is not optimism it is a practice for producing change]]

This valueing is often not [[conscious]], or the threat cannot be named easily, both because of the same process of [[rationalization]]: [[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]].

This is in direct contradiction to how [[Anxiety should be a tool at your disposal not an impedance to your life]]
