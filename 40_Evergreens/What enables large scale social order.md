#### [[What enables large scale social order]] 

part of:: [[What maintains our social order]]

[[Social order]] is a phenomena that springs up naturally out of [[social behavior]],
but maintaining [[social order]] on a scale larger than a hundred or so people is much more difficult.
^[[[There is a limit to the size of a group ordered purely by personal communication]]]

- from:: [[What is the link between evolution and social behavior]]
- involves:: [[What is the origin of social hierarchy]]

[[Yuval Noah Harari]] argues in his book [[Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari|Sapiens]] that our [[Social order is built off of a shared belief in an imagined reality]].

While the ability to exist in this imagined order has been there since our time as [[hunter-gatherers]],
it only came to govern our daily lives after [[The Agricultural Revolution]].
^[[[Hunter-gathers were capable of mass cooperation]], but we did not make this cooperation a part over our every day survival, preferring to stay in autonomous groups: [[There is a limit to the size of a group ordered purely by personal communication]]]

Two solutions are proposed by Harari, [[mythology]] and [[cooperation]].

He then cites [[Hammurabi's code]] and [[The Founding Fathers]] as examples. 
These were two revolutionary systems of social organization.
^[The first and the most recent]

[[Hammurabi's Code preserved hierarchy through deific justice]], engaging [[mythology]].
[[Most rights were denied to Americans at its founding]]

#### Other explanations

If the [[social order]] we are talking about is [[capitalism]] then the origin is assumed to be our cynical egotistic nature.
