#### [[True optimism is acknowledging the suffering of the world and defying it anyway]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Most see optimism as an [[ignorance|ignorant]] understanding of an unjust world, but this belief leads to the fallacy of [[Happiness is enlightenment and sadness is delusion]]. However, [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]]. True optimism is an evolution of hope. [[Hope is not optimism it is a practice for producing change]], and true optimism is the fulfillment of this mindset.

- [ ] #TO/TEND/DEOBFUSCATE [[True optimism is acknowledging the suffering of the world and defying it anyway]], [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]]

The best worldviews focus on producing this mindset e.g. [[Bhuddism outlines a path and practice to end suffering, but does not promise it]], and the worst are [[Worldviews are wrong if they make life seem easy and simple|worldviews that make life seems easy and simple]]
