#### [[True optimism is acknowledging the suffering of the world and defying it anyway]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

True optimism is an evolution of hope, because [[Hope is not optimism it is a practice for producing change]], and true optimism is the fulfillment of this mindset.

Most see optimism as an [[ignorance|ignorant]] understanding of an unjust world, but this belief leads to the fallacy of [[Sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion]] which is refuted by the fact [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]]. 

The best worldviews focus on producing this mindset e.g. [[Buddhism outlines a path and practice to end suffering, but does not promise it]], and the worst are [[Worldviews are wrong if they make life seem easy and simple|worldviews that make life seems easy and simple]]

- this is intrinsic to [[social justice]] #TO/TEND/GRAFT 
	- [[Transformative justice is the alternative to punitive justice]]
	- [[We are confined to the tools of our time]]
	- [[You can't blame people for failing to rise above their circumstances]]
	- [[Communities are support systems]]
	- [[Be the change you want to see in the world]]
