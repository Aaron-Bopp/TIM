#### [[Our understanding of gender begins at a very early age]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Children can tell the difference between male and female faces between bith and three months and develop a [[gender identity]] around 18 months to two years and [[gender constancy]] develops around 3-4. 

#TO/TEND/GRAFT [[Gender is a social construct]], how gender is formed [[Biology supports the validity of trans people]], [[Our authority figures curate and reinforce what we are allowed to imitate]], [[Gender segregation increases gendered play]]

While young children can discern gender at an early age that does not mean gender is not a social construct and in reality children are just as willing to accept [[gender non-conformity]] if it is taught instead of the [[gender binary]]. 
^[[[Gender has historically been non-binary]]]

This studied understanding of gender in children only reinforces the validity of [[transgender|trans]] children, and [[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]] shows why [[Trans children will repress their dysphoria if they have been effectively taught it is unacceptable]] because of such as the [[trauma]] of [[Parents need to model the ability to deal with emotion to their children| parents not respecting our gender identity]]. [[How can parent's best help their children]]
