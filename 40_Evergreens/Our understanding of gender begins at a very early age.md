#### [[Our understanding of gender begins at a very early age]] 

[[Gender is a social construct]], so our [[understanding]] of [[gender]] grows just as quickly as our [[understanding]] of [[human behavior]].
Children can tell the difference between male and female faces between birth and three months and develop a [[gender identity]] around 18 months to two years and [[gender constancy]] develops around 3-4. 

Our [[parents]] play a huge role in this because [[Our authority figures curate and reinforce what we are allowed to imitate]]. They are the ones that start and feed [[Social Learning Theory|social learning]] and [[Gender self-socialization model|gender self-socialization]]
^[Although there is evidence of a more genetic basis for [[gender]]: [[Gender segregation increases gendered play]]]

While young children can discern gender at an early age that does not mean gender is not a [[social construct]] and in reality children are just as willing to accept [[gender non-conformity]] if it is taught instead of the [[gender binary]]. 
^[This is further supported by [[Gender has historically been non-binary]]]
This studied understanding of gender in children only reinforces the validity of [[Transgender people|trans]] children.
Additionally, [[Biology supports the validity of trans people]].

%%#TO/PONDER/IDEA information from studies%%

- enables [[Trans children will repress their dysphoria if they have been effectively taught it is unacceptable]]
