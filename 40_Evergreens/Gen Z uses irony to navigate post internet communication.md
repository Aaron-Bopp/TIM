#### [[Gen Z uses irony to navigate post internet communication]] 

[[Gen Z]] has a knack for internet [[communication]] unlike any other generation. They easily slide in and out of [[irony]], latch onto and quickly let go of the current trends and inside jokes, and perceive subtlety with ease.
However, this new dialect is one created and used primarily on the [[internet]]. This shapes the way that it can be used.

The internet gives access to more supporters and more detractors. This means that the average person experiences far more [[scrutiny]] on the internet than off. 
^[This might be the link between the [[internet]], [[Increases in scrutiny lead to increases in anxiety]], and [[There has been a decrease in mental health not an increase in mental illness]]]
[[video - Aesop didn't know about Meta-Irony]] discusses the more negative aspects of this, and how it has lead to a rise in a more ambiguous form of [[irony]], [[meta-irony]].

This ambiguity has also lead to the more absurdist or "random xd" style of humor 
^[[[video - What makes gen z humor so interesting]]]

Meta-irony is used to obfuscate your true meaning, whether for humor or power.

This difficult to perceive humor has lead to a new level of comradery among [[Gen Z]].
Along with the increased [[communication]] abilities of the internet this has lead to [[perception]] of greater cohesiveness and could perhaps
lead to an increased aptitude for social change:
[[Communication provides the opportunity to shape other's perceptions]]
