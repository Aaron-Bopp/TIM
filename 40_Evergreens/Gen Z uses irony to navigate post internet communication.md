#### [[Gen Z uses irony to navigate post internet communication]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Gen Z]] has a knack for internet [[communication]] unlike any other generation. They easily slide in and out of irony, latch onto and quickly let go of the current trends and inside jokes, and perceive subtlety with ease.
However, all of this ease is related to the internet creating almost a new dialect of [[language]] that is shaped by landscape it is originating on.

While this shared language may be off putting to people who are not fluent in it, it also accompanied with a level of comradery. This may lead to [[Gen Z]]'s increased aptitude for social change:
[[Greater cooperation and communication has lead to the success of humans as a species]]

- [[Longform media lets you reach people where they are at, short form media lets you reach people where you are at]]
- [[The internet allows niche topics to flourish]]
