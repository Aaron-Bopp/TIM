#### [[An increase in self-love and self-respect may lead to a loss of function]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

> How many of you unmasked autistics and other ND folks on your way to healing and [[self-actualization]] hit a point where you dropped your [[shame]] and [[fear]]… and suddenly lost the ability to motivate yourself to do stuff?
> ...suffice to say there was a moment where I understood that the ten tons of shame I’d lugged around my whole life weren’t mine to carry, so I put them down.

> Until I realized that not even I can make me do anything, because my whole productivity engine had been driven by external motivation and consequence avoidance and I was no longer afraid...

> But time and slowness and time and patience and time and reflection and time and therapy have helped me to come to know who I am in the absence of that fear and shame.

Once you start realizing and respecting your own needs, you may realize that you need more [[support]] than you realized. 

Once you free yourself of [[guilt]] and [[shame]] it may appear that you lose [[motivation]]

> You can get it back with proper fostering of intrinsic motivation...If you disarm the fear and shame responses, you need to do it in tandem with building up self-belief. This is why I think coaching helps for a lot of people.
