#### [[How to understand the brain]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Neuroscience]] is the incredible complex science of understanding the ins and outs of our [[brain]]. Unfortunately the a full [[Neuroscience]] understanding of the brain is beyond most people understandings. Additionally throughout [[history]] we have developed other methods of understanding the brain, and have used those in [[Psychology]].
These models are not useless, and can be good scaffolding to help us understand the brain on a deeper level, eventually.
