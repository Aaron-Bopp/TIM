#### [[Does cognitive dissonance increase your capacity for endurance]] 

#TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH 
It feels like the people who are under the most pressure are often the ones who can put up with the most. This might be more related to the [[Hierarchy of needs]] than [[cognitive dissonance]]

[[Knowledge of an unjust world is painful]] and
[[The injustice of endurance|An expectation of endurance is abuse]], but these are views that I am only able to hold because of my place of privilege. 
Not only are most people expected to endure, they are required by their [[material conditions]] to do so.
^[This is why I find the idea of [[radical freedom]] to be so odd. Even the most simple of social situations we are bound to norms and expectations.]

This may be 
part of:: [[The materialistic view of religions examines why humans invented and clung to religion]]
as this could 
explain:: [[Faith is an abstraction of cognitive dissonance]].

This is also
part of:: [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]].
Even if the change we need to see feels unachievable, living with the [[cognitive dissonance]] of believing it will happen anyways is 
how:: you [[Be the change you want to see in the world]]

On the flip side,
[[You can't blame people for failing to rise above their circumstances]] because of this exact reason.
