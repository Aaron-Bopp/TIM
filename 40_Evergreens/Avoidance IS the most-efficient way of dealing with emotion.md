#### [[Avoidance IS the most-efficient way of dealing with emotion]] 

- explained by:: [[Our brain actively inhibits us from processing repressed emotions]]
- part of:: [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]]
%%
#TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH is there a relationship between this and [[PTSD]]
%%

This is because avoidance can be almost immediate, and is an instinctual response.
After [[fear]], avoidance is the first response that we learn as children, and if better [[coping-mechanisms]] are not learned can become our only [[coping-mechanisms]] later in life.
Avoidance can be enforced by the [[subconscious]] without our [[consciousness|conscious]] [[knowledge]] or [[consent]],
and if your [[subconscious]] has learned how to completely tune out [[emotions]], it will start to use it at will.
This can lead to a person feeling disconnected and out of control of their emotions, unable to feel certain emotions, or entirely [[dissociation|disassociated]].

One manifestation of this is our [[ego]], because this 
works with:: [[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]].
Rationalizing an emotion away without actually feeling it is avoidance.

Another manifestation is [[dissociation]] or [[self-repression]].
Another is a [[repressed]] [[identity]] which impacts your ability to understand and respond to your environment:
^[[[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]]]
[[A repressed self creates a mistrust of self-love and self-esteem]]

%%For me this was realized as being unable to understand why I was the way that I was, because my brain was repressing so many emotions and memories.%%
