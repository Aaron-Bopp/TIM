#### [[Avoidance IS the most-efficient way of dealing with emotion]] 

- explained by:: [[Our brain actively inhibits us from processing repressed emotions]]
- part of:: [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]]
%%
#TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH is there a relationship between this and [[PTSD]]
%%

%% #TO/TEND/WEED  %%
When experience a strong negative emotion,
avoidance can be almost immediate, and is an instinctual response.
After [[fear]], avoidance is the first response that we learn as children, and if better [[coping-mechanisms]] are not learned it can become our only coping-mechanism later in life.
Avoidance can be enforced by the [[subconscious]] without our [[consciousness|conscious]] [[knowledge]] or [[consent]],
and if your [[subconscious]] has learned how to completely tune out [[emotions]], it will start to use it at will.
This can lead to a person feeling disconnected and out of control of their emotions, unable to feel certain emotions, or entirely [[dissociation|disassociated]].

This can also result from being told that are [[emotions]] aren't acceptable,
which could mean that not just negative emotions, but all emotions could start being avoided.

One manifestation of this is our [[ego]], because this 
works with:: [[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]].
Rationalizing an emotion away without actually feeling it is avoidance.

Other manifestations are [[dissociation]] or [[self-repression]] and are often the result of highly hostile environments.
^[This is
displayed by:: [[Self-repression is the most natural response for trans people in strongly gendered environments]]]

%%For me this was realized as being unable to understand why I was the way that I was, because my brain was repressing so many emotions and memories.%%
