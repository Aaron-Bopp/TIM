#### [[Avoidance IS the most-efficient way of dealing with emotion]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]], and if our [[emotions]] are going to impact our ability to succeed
^[and thus be selected against: [[Humans are a product of evolution]]]
it is going to deal with those emotions as quickly as possible, but this does not mean it will affectively deal with those [[emotions]]:
[[Our brain actively inhibits us from processing repressed emotions]]

%%
#TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH is there a relationship between this and [[PTSD]]
%%

This is because avoidance can be almost immediate, and is an instinctual response.
^[[[Our brains are built around survival]]]
After fear, avoidance is the first response that we learn as children, and if better [[coping-mechanisms]] are not learned can become our only [[coping-mechanisms]] later in life.
^[[[Our brain actively inhibits us from processing repressed emotions]]]
Avoidance can be enforced by the [[subconscious]] without our [[conscious]] [[knowledge]] or [[consent]],
and if your [[subconscious]] has learned how to completely tune out emotions, it will start to use it at will.
This can lead to a person feeling disconnected and out of control of their emotions, unable to feel certain emotions, or entirely [[dissociation|disassociated]].

One manifestation of this is our ego, because [[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]]. Another is a [[repressed]] [[identity]] which impacts your ability to understand and respond to your environment:
^[[[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]]]
[[A repressed identity creates a mistrust of self-love and self-esteem]]

%%For me this was realized as being unable to understand why I was the way that I was, because my brain was repressing so many emotions and memories.%%
