#### [[Programming is a powerful tool and a dangerous toy]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

I have wasted so much time on a coding tasks because I either didn't comprehend the amount of work that would be required to actually get a result or did not spend time looking for existing alternatives. Is this really wasted time when the act of programming in itself can be a learning process depends on how you approach the project.
