#### [[Early hunting techniques lead to domesticating farm animals]] 

While [[hunter-gatherers]] didn't fully settle into a [[farming]] life till nearly 10,000 bc, they likely took part in intentional hunting practices that doubled as methods of [[domestication]].
This involves corralling wild animals into places that it would be easier to kill them,
prioritizing killing more aggressive animals first and letting more docile animals reproduce,
using fire to clear areas where hunting was easier.

#TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH information about how humans used fire and corralling to enhance their hunting abilities

contrasts:: [[Farming domesticated humans]] and [[Farming prevented a return to foraging for early humans]].
Human's seemed to have a much stronger hand in domesticating animals than plants.
