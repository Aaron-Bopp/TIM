#### [[Gender is both an intrinsic experience and an necessary expression]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Gender]] sets expectations for how we exist in the world, and it influences how we shape our habits to fit our society. We shape our mannerisms behaviors, communication, and expectations to [[conscious|consciously]] and [[subconscious|subconsciously]] fit our [[gender]] into our [[gender schema]], [[gender identity]], and [[society]]. While these are true for [[cis]] people, [^1] they are not as aware of this experience or expression of gender as [[transgender|trans]] people. 

[^1]:  [[Every person has an experience of gender]]

This is the best rebuff to, "but they're making it their whole [[personality]]" Of course they are! That's the whole point! The expression of their gender is neccesary for their [[self-love]] and that self-love is beautiful and attracts people to you. 

[[Presentation is the realization of our self-perception and identity is the realization of our self-image]] 

Unfortunately, [[Being cool and marketable isn't the same as having rights]]
