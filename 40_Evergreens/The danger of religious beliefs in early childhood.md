#### [[The danger of religious beliefs in early childhood]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Teaching children that their eternal fate is at stake is not healthy and leads to [[religious trauma]]: [[Fear of hell is baked into Christianity]]. It is instilled from a young age that you must submit yourself to this god in order to avoid hell. While religion teaches the feelings of an omnipotent god are more important than yours.
[[Negative influences are stronger than positive influences]] and especially as children this will stick with us. [^1]

[^1]: [[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]

[[Parents need to model the ability to deal with emotion to their children]],
but religious [[parents]] repeatedly teach their children that all of their problems can be solved in faith.
Because Christians have always had such a simple and obvious choice to avoid this damnation, [^2]
[[Christians struggle to feel empathy because they must believe that non-christians are going to hell]]

[^2]: [[Worldviews are wrong if they make life seem easy and simple]]
