#### [[The danger of religious beliefs in early childhood]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

 [[Worldviews are wrong if they make life seem easy and simple]], and in childhood that means [[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood|we make wide assumptions about the world]]. 

 Teaching children that their eternal fate is at stake is not healthy and leads to [[religious trauma]]: [[Fear of hell is baked into Christianity]]. It is instilled from a young age that you must submit yourself to this god in order to avoid hell. While religion teaches the feelings of an omnipotent god are more important than yours.
 
[[Parents need to model the ability to deal with emotion to their children]], but religious [[parents]] repeatedly teach their children that all of their problems can be solved in faith. This pushes reliance on god and makes it seem like the obvious choice: [[Worldviews are wrong if they make life seem easy and simple]].
