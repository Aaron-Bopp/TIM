#### [[How to store source notes and definitions in your vault without getting overwhelmed]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This is an intergral part of [[How to collect thought in a second brain without creating friction]].

I believe the difference lies in curating the information in your vault and controlling the way you can access that information. For me this process looks this this:
1. Import highlights that are relevant to my learning from what I read so that they are accessible through [[Obsidian (software)|]] search and I can return to the primary source easily.
	- This can be tedious on it's own. Use tools like that can do this automatically, e.g [[Readwise]]
2. Add definitions to term and topic notes so that they can be easily accessed with page preview.
	- The [[Dictionary (plugin, obsidian)|]] and [[Wikipedia (plugin, obsidian)|]] plugins can streamline this  #TO/DO/FIND link in obsidian hub
3. Absorb highlights and notes in the relevant [[evergreen notes]] by copying and qouting the text, but removing as much fat as possible.
4. When searches are performed they can be limited to only text within [[evergreen notes|evergreens]], [[topic note|topics]], or [[source notes|sources]] or some combination, making accessing information the priority.
