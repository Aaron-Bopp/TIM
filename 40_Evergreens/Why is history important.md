#### [[Why is history important]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

 
Our history shapes us into who we are, as humans, as families and as nations. If we lose sight of our past we lose sight of who we are. Our triumphs, our ancestors and most importantly our struggles define us.

Freedom is our greatest triumph, the idea all other triumphs rely on. We've fought countless wars for it, and millions have lost their lives in its pursuit. On it we have founded our government, our constitution, our courts. "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." With these words our forefathers defined this amazing liberty.

The stories of our ancestors inspire us. Their sacrifices provide for us. Their wisdom enlightens us. Many gave their lives and reputations for us. Washington, the great general; Jefferson, the expander; Lincoln, the emancipator: These men shaped our country into what we know as America. Franklin Delanor Roosevelt fought the bloodiest war in history, Martin Luther King Jr stood for his inalienable rights and changed the world while doing it\--without these people we would not be the same; the world would not be the same.

But the thing that shapes us more than anything is our struggles. Our nation has passed through many fires \-- the hardship of conquering a wild land and casting off an oppressive empire, nearly being ripped apart by civil war and coming to the brink of financial collapse. But every time we have come out better if not stronger.

In conclusion our history gives us hope \-- hope that we may learn from the past in order that have a better future.
