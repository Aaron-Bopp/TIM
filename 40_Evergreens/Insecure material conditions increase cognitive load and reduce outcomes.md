#### [[Insecure material conditions increase cognitive load and reduce outcomes]] 

[[Anxiety]] is a feeling of worry, nervousness, or unease about something with an uncertain outcome, so [[insecurity]] of any kind ([[food insecurity]], [[self-doubt]], etc) is going to increase it and result in a reduced ability to address your [[Hierarchy of needs]].

[[BIPOC]] and [[Queer people]] experience this at a higher rate because of the way they have been [[marginalization|marginalized]] by [[society]]. [[Minority stress]] and [[stereotype threat]] are examples of this. 

[[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do#Cause material insecurity]] talks about how this load can effect you [[subconscious|subconsciously]]. [[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things]], and this [[anxiety]] is an explanation of the [[injustice]] of your situation: [[The injustice of endurance]]
