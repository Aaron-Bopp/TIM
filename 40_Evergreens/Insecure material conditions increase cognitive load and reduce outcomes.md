#### [[Insecure material conditions increase cognitive load and reduce outcomes]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Anxiety is a feeling of worry, nervousness, or unease about something with an uncertain outcome, so insecurity of any kind ([[food insecurity]], [[self-doubt]], etc) is going to increase it and result in a reduced ability to address your [[Hierarchy of needs]].

[[BIPOC]] and [[Queer]] people experience this at a higher rate becaues of the way they have been [[marginalized]] by society. [[Minority stress]] and [[stereotype threat]] are examples of this.
