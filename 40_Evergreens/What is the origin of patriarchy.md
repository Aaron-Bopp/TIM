#### [[What is the origin of patriarchy]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

It is easy to acknowledge that [[Gender is a social construct]], but most find it much harder to admit that [[Sex is a social construct]].
This is because their are real physical differences between most men and most women, but the questions is how much of our [[behavior]] is a result of those differences and how much influences those differences.

The answer to this
includes:: [[There is no direct relation between physical strength and social power]].

- [[Patriarchy convinces young men that they can and should be oppressors]]
- [[What would a world without gender look like]]
- [[Every person has an experience of gender]]
- [[Biology supports the validity of trans people]]
- [[Gender has historically been non-binary]]
