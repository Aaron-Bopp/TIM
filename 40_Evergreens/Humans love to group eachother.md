#### [[Humans love to group eachother]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[There is a limit to the size of a group ordered purely by personal communication]]

This is a major reason [[Greater cooperation and communication has lead to the success of humans as a species]]

> ![[books_Darwin's Cathedral#293875904q]]

Possible mechanism behind [[racism]], [[homophobia]], [[partisanship]]
This could be seen as a result of [[kin selection]] but more likely [[group selection]]:
[[Moral social control promotes pro-social behavior in groups]]

This can be seen as a
result of:: [[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things]].
[[Oppressors invent reasoning for their oppression]], 
and grouping people lets you place them in the [[social hierarchy]].

[[Humans yearn for a tool with no blood on it]] means that we do try to justify our groupings.

If we can stop this behavior we can overcome our biases and make it easier to learn: [[We will evolve when we make learning as easy as thinking]]
