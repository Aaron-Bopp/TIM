#### [[Nodes in the second brain are an abstraction of our first brain]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

All thoughts are made up of the electrons connecting neurons. The path's between these neurons are strengthened through use and weakened by disuse, and through a [[web of thought]] create [[conscious|consciousness]]. The purpose of our [[second brain]] is to compliment and augment this process:
[[Densely linked webs of thought provide intuitive access to knowledge]]

##### Nodes in the second brain are more fragile than thoughts in the first brain

In our first brain there is no such thing as "fragility" there is only learning and forgetting, but in the second brain learning doesn't happen on it's own and forgetting is impossible:
[[Nodes in the second brain are made up of impermanent data and permanent metadata]]

The easiest way that we can surpass the first brain is *permanency.* Data can sit for 20 years on a hard drive and still be accessible, but unlike in our first brain, data will not grow over time:
[[The fragility of nodes in a second brain]]

Much of [[knowledge management]] is centered around how to handle these problems: [[A healthy second brain requires a surplus of entry points]]

##### Counter:: Nodes in the [[second brain]] are whatever you make of them

You shouldn't ever take anybody's word in the [[knowledge management|PKM]] [[community]] as law, because you should [[Write your notes with a system not within a system]]. [[Choosing a note writing system is choosing a system for thought]], but [[When in doubt, write what you think]].

- [[A totally integrated machine should be infinitely scalable]]
