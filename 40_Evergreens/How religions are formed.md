#### [[How religions are formed]]

Religions often claim to be a result of divine inspiration and providence, but [[anthropology]] tells a different story. 
Religions are formed in a variety of ways, including
collections of traditions slowly gathered and passed down over time,
beliefs laid out by one or a small group of individuals that reflect beliefs of the time.
