#### [[Working through trauma can involve of a lot of letting go]] 

For me, this note is at the intersection between 
[[Sometimes we can't grow until we change our environment]]
and 
[[Accepting responsibility is not only about your actions]]. 
We need to acknowledge the immense amount of work and responsibility that it can take to work through your [[trauma]]
and that it can result in both perceived and real losses.

[[Trauma]] becomes part of our very nature through the fact that 
[[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]].
Even though working through it may involve letting go of things that you thought you couldn't live without,
you are more than your [[trauma]]:
[[It's always worth it to work through trauma]].

This can also mean forgiving people who don't deserve it. [[When should you forgive people who don't deserve it]]

part of:: [[We are confined to the tools of our time# In self-actualization]]
