#### [[Working through trauma can involve of a lot of letting go]] 

[[Trauma]] becomes part of our very nature through the fact that 
[[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]].
Even though working through it may involve letting go of things that you thought you couldn't live without,
you are more than your [[trauma]]:
[[It's always worth it to work through trauma]].

This note is at the intersection between [[It's always worth it to work through trauma]], [[Fear cannot be a deterrent for deconstructing your faith]], and [[Accepting responsibility is not only about your actions]] for me personally. We need to acknowledge the immense of work that it can take to work through your [[trauma]], that can result in both perceived and real losses. #TO/PONDER/IDEA 

This can also mean forgiving people who don't deserve it. [[When should you forgive people who don't deserve it]]
