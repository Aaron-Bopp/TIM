[[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]].
Large parts of our [[personality]] and our [[inter-personal communication|inter-personal relationships]] are affected by [[trauma]] and so working through it can impact the way we interact the world.
Yet it remains true that [[There aren't any downsides to working through trauma]].
Even though working through it may involve letting go of things that you thought you couldn't live without, 
you are more than your [[trauma]],

This can also mean [[Accepting responsibility is not only about your actions|Accepting responsibility for moving past your trauma]], or forgiving people who don't deserve it. [[When should you forgive people who don't deserve it]]
