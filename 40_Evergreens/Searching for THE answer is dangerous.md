#### [[Searching for THE answer is dangerous]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

If you only search for **THE** answer to your question,
(the one that will mean you don't have to keep thinking about it),
you wall yourself off to better [[understanding]] 
and you lose sight of the actual point of [[education]]: [[Be the change you want to see in the world]]
^[[[Knowledge of the world is painful]], but [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]]]

The additional questions, or the lack of answers that stem from the question you're asking are important!

%%
#TO/TEND/MULCH 
You probably think you are looking for better [[understanding]],
but if you more interested in satisfying your [[cognitive dissonance]] or [[ignorance]] than actually [[learning]]
you going accept answers that are built off of logical fallacies. 
%%
[[You can't control what happens you can only control what you do]],
similarly you can control what answer you are going to find you can only control how you look for it.
Additionally, if you spend a long time looking for this answer you will [[subconscious|subconsciously]] be unwilling to accept criticism of that point when you try to communicate it to others.
^[[[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]]]
This is why you should [[Look for understanding before you look for solutions]].

[[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]], so ingraining a belief is much easier than removing it, especially when this belief is built in childhood.
^[[[Children make wide assumptions about the world]]]
This is why [[stereotype|stereotypes]] are so dangerous: [[Stereotyping has the psychological goal of comprehension and self-enhancement]], but once you have stereotyped something, you are less likely to accept new information about that thing.
