#### [[Searching for THE answer is dangerous]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

If you only ever search for answers to problem's, you lose sight of the actual point of [[education]]: to better understand the world. 
^[[[Knowledge of the world is painful]], but [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]]]
If you only search for THE answer to your question,
(the one that will mean you don't have to keep thinking about it),
you wall yourself off to better understanding that may come from finding out why that answer is wrong or needs to be built on.
Additionally, if you spend a long time looking for this answer you will [[subconscious|subconsciously]] be unwilling to accept criticism of that point.
^[[[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]]]
This is why you should [[Look for understanding before you look for solutions]].

[[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]], and [[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]], so ingraining a belief is much easier than removing it, especially when this belief is built in childhood.
^[[[The danger of religious beliefs in early childhood]]]
This is why [[Stereotype|stereotypes]] are so dangerous: [[Stereotyping has the pyschological goal of comprehension and self-enhancement]], but once you have steretyped something, you are less likely to accept new information about that thing.
