#### [[Searching for THE answer is dangerous]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

If you only search for **THE** answer to your question
(the one that will mean you don't have to keep thinking about it),
^[This is a natural response because [[Knowledge of an unjust world is painful]], but [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]]]
you wall yourself off to better [[understanding]] 
and you lose sight of the actual point of [[education]].
#TO/PONDER/IDEA  what is the the point of education? [[We learn by transforming information into understanding]]? breaking us out of presuppositions? answering our inherent wonder? [[Humans transfer their wonder into creativity]]?

The additional questions, or the lack of answers that stem from the question you're asking are important!
You are trying to look for better [[understanding]],
but if you more interested in satisfying your [[cognitive dissonance]] or [[ignorance]] 
you going accept answers that are built off of logical fallacies and and aren't open to new [[information]].

[[You can't control what happens]],
similarly you can control what answer you are going to find you can only control how you look for it.
If you spend a long time looking for this answer you will [[subconscious|subconsciously]] be unwilling to accept criticism of that point when you try to communicate it to others.
^[[[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]]]
This is why you should [[Look for understanding before you look for solutions]].

What is the root of this trait? 
- [[Worldviews should not make life seem easy and simple]] because they make us believe that there are simple answers to complex problems
- [[You will never be pushed to understand marginalization unless you are part of a marginalized group]] leads to you being unused to grappling with new perspectives

[[Humans are addicted to believing]], so ingraining a [[belief]] is much easier than removing it, especially when this [[belief]] is built in [[childhood]].
^[[[Children make wide assumptions about the world]]]
This is why [[stereotype|stereotypes]] are so dangerous.
[[Stereotyping has the psychological goal of comprehension and self-enhancement]],
but once you have [[stereotype|stereotyped]] something, you are less likely to accept new [[information]] about that thing.

One of the most common places you see this trait is in organized [[Christianity]].
From the Galileo to [[abortion]], [[Christianity]] has struggled to accept new perspectives and views, leading to their own demise.
^[[[The church will fail if christians keep aligning themselves with hate instead of love]]]
This is ironic because the origins of religion are built off of our need to [[Humans transfer their wonder into creativity|transfer our wonder into creativity]].
^[[[The materialistic view of religions examines why humans invented and clung to religion]]]
