#### [[Searching for THE answer is dangerous]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

If you only ever search for answers to problem's, you lose sight of the actual point of [[education]]: to better understand the world. 
^[[[Knowledge of the world is painful]], but [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]]]
If you only search for THE answer to your question,
(the one that will mean you don't have to keep thinking about it),
you wall yourself off to better understanding that may come from
the additional questions, or the lack of answers that stem from the question you're asking. %% #TO/TEND/WEED %%
You may think you are just looking for a satisfactory answer, but often answers that satisfy you are built off of logical fallacies. 
^[[[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things]]]
Additionally, if you spend a long time looking for this answer you will [[subconscious|subconsciously]] be unwilling to accept criticism of that point when you try to communicate it to others.
^[[[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]]]
This is why you should [[Look for understanding before you look for solutions]].

[[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]], so ingraining a belief is much easier than removing it, especially when this belief is built in childhood.
^[[[Children make wide assumptions about the world]]]
This is why [[Stereotype|stereotypes]] are so dangerous: [[Stereotyping has the pyschological goal of comprehension and self-enhancement]], but once you have steretyped something, you are less likely to accept new information about that thing.
