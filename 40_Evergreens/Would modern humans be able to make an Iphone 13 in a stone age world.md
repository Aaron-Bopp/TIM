#### [[Would modern humans be able to make an iPhone 13 in a stone age world]]

Thought experiment:
Modern humanity is transported back to a stone age earth and are all aware that if we can create a iPhone 13 we will be transported back to modern times.
What would happen? 

Depending on transportation stategy million of people would immediately die from being transported to a bad spot. Even if we place the caveat that people have to be transported to solid ground we would still have millions of people placed in dense jungles, swamps, deserts, tundras, and mountains that would be unable to find shelter before succumbing to their surroundings.
While people in places like Australia and the Americas would immediately be faced with massive and dangerous animals that are unknown to us,
the most immediate dangerous threat would be other humans.
Quickly would start to wonder where their next meal would come from and realize that there is no where bear enough food around to feed even a billion people.
Not only would we not have the infrastructure and technology to feed 8 billion people, we wouldn't even have access to the domesticated plants and animals that allow us to do this today.
We would not have access to modern corn, rice, wheat, semi-dwarf wheat or any of the other plants that were unedible before domestication. 
The first 30 days would be a whirlwind of political alliances and between groups following anybody who says they can secure food.
Initially world leaders would be protected, but without any means of communication they would have little power to get anything done. 
Many would simply give up and would wait hoping for a miracle before they starve, succumb to elements, or are killed.
People in rural areas would have the best chances at survival as they would have some chance at securing food resources before be set upon by ravenous city dwellers.
Despite this within the first month billions would die.
While some millions of people would find access to food, shelter, and maybe even enough people to form defenses, the next onslaught would be from a biological terror.
Billions of humans dead would mean thousands of billions of opportunities for version of proto maleria influeza and any manner of strange disease to mutate in insects and animals feasting on human corpses.
Humans may have enough modern immunity to face these plagues, but stone age animals would not.
The ecosystem would face a massive shift from billions of dead organisms.
At this point, we can safely assume that the amount of humans remaining is less than a 100 million,
spread across the globe, 
with no knowledge of other groups,
but in order to have survived this long these people must have enough resources to have some sort of longevity.
Likely the most common form would be roaming hunter-gatherer bands that having survived the extinctions now have reasonable good access to food and likely some ability to avoid predators. 
Some places may even be able to support some kind of permanent settlement, likely near water.
^[[[Fishing villages are likely the most ancient human settlement]]]
However, the psychological effects of these first months would be massive.
Without the reminders of human infrastructure, most humans would simply stop believing that there was anything before this time.
Their reality and memory would be so out of sink that the most logical belief would be that the before times were a fairy tale, and that life had always been like this.
Of course not everybody would immediately come this conclusion,
but even those with clear memories of the before times and their task would find in near impossible to understand how to complete it.
Perhaps a small percentage of the people who keep their wits about them would be able to keep track of the events, but an even smaller percentage of that would be charismatic enough to actually convince others around them to do so. 
These people likely would go on to form some sort of new religion based around an ancient artifact of an iPhone 13.
However it would likely be impossible for anybody who had knowledge of how to make an iphone 13 to act upon it or pass it one to their children. Oral tradition would struggle to preserve basic schematics, let alone the science of creating computer circuits out of miniscule lines of silicone.
Basically the only hope is the formation of a decent sized society forming within a single generation that is then able to get enough of the knowledge resources and political resources to get access to the physical resource.
If they are unable to craft the item in a generation, they would instead have to focus on educating the next generation not just on what to do but why.
This would be difficult as even many of the first generation would struggle to understand and believe the task.
You might be able to convince them to work towards the industry and technology needed, but I think you would struggle to convince them they are mining and manufacturing in order to return to a before time most of them are convinced doesn't exist.
