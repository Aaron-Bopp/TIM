#### [[Curate source notes and definitions in your second brain to avoid junk text]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

There is a difference between idly grabbing every article you read the headline of and absorbing relevant quotes into you [[second brain]]. There is a difference from creating friction for yourself with unfamiliar information that was copied and pasted from Wikipedia and using term notes to reduce friction. There is a difference in creating empty notes just for the graph and using note stubs to find spontaneous connections.
#TO/TEND/CONNECT [[The Collector's Fallacy]]

I believe the difference lies in curating the information in your vault and controlling the way you can access that information, and this is an integral part of [[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge]].

#TO/DO/CREATE [[Readwise Export for Obsidian - Templates and Process]]
For me, this process looks like this:
1. Import highlights that are relevant to my learning from what I read so that they are accessible through [[Obsidian (software)|]] search and I can return to the primary source easily.
	- This can be tedious on it's own. Use tools like that can do this automatically, e.g [[Readwise]]
2. Add definitions to term and topic notes so that they can be easily accessed with page preview.
	- The [[Dictionary (plugin, obsidian)|Dictionary]] and [[Wikipedia (plugin, obsidian)|Wikipedia]] plugins can streamline this
3. Absorb highlights and notes in the relevant [[evergreen notes]] by copying and qouting the text, but removing as much fat as possible.
	- This means that you may see text multiple times when searching, but because this means that you included that text in evergreen note, it should be valuable
4. When searches are performed they can be limited to only text within [[evergreen notes|evergreens]], [[topic note|topics]], or [[source notes|sources]] or some combination and the quality of the text will match the search.
