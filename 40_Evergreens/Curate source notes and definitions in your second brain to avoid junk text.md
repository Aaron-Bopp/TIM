#### [[Curate source notes and definitions in your second brain to avoid junk text]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This is an intergral part of [[How to collect thought in a second brain without creating friction]].

I believe the difference lies in curating the information in your vault and controlling the way you can access that information. For me this process looks this this:
1. Import highlights that are relevant to my learning from what I read so that they are accessible through [[Obsidian (software)|]] search and I can return to the primary source easily.
	- This can be tedious on it's own. Use tools like that can do this automatically, e.g [[Readwise]]
2. Add definitions to term and topic notes so that they can be easily accessed with page preview.
	- The [[Dictionary (plugin, obsidian)|]] and [[Wikipedia (plugin, obsidian)|]] plugins can streamline this
3. Absorb highlights and notes in the relevant [[evergreen notes]] by copying and qouting the text, but removing as much fat as possible.
	- This means that you may see text multiple times when searching, but because this means that you incuded that text in evergreen note, it should be valuable
4. When searches are performed they can be limited to only text within [[evergreen notes|evergreens]], [[topic note|topics]], or [[source notes|sources]] or some combination and the quality of the text will match the search.
