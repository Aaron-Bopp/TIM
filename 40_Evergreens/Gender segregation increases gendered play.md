#### [[Gender segregation increases gendered play]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

The [[gender segregation]] effect is the way that children separate themselves into male and female groups by gender, and has been observed across multiple different cultures with varying levels of gendered [[socialization]]. One possible root is boy's affinity for more energetic play, and girl's affinity for more social play. These likely have strong [[hormone|hormonal]] and [[genetic]] origins. Despite this effect being observed we also see that [[Gender has historically been non-binary]]. This may be due to a millennia long [[feedback loop]] as when children group themselves like this we see gendered behaviors being amplified, but children playing alone still have minimal gender differences: [[Gender is a social construct]]

One reason for this may be the interaction of [[Humans love to group eachother]] and [[Our understanding of gender begins at a very early age]]. At early ages one thing that we understand intuitively is our [[gender]] and thus it makes sense that this would happen across cultures, and shows how it could be a part of our [[Evolutionary Psychology]].
