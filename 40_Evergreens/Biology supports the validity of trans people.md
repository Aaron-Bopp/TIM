#### [[Biology supports the validity of trans people]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

> Present evidence seems to suggest that a person’s [[gender]] is established during gestation while the [[cerebral cortex]] of the brain is forming

[[Gender is a social construct]], explores how [[socialization]] creates and reinforces the [[gender binary]], but our pre-natal and [[hormone|hormonal]] environment are the scientific basis of our gender. This is the reason why [[Our understanding of gender begins at a very early age]] and supports the validity of [[transgender]] children and that [[You can discover your transness at any point in life]] 

If your assigned gender does not match your true gender your body will produce biological warnings of [[depression]], [[depersonalization]], [[derealization]], [[dissociation]], and obviously [[gender dysphoria]], but studies have shown that early social acceptance can bring these signs to near zero [^1]

Unfortunately, [[Trans children will repress their dysphoria if they have been effectively taught it is unacceptable]], which means that most trans children don't receive this kind of support.
