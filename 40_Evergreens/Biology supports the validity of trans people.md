#### [[Biology supports the validity of trans people]] 

> Present evidence seems to suggest that a personâ€™s [[gender]] is established during gestation while the [[cerebral cortex]] of the brain is forming

[[Gender is a social construct]], explores how [[socialization]] creates and reinforces the [[gender binary]], but our pre-natal and [[hormone|hormonal]] environment are the scientific basis of our gender. This is the reason 
why:: [[Our understanding of gender begins at a very early age]] and it 
supports:: the validity of [[Transgender people]] children and that [[You can discover your transness at any point in life]] 

If your assigned [[gender]] does not match your true gender your body will produce biological warnings of [[depression]], [[depersonalization]], [[derealization]], [[dissociation]], and obviously [[gender dysphoria]], but studies have shown that early social acceptance can bring these signs to near zero. 
^[[[course - Psychology of Race and Gender#Week 10]]]

Unfortunately, [[Trans children will repress their dysphoria if they have been effectively taught it is unacceptable]], which means that most trans children don't receive this kind of support. 

Sex determines [[phenotype]] and [[genotype]] but not [[gender]], although [[Sex is a social construct]] is also true.

similarly:: [[Gender has historically been non-binary]]
