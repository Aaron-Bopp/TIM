#### [[Hunter-gatherer societies were very diverse]] 

This is an
answer to:: [[Were hunter-gatherer societies egalitarian]].
The fact is that while most hunter-gatherer bands were of the size that could be naturally [[egalitarian]],
^[[[There is a limit to the size of a group ordered purely by personal communication]] 
which was enabled because
[[Foraging kept populations down]]]
we have much more evidence that they employed a variety of styles of [[social order]].

This meant that at times [[hunter-gatherers]] came together to produce great projects like [[Gobekli Tepe]],
but also that they were often violent and pushed other bands to the edge of extinction.
^[or complete extinction as in the case of [[Homo neanderthalis]]]

includes:: [[Hunter-gathers were capable of mass cooperation]]
