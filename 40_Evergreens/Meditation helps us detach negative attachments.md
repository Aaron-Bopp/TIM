#### [[Meditation helps us detach negative attachments]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[The brain lodges emotional reactions in our unconscious memory]] can lead to a variety of problems like carrying [[childhood]] [[trauma]] into adulthood,
^[[[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]]
or being overly logical,
^[[[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]]]
which ultimately lead to an overactive [[ego]] that prevents use from processing our the repressed [[emotions]].
^[[[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]]]
We can get past the [[ego]] by calming our [[mind]] using [[meditation]] and directly accessing our [[unconscious]].

See the [[unconscious]] [[mind]] preventing our [[conscious]] mind from accessing those memories directly
by constantly putting up thoughts to prevent them from sinking in.

This isn't an easy process, as the [[ego]] will be trying it's hardest to protect it's current state.
This process requires introspection and [[observation]] of your [[mind-body complex]] and it's processes.

[[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]] so your surroundings can impede this process. [[Raja Yoga]] and practicing [[Shuddhi]] will help you avoid this 
^[[[notes_Shuddhi]]]

Remember, [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]]
and [[Working through trauma can involve of a lot of letting go]],
so it is important to understand
[[How to process repressed emotions]]
