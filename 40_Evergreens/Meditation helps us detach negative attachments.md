#### [[Meditation helps us detach negative attachments]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

The [[Association Cortices]] are what make the attachments that we use to survive
^[[[Our brains are built around survival]]]
but they do that by lodging things in our [[subconscious]] called [[Samskara]].
If those attachments are left unchecked it can lead to very bad things 
^[[[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]]]
but [[meditation]] allows us to gain [[control]] over our [[subconscious]] and [[detachment]] from those [[emotions]].

- [[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]]
- [[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]
- [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]]
- [[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]]
- [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]]
- [[Working through trauma can involve of a lot of letting go]]
