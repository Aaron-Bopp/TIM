#### [[Meditation helps us detach negative attachments]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

%% #TO/TEND/WEED %%
[[Our brain actively inhibits us from processing repressed emotions]] can lead to a variety of problems like carrying [[childhood]] [[trauma]] into adulthood,
^[[[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]]
or being overly logical.
^[[[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]]]
These are both manifestations of 
[[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]].
We can get past the [[ego]] by calming our [[mind]] using [[meditation]] and directly accessing our [[unconscious]]
^[[[Meditation is a practice to gain control over your thoughts]]]

See the [[unconscious]] [[mind]] preventing our [[conscious]] mind from accessing those memories directly
by constantly putting up thoughts to prevent them from sinking in.

This isn't an easy process, as the [[ego]] will be trying it's hardest to protect it's current state.
This process requires introspection and [[observation]] of your [[mind-body complex]] and it's processes.

[[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]] so your surroundings can impede this process. [[Raja Yoga]] and practicing [[Shuddhi]] will help you avoid this 
^[[[notes_Shuddhi]]]

Remember, [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]]
and [[Working through trauma can involve of a lot of letting go]],
so it is important to understand
[[How to process repressed emotions]]
