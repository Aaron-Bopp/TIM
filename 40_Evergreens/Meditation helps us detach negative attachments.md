#### [[Meditation helps us detach negative attachments]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

First we need to understand that [[Our brain actively inhibits us from processing repressed emotions]].
This can lead to a variety of problems like carrying [[childhood]] [[trauma]] into adulthood,
^[[[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]]
or being overly logical, 
^[[[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]]]
which are both manifestations of our [[ego]].
^[[[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]]]
We can get past the [[ego]] by calming our [[mind]] using [[meditation]] and directly accessing our [[unconscious]].
^[[[Meditation is a practice to gain control over your thoughts]]]

This isn't an easy process, as the [[ego]] ([[Ahamkara]]) will be trying it's hardest to protect it's current state by creating and uneasy and defensive emotional state ([[Manas]]).

It does this by drawing up stored [[emotions]] ([[Samskara]])
from the [[unconscious]] [[mind]] ([[Citta]])
that prevent our [[consciousness|conscious]] mind ([[Buddhi]]) 
from [[understanding]] what is going on.
^[[[notes_Vedic Psychology]]]

If we can calm our emotional state using [[therapy]] or [[meditation]] we can access and heal those negative [[Samskara]]. 

This process requires introspection and [[observation]] of your [[mind-body complex]] and it's processes.
The goal of this process is to better understand the [[self]] that was formed in early [[childhood]], and to recover from childhood wounds that are still affecting us: 
[[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]

[[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]] so your surroundings can impede this process. [[Raja Yoga]] and [[Shuddhi]] will help you avoid this 
^[[[notes_How to achieve]]]

Remember, [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]]
and [[Working through trauma can involve of a lot of letting go]],
so it is important to understand
[[How to process repressed emotions]]

In contrast to this process, often times [[A conversion experience can help us reshape our sense of self]]
