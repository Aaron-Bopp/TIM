#### [[Meditation helps us detach negative attachments]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

First we need to understand that [[Our brain actively inhibits us from processing repressed emotions]].
This can lead to a variety of problems like carrying [[childhood]] [[trauma]] into adulthood,
^[[[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]]
or being overly logical, 
^[[[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]]]
which are both manifestations of our [[ego]].
^[[[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]]]
We can get past the [[ego]] by calming our [[mind]] using [[meditation]] and directly accessing our [[unconscious]].
^[[[Meditation is a practice to gain control over your thoughts]]]

See the [[unconscious]] [[mind]] preventing our [[conscious]] mind from accessing those memories directly
by constantly putting up thoughts to prevent them from sinking in.

Once the mind is calm, these thoughts can make their way through

This isn't an easy process, as the [[ego]] will be trying it's hardest to protect it's current state.
This process requires introspection and [[observation]] of your [[mind-body complex]] and it's processes.
The goal of this process is to better understand the [[self]] that was formed in early [[childhood]], and to recover from childhood wounds that are still affecting us: 
[[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]

[[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]] so your surroundings can impede this process. [[Raja Yoga]] and practicing [[Shuddhi]] will help you avoid this 
^[[[notes_How to achieve]]]

Remember, [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]]
and [[Working through trauma can involve of a lot of letting go]],
so it is important to understand
[[How to process repressed emotions]]

In constrast to this process, often times [[A conversion experience can help us reshape our sense of self]]
