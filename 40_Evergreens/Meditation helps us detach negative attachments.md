#### [[Meditation helps us detach negative attachments]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[brain emo]]
[[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]] because of 
[[How memory works]] and [[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]].
[[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]] and will create [[rationalizations]] to prevent us from accessing and healing our [[Samskara]]. 

[[Consciousness is our capacity to introspect]] and [[Meditation is a practice to develop a stronger conscious]]. 
We can get past the [[ego]] by calming our [[mind]] and directly accessing our [[unconscious]].

^[[[notes_Intro to Mantra Practice]]]

This isn't an easy process, as the [[ego]] will be trying it's hardest to protect itself.
[[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]] and [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]] so you will have to work through a lot of big [[emotions]] to get there.

[[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]] so your surroundings can impede this process. [[Raja Yoga]] and practicing [[Shuddhi]] will help you avoid this 
^[[[notes_Shuddhi]]]

Remember, [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]]
and [[Working through trauma can involve of a lot of letting go]].
