#### [[People are radicalized when they are convinced that change is out of their control]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`


#TO/TEND/MULCH 
The incel movement is based off two major things
1. [[mysogyny]]
2. the myth of the chad

The myth of the chad is the thing that is important here. This is the idea that the only kind of man that is appealing to [[women]] is once who fit's into a very narrow definition of attractiveness. This leaves many incels to feelings of almost [[body dysmorphia]] where they are completely unable to accept their [[body]]. You can see then that [[mysogyny]] really lies in this as well, and the root of this [[insecurity]] is toxic [[gender roles]] and [[Patriarchy]].

This ideal body is completely unattainable and that is what leads incels to Radicalization or the "red pill."

An interesting connection may be to left-wing radicals, who are radicalized by the complete brokenness of the system. 

interesting example of escaping the [[alt-right pipeline]]: [i had a ben shapiro/jordan peterson phase... and i'm glad i did - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3r01BruBok)
