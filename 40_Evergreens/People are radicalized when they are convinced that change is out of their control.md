#### [[People are radicalized when they are convinced that change is out of their control]] 

People can be radicals and still believe in change,
^[In fact they need to believe in order for change to happen [[Hope is not optimism it is a practice for producing change]]]
radicalization is often founded in a feeling of helplessness.

This creates an interesting connection between left-wing and right-wing radicals. 
Often are convinced that their is something out out of their control, but for leftists it is the system and for conservatives it is individuals.

> [!example]
> 
> The incel movement is based off two major things
> 1. [[mysogyny]]
> 2. the myth of the chad
> 
> The myth of the chad is the thing that is important here. This is the idea that the only kind of man that is appealing to women is once who fit's into a very narrow definition of attractiveness. 
> This ideal body is completely unattainable and that is what leads incels to [[radicalization]] or the "red pill."
> They feel like the control is completely out of their hands and that the only choice they have is [[mysogyny]].
> They know that hating women isn't going to improve their chances, but because they have built this myth, [[sexism]] is the only way they can gain power in the situation.

This can also be seen in [[Republicans have become a true opposition party]].
Conservatives are not radical because their goal is not change it is opposition.

##### Counterpoint:: [[Q justifies conservatives discontent]]

It seems that a lot of people in Q are actually convinced that change is coming, and that someone is in control. 
However, as is evidenced by their repeated acceptance that one prediction is wrong but the next will be right does match with this trait. They may feel like somebody is in control but they know they are not in control.
