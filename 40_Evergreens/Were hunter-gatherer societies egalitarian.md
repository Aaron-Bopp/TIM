#### [[Were hunter-gatherer societies egalitarian]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

works with:: [[What is the origin of social hierarchy]]
part of:: [[What enables large scale social order]]

[[David Sloan Wilson]] believes that [[hunter-gatherers]] were egalitarian through a [[social control]] called reverse dominance which is an element of social [[game theory]]. 
This lines up with his belief that [[Moral social control promotes pro-social behavior in groups]]
- [[hunter-gatherers]] may have also had high levels of [[social control]] from [[religion]]'s like [[Animism]] and that lead to sites like [[Gobekli Tepe]]

- involves:: [[What is the link between evolution and social behavior]]
- [[Hunter-gatherer societies were very diverse]]
- [[Hunter-gathers were capable of mass cooperation]]
