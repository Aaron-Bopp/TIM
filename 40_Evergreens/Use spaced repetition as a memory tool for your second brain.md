#### [[Use spaced repetition as a memory tool for your second brain]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Nodes in the second brain are an abstraction of our first brain]], but there are some key differences, one of them being the way that we memorize things.
We remember things by making connections to them, whether that be an acronym, a song, or just remembering something in sequence,
^[this is how we memorize long passages, we are connecting one sequence to the next]
we are making connections that allow us to remember that thing.
Sometimes these connections can be made almost completely autonomously, but in the [[second brain]] we often have to make these connections manually.
This introduces [[friction]], which is in direct contradiction to the [[philosophy]] of [[My TIM]]:
[[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge]]

[[Spaced repetition]] can help allieviate this friction
- [[Use spaced repetition as weeding for your digital garden]]
- [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]]
- [[The fragility of nodes in a second brain]]
- [[Webs of thought are densely linked]]
