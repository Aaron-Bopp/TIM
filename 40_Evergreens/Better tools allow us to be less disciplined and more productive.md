%%
#TO/DO/CONCEPTUALIZE 
[The Collector’s Fallacy • Zettelkasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/) is an example of this. %%

Less disciplined does not always mean less productive, and when your lack of discipline is a symptom of more powerful tools. [[Friction is the number one hindrance to learning]] talks about how friction stunts the process of learning. Discipline can be used to overcome this friction, such as with [[Niklas Luhmann]]'s [[Zettlekassen]],
^[[[We are confined to the tools of our time]]]
 but modern tools allow us to overcome both the friction of discipline and the [[friction]] the discipline was trying to solve.

- [[The more mistakes you've fixed the more bad decisions you can afford]]
- [[Powerful tools make dangerous toys]]
