#### [[Creating Thought with a Second Brain]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

 If your primary goal is to create thought your system then it should be setup in a way that prioritizes your workflow. [[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]] is one such methodology, but your purposes and your mind will influence how you setup your [[second brain]] and the act of creating your [[Second Brain]] can be used as a catalyst or conduit to create thought: [[Learning how systems work can be a gateway to creating thought]]
 
One universal truth is that your [[second brain]] should not be a hindrance to creating though. [[Friction is the number one hindrance to learning]]. Friction can mean overloading yourself with structures than need to be followed instead of just getting down to thinking. Or friction can be not giving yourself enough structure to avoid being overwhelmed you.
- [[Separate stub notes from the rest of your vault so you don't get overwhelmed]]
- [[Curate source notes and definitions in your second brain to avoid junk text]]

As you are creating thought it is important to recoginize [[The fragility of nodes in a second brain]].
