#### [[Our biology has not significantly changed for thousands of years]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Cultural evolution is not confined to the slow process of genetic evolution]] means that we are both incredibly different than our ancient ancestors and also incredibly the same. 
The last 10,000 years
that have included 99% of
the development of the human [[social order]] 
are miniscule in the time frame of [[human evolution]]. 
The amount and kind of inputs in our environment are nothing like any other point in [[history]], 
but our genetic environment is almost unchanged.

- [[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]]
