#### [[Meditation helps us regulate our nervous system]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Meditation]] can regulate the [[ANS]] by activating the [[Sympathetic Nervous System]] or [[Parasympathetic Nervous System]] to keep them in balance.
^[[[notes_Science of Meditation#Meditation helps us regulate our nervous system]]]

These systems impact the entire [[mind-body complex]] which can get you out of your [[fight-or-flight response]], and many other things: [[Meditation improves mental, physical, and emotional health]]

- [[Our brains are built around survival]] 
	- [[Social anxiety isn't irrational it's just overcompensation]]
		- You shouldn't be having to deal with [[Cortisol]] and [[Adrenaline]] just going to school and talking to people
