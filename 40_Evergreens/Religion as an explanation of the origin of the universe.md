#### [[Religion as an explanation of the origin of the universe]]

This is the [[religion]] that people are most aware of as it is the belief all major world religions. 
[[Christianity]] points to a creator god that is eternal and omnipresent, and yet human like. This god created the world in seven days and created us in his image.

[[Hinduism]] imagines the origin of the universe as a development out of [[Brahman]] #TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH 
Which means this
includes:: [[Consciousness as the spark of life]] and [[Consciousness is the fundamental unit of existence]]

What is Islam's story #TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH 

answers:: [[What is the origin of life]]

How does [[dualism]] play into this?
