#### [[Humans are addicted to believing]] 

Humans want to believe because [[Humans have decided to reject an unjust world]]. We long for security in our life so that we can [[progress]], so we turn to [[belief]]. 
^[To be clear, this thinking isn't wrong,
the problem is when we pathologize this addiction and spread it as far as we can: [[Evangelicalism has commodified faith for profit]]]

[[Belief]] helps us deal with living in an unjust world:
- [[Belief helps us push through hardship]]
- [[Faith can be a useful tool for grounding yourself]]

The effects are
- [[Humans yearn for a tool with no blood on it]]
- [[Is cognitive dissonance the reason for harmful behaviors]]

Example:: Me watching [[video - A brief history of quantom mechanics]]
Example:: Me learning about [[The history of meditation is a mixture of science and spirituality]]
