#### [[Humans are addicted to believing]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Humans want to believe because [[Humans have decided to reject an unjust world]]. It is built into our core DNA to believe that certain things are true and certain things are false. We long for a security in our life so that we can [[progress]], so we turn to [[belief]]. 
To be clear, this thinking isn't wrong,
the problem is when we pathologize this addiction and spread it as far as we can: [[Evangelicalism has commodified faith for profit]]

- [[Belief pulls you forward into life]]
- [[Faith can be a useful tool for grounding yourself]]


- [[The three main questions of life]]
- [[Humans are a product of evolution]]
- [[Humans yearn for a tool with no blood on it]]
- [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]]
- [[Is cognitive dissonance the reason for harmful behaviors]]
- [[Hope is not optimism it is a practice for producing change]]
- [[What is the cognitive effect of living in an unjust world]]
