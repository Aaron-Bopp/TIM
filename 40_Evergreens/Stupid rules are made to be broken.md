#### [[Stupid rules are made to be broken]] 

[[Stupid rules are made to be broken]] is something that my mother said to me, which is ironic because I then went on to break many of the rules that she did NOT think were stupid.
^[[[My Deconstruction journey]]]
This idea was the foundation for my sense of [[justice]],
^[the combination of [[Autism]] and [[Religious concepts are often too powerful for a child's mind]] really brought this home for me]
which I think is why this was much more impactful than she realized. To her it was just saying, "It's okay to eat a little chocolate even when it's not your cheat day," but for me it was the seed of the idea that the [[law]] does not always bring about [[justice]]. This seed developed into my dissatisfaction with the unfair systems, and systemic bias.

- [[Colonization and slavery lead to generational disparities in black communities]]
%%
I wonder if mom's sense of justice came more from the fact that she was entitled and less from any sense of true [[justice]]. I think she does have that sense, but I'm not sure
