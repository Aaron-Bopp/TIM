A lot of people who have left the church who still have nightmares and the fear of hell, it's just hard to get rid of. Hell is rarely mentioned in the bible and when it is, it isn't a literal fiery hell. A lot of our modern [[perception]] of hell comes from comes from dante's fictional inferno, but that doesn't mean that conditioning and almost brainwashing isn't still there haunting many [[Christianity|christians]]. 

The reason is [[The danger of religious beliefs in early childhood]].
