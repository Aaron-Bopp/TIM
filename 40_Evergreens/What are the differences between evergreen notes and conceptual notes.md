#### [[What are the differences between evergreen notes and conceptual notes]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Andy Matuschak's Evergreen Notes]] defines there key properties
 - concept-oriented
 - atomicity
 - emphasis on linkage
 - serendipity
 - develop over time 
I have evolved this to include
- [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]]
- [[Evergreen notes should be constantly integrating new knowledge]]

[[Conceptual notes]] is an aspect of [[evergreen notes]], but it is something of it's own. #TO/PONDER/ME
