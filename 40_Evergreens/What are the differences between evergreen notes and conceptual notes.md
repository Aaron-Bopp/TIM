#### [[What are the differences between evergreen notes and conceptual notes]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

> By contrast, because [Evergreen notes should be atomic](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4Rrmh17vMBbauEGnFPTZSK3UmdsGExLRfZz1), theyâ€™re small enough in scope that you can start and finish one note in well under half an hour...Yet each note you write represents an increment in your thinking about that specific idea, and each note enriches the broader network of links.

[[Andy Matuschak's Evergreen Notes]] define [[evergreen notes]] as both [concept-oriented](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6bci25mVUBNFdVWSrQNKr6u7AZ1jFzfTVbMF) and [atomic](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4Rrmh17vMBbauEGnFPTZSK3UmdsGExLRfZz1) but in my vault I have primarily combined these concepts. This is partially because I think that
[[Conceptual note is a better term than atomic note]], but is primarily because [[Conceptual notes vary in size and scope]].
I do not think that there is any universal size that you should aim for in [[note writing]]. 

I have evolved this to include
- [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]]
- [[Evergreen notes should be constantly integrating new knowledge]]

[[Conceptual notes]] is an aspect of [[evergreen notes]], but they aren't synonyms. #TO/PONDER/ME
