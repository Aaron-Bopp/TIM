Despite the simple origins of genetic variation, the process of [[natural selection]] that results from them is not.
Selection is a complicated process that involves aspects at every level of complexity, from interactions between cells, to between individuals, to between populations.

- cells: [[Evolution can create systems capable of natural selection]]
- populations: [[Cultural evolution is not confined to the slow process of genetic evolution]]
- similarly:: [[Human behavior is selective]]
	- [[Intentionality is not separate from functionality]] and vice versa
