#### [[The actual work of being a good person isn't explored by Christianity]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

#TO/TEND/BRIDGE this and [[The danger of religious beliefs in early childhood]]

Have [[faith]] and you will be saved. Believe in the lord god and he will make your pain go away. All empty promises. [[Christianity]] hides the work and the struggle so that it can convert and control more people: [[Worldviews are wrong if they make life seem easy and simple]]

[[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]], and because [[Christianity]] is taught so early in childhood [^1] this is even more impactful: [[The danger of religious beliefs in early childhood]]

[^1]: [[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood|childhood trauma causes us to make wide assumptions about the world]]

[[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things]], and if we believe are saved we cannot comprehend choosing damnation: [[Christians struggle to feel empathy because they must believe that non-christians are going to hell]]
