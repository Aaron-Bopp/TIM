#### [[Belief pulls you forward into life]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

#TO/TEND/GRAFT 
- [[Does cognitive dissonance increase your capacity for endurance]]
- [[Sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion]]
- [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]]

As opposed to dragging you back in life like the [[mind]] often does: 
[[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]

- contrast: [[Anger fuels change]]
- [[Bhakti Yoga]]
- [[Be the change you want to see in the world]]
- [[You can leave the church without loosing your faith]]
- [[You can't blame people for failing to rise above their circumstances]]
