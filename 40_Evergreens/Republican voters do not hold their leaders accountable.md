#### [[Republican voters do not hold their leaders accountable]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This is a fact of the [[Rise of Modern Conservatism]] and 
part of:: how [[Ronald Reagan invented modern conservatism]].
[[Reagan]]'s campaigns were full of unfulfilled promises, but his rhetoric and charm were enough to keep his approval rating high for his entire two terms. 

They still align various political causes with moral imperatives including, "the establishment of a pro-growth tax code," [^1] and claim that the only way to bring, "safety to [America's] citizens," [^2] is through a Republican president. Republicans also continue in his trend of campaigning on things that they put no effort towards doing, including abolishing [[abortion]], opposing tax policies that, "divide [[America|Americans]] or promote class warfare," [^3] and of course balancing the budget.

This is partially 
because:: [[Single issue voters are anti-democratic]]
and [[Conservatism|Conservatives]] are mainly single issue voters and the
result of:: [[The moral majority movement was the original 'making things political']]
