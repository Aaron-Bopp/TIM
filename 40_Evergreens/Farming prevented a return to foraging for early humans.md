#### [[Farming prevented a return to foraging for early humans]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Many of the aspects that made [[foraging]] successful and stable for so long ended up being it's downfall.
[[Foraging kept populations down]] because lower populations were all that were sustainable, and these lower populations kept foraging stable. 
While [[Hunter-gathers were capable of mass cooperation]] like in the case of [[Gobekli Tepe]], this was not the everyday way of life. 
[[Foraging allowed for a diverse diet]], and for a general ease of life by keeping groups separated into small enough groups that they could feed and govern themselves.

The advent of farming was not a stroke of genius by any one human, it was a coincidence of one species taking advantage of another, making this a
result of:: [[Farming domesticated humans]].

While humans were the ones manually spreading, planting, and harvesting wheat, it's effect on the human [[social order]] was out of any individuals control.
[[Farming outcompeted foraging by allowing for higher populations]], meaning that over generations farming became an unavoidable way of life.
Just as [[foraging]] was stable because of low populations, once farming allowed for higher populations there was no turning back.

This is an
example of:: [[When luxury becomes a necessity it is no longer a luxury]]
