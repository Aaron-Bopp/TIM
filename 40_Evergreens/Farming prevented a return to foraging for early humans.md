#### [[Farming prevented a return to foraging for early humans]] 

[[Foraging was a very sustainable lifestyle]], but
many of the aspects that made [[foraging]] successful and stable for so long ended up being it's downfall.
It doesn't matter that foragers worked less or had better diets,
[[Farming outcompeted foraging by allowing for higher populations]].

This is the
result of:: [[Farming domesticated humans]].
The advent of farming was not a stroke of genius by any one human, it was a coincidence of one species taking advantage of another.
The changes that [[farming]] allowed happened slowly enough that we did not realize what we were losing until it was gone.

While [[Hunter-gathers were capable of mass cooperation]] like in the case of [[Gobekli Tepe]], this was not the everyday way of life. 
[[Human settlement allowed for social order to rapidly evolve]] and soon people could no longer remember the [[Imagined order]] of [[foraging]].
Said another way, once farming allowed for higher populations than could be supported by [[foraging]], it seemed the only option was to continue [[farming]].

This is an
example of:: [[When luxury becomes a necessity it is no longer a luxury]].
