#### [[Biological processes can only give context to behavior not predict it]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Many people believe existence to be a deterministic process. One action leads to the next, and really our choice are little more than predictable to results of our environment, if only we could properly observe and understand the intracacies of our [[brain]]. 
This is an important consideration in the question of 
[[Do we have free will]], but
whether it is true or not, we can all recognize that we *feel* like we have much more control over our lives that this would lead us to [[belief]].
It is true that
[[Complex emotions are intellectual understandings of primal urges]], 
and that our [[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]], 
but neither of these can fully explain [[human behavior]], not even close.

[[Evolutionary Psychology]] has tried 

[[Most problems cannot be significantly understood through a single framework]]

- [[Our brains are built around survival]]
- [[Our brain actively inhibits us from processing repressed emotions]]
- [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]]
