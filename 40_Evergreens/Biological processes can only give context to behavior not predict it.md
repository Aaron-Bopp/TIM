#### [[Biological processes can only give context to behavior not predict it]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Many people believe existence to be a deterministic process. One action leads to the next, and really our choices are little more than predictable to results of our environment, if only we could properly observe and understand the intricacies of our [[brain]].
This is an important consideration in the question of 
[[Do we have free will]],
but whether it is true or not, we can all recognize that we *feel* like we have much more control over our lives that this would lead us to [[belief|believe]].
^[In [[eastern philosophy]] this idea is explored through [[Karma Fal]].]
It is true that
[[Complex emotions are intellectual understandings of primal urges]], 
and that our [[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]], 
but neither of these can fully explain [[human behavior]], not even close.

[[Evolutionary Psychology]] tries to understand [[human behavior]] through the framework of [[natural selection]] and [[Evolution]], but doing so without acknowledging to powerful influences of [[group selection]] and [[Cultural Evolution]] is folly.
[[Most problems cannot be significantly understood through a single framework]], and 
[[Experts are often far too confident in the effectiveness of their theories]]. 

[[David Sloan Wilson]] speaks in detail about this in his book [[books_Darwin's Cathedral|Darwin's Cathedral]]

> Psychologists should be trying to identify and understand these specialized circuits [that enable us to solve our own problems of survival and reproduction] rather than pretending that [[human behavior]] can be derived from a few law-like mechanistic principles. 
> ^[[[books_Darwin's Cathedral#292537218q]]]


Nevertheless it is true that
[[Our brains are built around survival]].
Studying the biological influences of people's behaviors can of course give great insight into our [[behavior]].
