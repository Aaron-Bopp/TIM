#### [[Biological processes can only give context to behavior not predict it]] 

Many people believe existence to be a deterministic process. One action leads to the next, and really our choices are little more than predictable results of our environment.
If only we could properly observe and understand the intricacies of our [[brain]], then 
we could predict our [[behavior]].

This is an important consideration in the question of 
[[Do we have free will]],
but whether it is true or not, we can all recognize that we *feel* like we have much more control over our lives than this would lead us to [[belief|believe]]. 
^[This is a confusing relationship for many of us, sometimes feeling like we are in control and sometimes feeling like every decision we make is just a product of our brain chemistry. [[What constitutes a decision]]]

Many people look to [[Evolution]] to provide the explanations for our [[behavior]].
%% #TO/TEND/WEED  %%
This is because for years [[Evolutionary Psychology]] has been claiming to have found "the gorging gene" or "the aggression gene,"
but [[Evolutionary Psychology is just a framework not a prescription of behavior]].

%% #TO/TEND/MULCH 
[[David Sloan Wilson]] speaks in detail about this in his book [[10_Sources/books - Darwin's Cathedral|Darwin's Cathedral]]

> Psychologists should be trying to identify and understand these specialized circuits [that enable us to solve our own problems of survival and reproduction] rather than pretending that [[human behavior]] can be derived from a few law-like mechanistic principles. 
> ^[[[10_Sources/books - Darwin's Cathedral#292537218q]]]

We will likely never be able to fully predict behavior based of of individual genes, but it is undeniable that that we can explain some behaviors through [[Neuroscience]] and [[natural selection]]. 
^[Keep in mind [[Most problems cannot be significantly understood through a single framework]]. This has been in the downfall of many great scientists because [[Experts are often far too confident in the effectiveness of their theories]]]

#TO/TEND/MULCH 
It is true that
[[Complex emotions are imperfect understandings of primal urges]], 
and that our [[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]], 
but neither of these can fully explain [[human behavior]], not even close.

Nevertheless it is true that
[[Our brains are built around survival]].
Studying the biological influences of people's behaviors can of course give great insight into our [[behavior]] as long as we understand that
