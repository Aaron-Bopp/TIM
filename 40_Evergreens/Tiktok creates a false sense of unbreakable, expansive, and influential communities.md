#### [[Tiktok creates a false sense of unbreakable, expansive, and influential communities]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This sense is false because the [[community]] can be removed at anytime (banned, algorithm changes, whims of [[culture]]), it can be overrun by foul actors (through some algorithmic method), it can only be kept through constant interaction with the community. Yet while you are in it, you feel like this community is real and expansive, far more influential than it actually is: [[The internet allows niche topics to flourish]] 

[[Communities are support systems]], and once you have come to rely on a [[community]] like [[Tiktok]] it is devistating to lose it.

[[Communities are knowledge graphs]], if the way the you communicate and find information changes then this aspect is disrupted. This is extremely common on a platform driven by [[algorithmic content]].
