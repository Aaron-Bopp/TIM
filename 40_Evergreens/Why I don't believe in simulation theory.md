#### [[Why I don't believe in simulation theory]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

#TO/WRITE summary of [[simulation theory]]

1. I do not think we will reach a level of computing high enough to simulate human thought. 
This is due to the death of [[Moore's law]] and the limits of [[quantum computing]]
1. If we did reach that level of computing, why would we create a simulation with so many limitations?
Relativity and the limit of the speed of light, evolution as a mechanism of change, all these things are extremely inefficient at creating an interesting world.

At the core of [[theology]] is the [[belief]] that the world does not make sense without a creator, due to the complexity of life. 
[[simulation theory]] posits not only that we will eventually be capable of simulating this complexity, but that we would recreate it.
This goes directly against the reasons that religions have been created
^[[[Faith is an abstraction of cognitive dissonance]], and [[The materialistic view of religions examines why humans invented and clung to religion]]]
and against basic knowledge of [[Computer Science]].
