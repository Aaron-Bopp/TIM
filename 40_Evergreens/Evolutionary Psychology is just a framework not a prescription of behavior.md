#### [[Evolutionary Psychology is just a framework not a prescription of behavior]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Evolutionary Psychology]] was never meant to be the end all be all of describing and predicting [[behavior]]. [[Biological processes can only give context to behavior not predict it]]

- [[Complex emotions are intellectual understandings of primal urges]]
- [[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]]

#TO/TEND/MULCH 
but doing so without acknowledging to powerful influences of [[group selection]] and [[Cultural Evolution]] is folly.
[[Most problems cannot be significantly understood through a single framework]], and 
[[Experts are often far too confident in the effectiveness of their theories]].
