#### [[Evolutionary Psychology is just a framework not a prescription of behavior]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Evolutionary Psychology]] was never meant to be the end all be all of describing and predicting [[behavior]].
Alas, [[Experts are often far too confident in the effectiveness of their theories]],
and early flounderings have resulted in a somewhat skeptical view of [[Evolutionary Psychology]] today.
If we acknowledge that
[[Most problems cannot be significantly understood through a single framework]],
and properly contrast this [[framework]] with others,
we can attempt to use our [[understanding]] of [[human evolution]] effectively.

> [!example]
> 
> [[Humans have had little time to adjust to being the top predator]] means that 
> [[Our brains are built around survival]], but our environments practically guarantee it. 
> This [[cognitive dissonance]] leads to phenomena like [[existential dread]],
> conclusions like:: [[Most anxiety isn't irrational it's just overcompensation]]
> and 
> provides the mechanism behind::
> [[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]

#TO/TEND/MULCH 
[[Our biology has not significantly changed for thousands of years]] means that we are still dealing with minds or ancient [[hunter-gatherers]].
Of course, 
while the difference in our [[DNA]] is small,
the [[brain]] is incredibly adaptive,
which means our examination of [[human origins]] is most helpful as
a starting point.

#TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH a more thorough understanding of the argument against [[Evolutionary Psychology]]
