#### [[Evolutionary Psychology is just a framework not a prescription of behavior]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Evolutionary Psychology]] was never meant to be the end all be all of describing and predicting [[behavior]].
Alas, [[Experts are often far too confident in the effectiveness of their theories]],
and early floundering's have resulted in a somewhat skeptical view of [[Evolutionary Psychology]] today.
If we acknowledge that
[[Most problems cannot be significantly understood through a single framework]],
and properly contrast this framework with others,
we can attempt to use our [[understanding]] of [[human evolution]] effectively.

[[Cultural evolution is not confined to the slow process of genetic evolution]] means that we are both incredibly different than our ancient ancestors and also incredibly the same. 
The last 10,000 years
that have included 99% of
the development of the human [[social order]] 
are miniscule in the time frame of [[human evolution]]. 
The amount and kind of inputs in our environment are nothing like any other point in [[history]], 
but our genetic environment is almost unchanged.

> [!example]
[[Humans have had little time to adjust to being the top predator]] means that 
[[Our brains are built around survival]], but our environments practically guarantee it. 
This [[cognitive dissonance]] leads to phenomena like [[existential dread]],
conclusions like:: [[Most anxiety isn't irrational it's just overcompensation]]
and 
provides the mechanism behind::
[[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]

#TO/TEND/MULCH 
Of course, the [[brain]] is incredibly adaptive so the lack of difference in our [[DNA]] is likely dwarfed by the difference in our [[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment|chemical environment]].
This means our examination of [[human origins]] is most helpful as
a starting point.
By properly understanding [[Evolutionary Psychology]] as a framework we can properly acknowledge that
[[Complex emotions are imperfect understandings of primal urges]]
in the light of
[[Biological processes can only give context to behavior not predict it]]
