#### [[The advent of farming lead to increased prevalence of anxiety]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

part of:: [[Did hunter-gatherers lead better lives than us]]

By the simple nature of [[farming]] it requires more forethought than [[foraging]]. A forager may need to worry about finding food and avoiding predators, but a farmer has to worry about the weather, raiders, how much food they'll need, how much strain they will have to undertake to plant that food, and then they must wait months for the fruits of their labor.
