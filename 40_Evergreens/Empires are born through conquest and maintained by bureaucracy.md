#### [[Empires are born through conquest and maintained by bureaucracy]] 

The ways to maintain control over large swaths of people is not a problem that can be solved by any one solution. Understanding [[social order]] is the quest of almost any great mind.
Yet it seems that bookkeeping and [[bureaucracy]] may have been the key difference that allowed for the developments of [[history]]'s first major empires.

This power of [[bureaucracy]] may not just be in holding and storing [[information]], but also in providing stability. Mildness and tolerance seem far more effective at maintaining a long-term empire than [[violence]].

- part of:: [[What maintains our social order]]
- why:: [[The first recorded name might have been an accountant]]
- explains:: [[Sumerians invented writing to store large amounts of data]]

##### Counterpoint:: Only empires *we know of* were maintained by [[bureaucracy]]

[[Hunter-gathers were capable of mass cooperation]], perhaps the *true* first empires didn't need [[bureaucracy]],
thus we have no physical records of them. 
This would be supported by [[The Inca empire was maintained without a full script writing system]].
