#### [[The ego is the brain's response to the realization that we are just another individual in the world]] 

When we are child we are the center of our world. All we know is our [[perception]], and what we are perceiving is every person we know waiting on us hand and foot.
You can see how when we realize that we are not the center of the universe, that can be quite a shock.

Not only is this a shock, this fact is in complete dissonance with our understanding of the world.
[[Children make wide assumptions about the world]] shows that our [[childhood]] brains can be very powerful in the shaping of our psyche. 
Perhaps this shock is the origin of our capacity and aptitude for handling [[cognitive dissonance]]? Or the [[ego]] is our childhood brain's response to this intense [[cognitive dissonance]]?
If so this
answers:: [[Why do humans have such a high capacity for cognitive dissonance]]

- leads to:: [[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]]
- part of:: [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]]
- works with:: [[Our brain actively inhibits us from processing repressed emotions]]
