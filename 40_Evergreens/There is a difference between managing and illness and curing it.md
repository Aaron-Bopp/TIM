#### [[There is a difference between managing and illness and curing it]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This is often the difference between prescriptive and holistic treatment.

[[Yoga is a wholistic philosophy of self-improvement]], because it encourages and lifestyle that can improve your life. This is not to say that it is a substitute for drugs, but [[Drugs may be being overprescribed]] and really what would improve people's live is a lifestyle change.

^[[[Meditation improves mental, physical, and emotional health]]]
all holistically improve your [[mental health]].
