#### [[Placing people on the spectrum of thinking vs doing]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

![[Journal#^0fb209]]

People who can only think when writing are closer to thinking than doing but not by much.

![[Writing is a catalyst of understanding#^ddee69]]

Theoretical scientists are really far on the thinking side

![[Journal#^652eba]]

Craftsmen and artists are often pretty far on the doer side but it can vary

(Good) politicians are all over the spectrum but usually the best ones are far on the doing side. Think president has cabinet for thinking but they still have to make the decision.

#TO/PONDER/IDEA 
When thinkers do are the doing because of thinking or are they doing in addition to the thinking and vice versa
