#### [[Conceptual note is a better term than atomic note]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Names matter because they effect people's perception and understanding]], and 
I think that in name alone [[conceptual notes]] are superior to atomic notes. 
The name atomic notes pushes you to think about the physical size of the note,
instead of the intellectual size of the note.

At first thought (unless you're a chemist), an atom is a uniformly sized building block.
It can vary a little bit in size, but overall it's virtue is in its uniformity.
In [[Niklas Luhmann]]'s original [[Zettelkasten]], he inscribed all notes on 3x5 cards
and then laid them out to create larger thoughts. 
This system restricted notes to a single atomic size,
but in the era of computer's this process is different.
^[This doesn't mean there isn't anything to learn from Luhmann's system, but we shouldn't limit ourselves because of it: [[Better tools allow us to be less disciplined and more productive]]]
We no longer have the limitation of a small card that can easily fit into filing cabinets, and we no longer have access to the 3d plane.
Trying to exactly recreate a [[Zettelkasten]] with these limitations would
introduce unnecessary [[friction]]: [[Friction is the number one hindrance to learning]]

This is why I always say [[conceptual notes]] instead of atomic notes:
[[Concepts are the fundamental unit of knowledge]]
