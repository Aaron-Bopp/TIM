#### [[How to understand what you read]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Reading well or reading widely are not
how you read to understand, as
reading to understand mainly relies on doing things other than actual reading.
%%
Are you connecting what you are reading to past [[knowledge]]?
Are you just noticing connections or are you trying to fully understand them?
Are you questioning what you are reading based off critique or questioning your beliefs based on your reading?
%%

In order to get everything you can out of what you are reading:
- [[You need to remember what you read]]
- [[You need to teach yourself what you read]]
- [[You need to take what you read out of context]]

These things aren't hard to do but they are hard to do consistently and well.
The best way I have found to do these things is to make [[evergreen notes]] about what I am reading,
and then review those notes with [[spaced repetition]].
This process when done correctly will exemplify everything on [[Blooms taxonomy]].

For more specifics on how to do this:
- [[My TIM]] for understanding how I use [[evergreen notes]]
- [[Using spaced repetition for your conceptual notes]]
- [[Readwise Export for Obsidian - Templates and Process]]

There are also things you do to make the reading process better.
- [[Tips for concentration]]
- [[Use colors to create visual outlines]] 

If you don't already have a [[knowledge management]] system setup, but you already are doing a lot of reading. You may want to focus on just writing about what you read and not trying to do both at the same time. 
This is a good starting point: [How to read | Robert Heaton](https://robertheaton.com/2018/06/25/how-to-read/).
Once you start doing this you likely feel even more of a need to systemize your approach and because you have a starting point you will have context to build your [[second brain]].
