#### [[Deconstructing your faith is like climbing through a jungle canopy]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Deconstruction (Christianity)|Deconstructing]] your [[faith]] is very difficult, especially after being raised in the church. Getting out of it is like hacking your way to the top of a jungle canopy. You are often carrying tons of unneeded baggage, your blade might be dulled by many years on the jungle floor, and you might have people down there screaming at you for climbing. The hardest part is that you can't let go of your baggage or stop listening, until you get to the top. Even when you have reached thetop, you can't even enjoy the fresh air because you have grown so used to the suffocating humidity of the jungle.

The reason that deconstruction feels this way is because,
[[Working through trauma can involve of a lot of letting go]],
or because [[Sometimes we can't grow until we change our environment]]

[[Faith can be a useful tool for grounding yourself]], because christianity answers [[The three main questions of life]].
Because Christianity is often taught from childhood, [^1] it can be very hard to comprehend a world without a plan, without a creator, and without purpose.
[[There aren't any downsides to working through trauma]], but that doesn't mean that we will not feel lost and confused. [[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]], so deconstructing your faith is a direct attack on the [[ego]]: [[Faith is an abstraction of cognitive dissonance]]

[^1]: [[Religious concepts are often too powerful for a child's mind]]
