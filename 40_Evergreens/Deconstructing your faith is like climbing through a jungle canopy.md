#### [[Deconstructing your faith is like climbing through a jungle canopy]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Deconstruction (Christianity)]] is very difficult especially after being raised in the church. Getting out of it is like hacking your way to the top of a jungle canopy. You are often carrying years of emotional baggage, your blade might be dulled by many years on the jungle floor, and you might have many people calling you to climb back down. The hardest part is that you can't let go of your baggage or stop listening and until you get to the top. Even when you have reached the top you can't even enjoy the fresh air because you have grown so used to the suffocating humidity of the jungle.

Perhaps the reason that deconstruction feels this way is because,
[[Working through trauma can involve of a lot of letting go]],
or because [[Deconstructing your faith can feel like constructing a puzzle that you haven't seen before]].

Because Christianity is often taught from childhood, [^1] it can be very hard to comprehend a world without a plan, without a creator, and without purpose. Christianity answers [[The three main questions of life]], and losing those can feel like loosing your [[self]]. [[There aren't any downsides to working through trauma]], but that doesn't mean that we will not feel lost and confused. [[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]], so deconstructing your faith is a direct attack on the [[subconscious|ego]]: [[Faith is an abstraction of cognitive dissonance]]

[^1]: [[Religious concepts are often too powerful for a child's mind]]
