#### [[Religion as a collection of beliefs]]

In:: [[The materialistic view of religions examines why humans invented and clung to religion]],
when [[religion|religions]] are created or "discovered" they immediately try to make some fusion of current religious beliefs and then claim that their specific collection is the most accurate.
Over time, they will also absorb popular beliefs from other religions as they convert people.
This shows how [[Worldviews should be open ended and adaptive]] is applicable even in religions that aren't inherently accepting. ^8036d0

We can see this 
displayed in:: [[Christianity has many sources other than the Bible]].
Christian's claim [[The bible is god breathed]] and yet follow a variety of pagan beliefs.

Even when there are claims of divine inspiration,
those beliefs have some explanation, either as reactions to current negative behavior's or reinforcements of positive behaviors.
[[Religion promotes high social control]], and thus the collective beliefs are usually followed more closely now than they were before. 
This can mean that the origin's of those beliefs can be lost as they are completely overshadowed by the religion's use of them.

This explains [[Religious claims of absolute truth are always insubstantiable]],
as any absolute truth is only based off of truths that came before it.
