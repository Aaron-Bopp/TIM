#### [[What are the different kinds of information in books]] 

- The "did you know this?"'s
- the "what does this mean?"'s
- the "how does this work"'s
- and fluff

- part of:: [[How to understand what you read]]

Similarly different kind of information in [[note writing]]
- [[source notes]] are what other people know
- [[topic notes]] are what I know about what other people know
- [[evergreen notes]] are what I know about what I know

From the reader's perspective information can be classified into six different types based on how much of it we already know and how broad it's subject matter is.
