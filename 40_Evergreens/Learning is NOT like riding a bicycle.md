#### [[Learning is NOT like riding a bicycle]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Or at least if it was we would never have to relearn anything.

Riding a bicycle is something that humans are (roughly) built to do, in that our brain evolved for millions of years in order to have motor-cognitive skills advanced enough to be able to ride a bike.
It did this through muscle memory, a memory much stronger than our cognitive memory.
Now we still learn to ride a bicycle,
but unlike learning calculus or the distance to moon,
we are biologically less likely to forget it.
Muscle memory was absolutely vital to our survival for millions of years, so we evolved to be incredible good at it.
Then about 300,000 years ago we decided to become conscious and learn things without actually doing them.
^[This in of itself is a skill that we teach to our children, i.e. teaching someone how to spell with a pen in hand vs telling them]


We did not evolve for 100 million years to learn calculus.
[[Humans have had little time to adjust to being the top predator]]
The ability to learn is a **by-product** of [[human evolution]],
but it is not the main goal.
[[The ultimate goal of the mind is to keep thinking]]
and by keep thinking I mean by whatever means possible.
[[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]]
