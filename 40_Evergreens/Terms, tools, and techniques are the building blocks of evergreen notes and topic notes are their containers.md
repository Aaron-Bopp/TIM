#### [[Terms, tools, and techniques are the building blocks of evergreen notes and topic notes are their containers]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Term notes]], [[tool notes]], [[technique notes]]

- Terms: evergreen, source
	- definitions are atomic and change over time, but they can also be defined and have a source of truth
- Tools: source and topic
- Techniques: topic and evergreen 
- Writing/Output: evergreen, source, topic
- Evidence: atomic source notes (evergreen source)
	- Study show that x causes x does not change bcs the study already exists but is also atomic bcs it is a single peice of info.
	- term topic source
	- tools/tech: topic evergreen
	- terms and topics provide context around evergreens, (evergreens also provide context for evergreens) and evidence and source provide buildings blocks for evergreens, and evergreens are the produce... which would mean the major types are context notes and source notes, and the output is evergreen notes... evergreen vs atomic, are they all atomic, source definitly isn't, but evidence notes make sources more atomic.

?Is there really a difference between tools and techniques... a tool can be created and its effectiveness is defined by its output (code editor) a technique is about how quality of a product it makes.

A source note may be the starting place for all of these because when you are taking notes actively you will be writing down terms, making notes of techniques, and learning tools. 

Source note may be bad term because it is different than an actual source.


- Topics - contextual, broad
	- terms - any term can be become a topic if explored long enough, but for our uses most terms can be included in there larger topics, nevertheless a term not can easily converted into a topic not by adding at outline
		- creating a term: term needs definition and links to topics, if there are no proper topics that term should sit under or term is bigger than topics it should be topic note
		- why note just create topic notes? its overwhelming to look at everything as infinitely explorable (despite the truth of that statement)
		- why write terms? helps reduce friction, forget to add to outline but term is already in note, term definition is easily at hand in your own words without leaving your writing space
	- outline/topics for the purpose of writing - more specific in purpose and scope than proper nouns topics, but still contains thought, closer to atomic evergreen 
		- ex: [[My Deconstruction journey]], [[Ronald Reagan invented modern conservatism]]
	- tools/techniques - every technique is a tool, every tools uses techniques, a technique broadly defined is a topic (ie meditation) but not when closely defined (ie deep breathing) but both still cover many concepts/have many effects. a tool can contain many smaller atomic peices (writing a for loop in python, writing a while loop in python)
		- ex: [[meditation]], [[C (programming language)]]
	- atomic
	- automatically linkable
	- Defin your terms, set you rmedium, prepare you rmind
- Evergreens
	- atomic
	- api-like, specific imperative titles
	- provide context for eachother get structure from topic notes
- Source notes
	- building blocks
		- theres a blury line between building off of evergreens vs building off of source notes. For some areas citing sources isn't important and others it is. If I read something and then write about it a week later im not gonna cite it, and then I will build off that written evergreen.
	- broad source specific not concept specific
