#### [[The triad of ever increasing social anxiety]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

So you're trying to be more [[socialization|social]] and you know:
1. [[A secure identity is the best defense against social anxiety]] but you don't have a secure identity because 
2. [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]] so you have no way of treating this anxiety which leads to [[social discomfort]] 
3. Which weakens your identity because [[Identity is your understanding of yourself vs your interaction with the world]] 
4. Which leads to a lack of secure identity, and the [[feedback loop]] repeats.

The only way out of this is loop is [[self-actualization]], and spending too much time in this loop can lead to [[Sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion|The fallacy that sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion]] or repressing your identity even further: [[A repressed identity creates a mistrust of self-love and self-esteem]]

#TO/TEND/REFACTOR these notes [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do#Cause repressed identity]], [[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]]
