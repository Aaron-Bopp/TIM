#### [[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Once the [[ego]] has internalized a [[belief]] as true it will work very hard to keep that view from being challenged because [[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]]. 
Even though this is one of the reasons for [[human advancement]],
it can be detrimental. 

Fundamentally this will lead to [[cognitive dissonance]] as we are unable to integrate new [[information]], but it also causes us to invent reasoning to explain our beliefs because
[[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things]].
This
explains:: [[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]].

Thankfully, we have a path out of this. If our initial beliefs are ones that allow for new information, we defend that position just as hard as one that cannot integrate new information.
%% #TO/PONDER/IDEA is this true? %%

Through this trait we can see the foundation for human's reliance on and love of [[belief]].
