Once the [[ego]] has internalized a [[belief]] as true it will work very hard to keep that view from being challenged because [[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]], but fundamentally this produces [[cognitive dissonance]] as we are unable to integrate new information.
^[[[Evergreen notes should be constantly integrating new knowledge]]]
#TO/PONDER/SOCIETY What pushes us to break this process?

#TO/TEND/MULCH 
The fundamental [[Neuroscience|neurological]] process behind this is [[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]]
As we ask, [[What is the cognitive effect of living in an unjust world]], this is a big part of how we push ourselves forward. [[Our brains are built around survival]], and being able to combat the [[cognitive dissonance]] of life is important. We cannot observe the answers to the [[The three main questions of life]], so we have to have some [[belief systems|belief system]] in order to continue on.

- [[religion]] #TO/TEND/GRAFT 
	- [[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things]]
	- [[The materialistic view of religions examines why humans invented and clung to religion]]
	- [[Faith is an abstraction of cognitive dissonance]]
	- [[Better tools allow us to be less disciplined and more productive]]
	- [[Faith can be a useful tool for grounding yourself]]

Even though this is one of the reasons for [[human advancement]],
^[[[Does cognitive dissonance increase your capacity for endurance]]]
it can be detrimental. 
^[[[Is cognitive dissonance the reason for harmful behaviors]]]
It can make it hard to accept knew information because of this and because [[We are confined to the tools of our time]]. [[Knowledge of the world is painful]], but we should [[Be the change you want to see in the world]]. Try not to get stuck in [[pessimism]] and believe [[Sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion]], because [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]]
