#### [[How can something be adaptive and net bad]]

While in theory [[natural selection]] optimizes for anything that increases survival, often this just means more. More genes, more offspring, more influence. We can see that this often leads to something being selected not because it actually makes people's live better, but because it optimizes for more genes in the gene pool.
We can see this in [[human evolution]] in [[Farming outcompeted foraging by allowing for higher populations]]. Farming actually lowered people's quality of life quite a bit, but because there were so many more people in won out of [[foraging]] ([[Foraging was a very sustainable lifestyle]])

Another example is in primates, killing the young of other males in the group.
This could bring ire from others in the group either towards you or your offspring, but it does increase your chance of breeding and getting your genes into the gene pool in the meantime.

%% You could even imagine the opposite result of [[WW2]]. If instead more people had banded behind the Nazis instead of the allies and they had one it would have been a form of natural selection and a net bad for the world. %%
