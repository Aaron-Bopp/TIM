#### [[Fear is the number one hindrance to trying]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

> I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”
