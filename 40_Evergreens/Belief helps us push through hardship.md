#### [[Belief helps us push through hardship]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This is 
enabled by:: [[Belief can motivate adaptation]] 
and is 
part of:: [[A secure worldview is the best defense against existential dread]]

> ![[books_The Anthropocene Reviewed#288175131q]]

#TO/TEND/GRAFT 
- [[Does cognitive dissonance increase your capacity for endurance]]
- contrasts:: [[Sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion]]
	- This contradicts this, you believe that there is not hope so you go nowhere, maybe it's that [[Belief reinforces your worldview]]
- [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]]
- why:: [[Worldviews should be open ended and adaptive]]
	- you can be pulled into being an oppressor i.e [[Christianity]]
- part of:: [[The materialistic view of religions examines why humans invented and clung to religion]]

As opposed to dragging you back in life like the [[mind]] often does: 
[[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]

- contrasts:: [[Anger fuels change]]
- [[Bhakti Yoga]]
- results in:: [[Be the change you want to see in the world]]
- how:: [[Faith can be a useful tool for grounding yourself]]
