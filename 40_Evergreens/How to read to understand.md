#### [[How to read to understand]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]] and [[Use spaced repetition as a memory tool for your second brain]]. Is the only way to truly understand what you read through repeated exposure? #TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH  [[mnemonic medium]]

A large part of [[understanding]] is remembering. If you can remember past [[knowledge]] you can build upon it and develop a deep understanding of any subject you can put your mind to.
Luckily there are countless strategy's for remembering.

Once you have moved past the basic implementation's of [[spaced repetition]] and summary, you may still feel yourself unable to grasp concepts and well as you would like. This is likely because you are not engaging with the subject as deeply as you think you are.
Just reading and book and even reading a book and remembering it, are not how you become a leading expert in the a field, 
and thus not how you read to understand.
Reading to understand almost undoubtedly relies mainly on things other than actual reading.
Are you connecting what you are reading to past [[knowledge]]?
Are you you just noticing connections or are you trying to fully understand them?
Are you questioning what you are reading based of critique or questioning your beliefs based on your reading?

To understand and to remember is to learn, but the book is not teaching you, the author is not teaching you, [[spaced repetition]] is not teaching, you are teaching yourself. You need to be working with the content and giving yourself homework. Write prompts and research questions for yourself. You even need to be creating new thought about what you read. Any insight that you can find original or not is vital to your understanding
