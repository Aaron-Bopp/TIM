#### [[How to read to understand]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]] and [[Use spaced repetition as a memory tool for your second brain]]. Is the only way to truly understand what you read through repeated exposure? #TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH  [[mnemonic medium]]

Answers:
- [[You need to take what you read out of context]]
- [[You need to remember what you read]]
Just reading and book and even reading a book and remembering it, are not how you become a leading expert in the a field, 
and thus not how you read to understand.
Reading to understand almost undoubtedly relies mainly on things other than actual reading.
Are you connecting what you are reading to past [[knowledge]]?
Are you you just noticing connections or are you trying to fully understand them?
Are you questioning what you are reading based of critique or questioning your beliefs based on your reading?
