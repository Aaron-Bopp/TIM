#### [[Time is a valuable mode in a second brain]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[A healthy second brain requires a surplus of entry points]] talks about how we should have many ways to enter our [[second brain]], and one of those entry points can be time. Whether this is time that something was created, modified, or needs to be looked at again. 

My **#created** tag is part of this, as I can use it to easily see how many notes I have made in a month day, year etc. I could access this [[information]] through a script, but this ease of access is far more valuable and template is [[EGNOTE|rather simple]].
