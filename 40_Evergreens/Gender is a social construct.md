#### [[Gender is a social construct]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Current discussion of [[gender roles]], [[Patriarchy]], [[feminism]], [[sexism]] often revolve around the emphasis of this in our culture over the last 200 years, but the social construction of gender is a process that began before we split from chimps. A [[social construct]] does not have to be recent, rather it is our intuitive understanding of how our [[Evolutionary Psychology]] impacts our [[Behavioral Psychology]] to produce our understanding of [[socialization]], or in this case [[gender schema]].

[[Our understanding of gender begins at a very early age|We experience gender at an early age]], and through behaviors like [[gender segregation]]
^[[[Gender segregation increases gendered play]]]
 and [[Gender self-socialization model|gender self-socialization]]
^[[[Trans children will repress their dysphoria if they have been effectively taught it is unacceptable]]]
we develop a [[gender schema]].  But despite these strong roots for our gender, we still observe that [[Gender has historically been non-binary]] and [[Biology supports the validity of trans people]].

##### Why is [[gender]] such a debated topic in recent [[history]]?

The answer is unfortunately in [[Politics]], and the [[Rise of Modern Conservatism]].
[[Transgender]] people have been demonized in our [[society]], and [[religion|religious]] fundamentalism has caused endless [[childhood]] [[trauma]]: [[Non-faith issues have been co-opted to keep people in the Christian church]]

Especially within the last thirty years, trans [[activism|activists]] have built support for the [[Queer]] [[community]], and pushed doctors and the government to support treatment for [[gender dysphoria]]. They have advocated that [[Any experience of gender is acceptable]] and improved the lives of trans people, but as these beliefs have become more main stream they have received backlash.

The prominence of the [[gender binary]] in our [[socialization]], the politicization of [[gender]], and the fact [[Every person has an experience of gender]], means that a lot of personal and systemic [[privilege]] comes with being [[cis|cisgender]]. 
^[[[You will never be pushed to understand marginalization unless you are part of a marginalized group]] talks about the [[ignorance]] that is inherent in being in the most [[privilege|privileged]] social group.]
Most people's [[gender schema]] does not allow for [[gender non-conformity]], and they implicitly understand that allowing for that will attack their place in the [[Patriarchy]].
^[[[Patriarchy convinces young men that they can and should be oppressors]]]
For this reason, [[transphobia]] is more prominent in men (see [[Masculinism]]) and [[religion|religious]] people, but unfortunately it has also invaded [[feminism|feminist]] spaces and created the phenomena of [[TERFS]].
