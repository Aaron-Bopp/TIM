#### [[Hope is not optimism it is a practice for producing change]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

> [[Optimism]] looks at the evidence to see whether it allows us to infer whether we can do X or Y. [[Hope]] says I don't give a damn I'm gonna do it anyway

Some people think that being angry prevents you from being optimistic, but [[Anger fuels change]] and [[True optimism is acknowledging the suffering of the world and defying it anyway]]

If you can find [[hope]] within yourself or within other people its all worth it.

On a personal level, [[Happiness is enlightenment and sadness is delusion]]. 
Even if you are [[suffering]], [[hope]] is the only path forward:
[[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]]
