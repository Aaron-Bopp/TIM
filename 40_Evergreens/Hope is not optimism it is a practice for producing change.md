#### [[Hope is not optimism it is a practice for producing change]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[What is the difference between optimism and hope]]

Some people think that being angry prevents you from being optimistic, but [[Anger fuels change]] and [[True optimism is acknowledging the suffering of the world and defying it anyway]]

> "Kaba states, “I always tell people, for me, hope doesn’t preclude feeling sadness or frustration or anger or any other emotion that makes total sense. Hope isn’t an emotion, you know? Hope is not optimism”

If you can find [[hope]] within yourself or within other people its all worth it

On a personal level, [[Happiness is enlightenment and sadness is delusion]]. 
Even if you are [[suffering]], [[hope]] is the only path forward:
[[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]]
