#### [[Evangelicalism has commodified faith for profit]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

#TO/DO/WRITE Analogy of ticket salesman and confused customer

While [[The brain is powerful enough to create supernatural experiences]], [[Christianity]] has commodified supernatural experiences for monetary gain. [[Capitalism]] has accelerated this and created the modern [[Evangelicalism|charismatic church]] services which are the perfect environments for [[dissociation]] and [[panic attacks]]. It's all powered by [[guilt]], legitimate belief in a all-powerful god, and often emotional [[trauma]], and lots and lots of money. This is why Charismatic church's are especially prone to [[religious trauma]]: [[Religious concepts are often too powerful for a child's mind]] 

- [[The Politicization of the Christian Church]] #TO/TEND/GRAFT 
	- [[People have been conditioned to believe the bible has to be infallible]]
	- [[Single issue voters are anti-democratic]]
		- [[Abortion and immigration are detrimental to white supremacy]]
	- [[The anti-vax movement is based off a white lie]]

Not every modern Christian practice is bad: [[Faith can be a useful tool for grounding yourself]], but 
[[The church will fail if christians keep aligning themselves with hate instead of love]]
