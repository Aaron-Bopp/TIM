#### [[Evangelicalism has commodified faith for profit]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Evangelicalism]] is like a crooked salesman. They scream and scream about how all you need to do is pray one little prayer and then your entire life will be changed.
"Have [[faith]] and you will be saved. [[belief|Believe]] in the lord god and he will make your pain go away. All you need is one little prayer and your life will be changed forever!"
But when people come back to the salesman because they believed and didn't have their pain go away or feel any change at all, they are told that they are the problem. 
"You should find it easy to be a good person because your a good Christian,
here say the prayer again!" 

[[The actual path to being a good person isn't explored by Evangelicalism]]

While [[The brain is powerful enough to create supernatural experiences]], [[Christianity]] has commodified supernatural experiences for monetary gain. [[Capitalism]] has accelerated this and created the modern [[Evangelicalism|charismatic church]] service which is the perfect environments for [[dissociation]] and [[panic attacks]]. It's all powered by [[guilt]], legitimate belief in a all-powerful god, and often emotional [[trauma]], and lots and lots of money. This is why Charismatic church's are especially prone to [[religious trauma]]: [[Religious concepts are often too powerful for a child's mind]] 

- [[The Politicization of the Christian Church]] #TO/TEND/GRAFT 
	- [[People have been conditioned to believe the bible has to be infallible]]
	- [[Single issue voters are anti-democratic]]
		- [[Abortion and immigration are detrimental to white supremacy]]
	- [[The anti-vax movement is based off a white lie]]

Not every modern Christian practice is bad: [[Faith can be a useful tool for grounding yourself]], but 
[[The church will fail if christians keep aligning themselves with hate instead of love]]
