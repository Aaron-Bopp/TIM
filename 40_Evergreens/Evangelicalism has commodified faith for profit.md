#### [[Evangelicalism has commodified faith for profit]] 

[[Evangelicalism]] is like a crooked salesman. They won't stop telling you how all you need to do is pray one little prayer will change your entire life until you walk away or give in.
"Have [[faith]] and you will be saved. [[belief|Believe]] in the lord god and he will make your pain go away. All you need is one little prayer and your life will be so much better!"
But when people come back to the salesman because they believed and didn't have their pain go away or feel any change at all, they are told that they are the problem. 
"You should find it easy to be a good person because your a good Christian,
here say the prayer again!" 

This is
why:: [[The actual path to being a good person isn't explored by Evangelicalism]].
[[Christianity]] has commodified supernatural experiences for monetary gain rather than for actually helping people lead better lives. 
^[ #TO/DO/CITE ]
While the roots of this can be seen back to the [[Catholic Church]],
[[Capitalism]] has accelerated this and created the modern [[Evangelicalism|charismatic church]] service, televangelists, and summer camp services with just enough smoke and repetitive singing to drive everyone into sensory overload.

[[The brain is powerful enough to create supernatural experiences]],
but these kinds of services are perfectly crafted to overload us enough to believe we are being filled with the spirit or our that our pain is healed.

This is 
part of:: [[The Politicization of the Christian Church]],
where [[Christianity|Christian]]'s faith has been taken advantage of to get a variety of leaders into office.

This is not to say that Christian's [[belief]] is unfounded, but you cannot ignore the way that [[Christianity]] has been twisted, see [[You can leave the church without loosing your faith]].
