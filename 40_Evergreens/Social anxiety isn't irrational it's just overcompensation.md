#### [[Social anxiety isn't irrational it's just overcompensation]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

People who say [[anxiety]] is irrational are just unaware of their surroundings,
or they will answer to their fears but not understand where they come from: [[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]]

For the most part [[anxiety]] is a completely natural and normal [[Neuroscience|neurological]] reaction, but it can extended into the realm of overcompensation by [[trauma]] (i.e. [[Rejection Sensitivity]]), [[neurodiversity]], or simply a warped sense of reality. 
^[Anxiety can be the [[manifestation]] of the [[cognitive dissonance]] that warps your [[perception]]: [[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things]]]

#TO/PONDER/CONCEPT of our brains believing that [[anxiety]] is real from [[notes_Anxiety 101]]
- [[Anxiety should be a tool at your disposal not an impedance to your life]]
- [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]]
- [[Our brains are built around survival]]
- [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]]
