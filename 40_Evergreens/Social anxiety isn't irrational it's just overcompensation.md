#### [[Social anxiety isn't irrational it's just overcompensation]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

People who say [[anxiety]] is irrational are just unaware of their surroundings. Or they will answer to their fears but not understand where they come from, [[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]]

For the most part [[anxiety]] is completely natural and normal [[Neuroscience|neurological]] reaction, but it can extended into the realm of overcompensation by [[trauma]] (i.e. [[Rejection Sensitivity]]), [[neurodiversity]], or simply a warped sense of reality.

- [[Anxiety should be a tool at your disposal not an impedance to your life]]
- [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]]
- [[How Neuroscience impacts our daily lives]]
- [[Our brains are built around survival]]
