#### [[Names matter because they effect people's perception and understanding]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

How something is named effects people's [[perception]] of it.

> [!example]
> In [[my TO(DO) and EVER(GREEN) structure]], I have classification's of seed, sprout, and green for note status. When I go to publish my vault, I have my script setup to not publish any seeds so that I could have content that isn't fully formed yet not be published automatically. If I wanted something to be published, I should update it's status to sprout. This was working fine, until I read a pursuading article about a seedbox. Now functionally, my sprout status is no different from their seeds, but the difference in naming has been bothering me, and has pursuaded me to change my script: [[Hard rules create cognitive bias]]

- [[Conceptual note is a better term than atomic note]]
- [[Trans people will look for any other solution than being trans]]
- [[How to pursue the positive things in life]]
- #TO/PONDER relation to [[cognitive dissonance]]
- [[Q justifies conservatives discontent]]
- [[American's are scared of the word communism not it's meaning]]
