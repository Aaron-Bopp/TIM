#### [[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]] 

People assume that if they are not being emotional then they are being rational, and that if someone is being emotional then they are being irrational.
If you are unable to feel your [[emotions]],
it is actually more likely that you are being irrational,
are your emotions are still likely [[subconscious|subconsciously]] effecting you,
and you are not accounting for that bias.
^[[[video_How logical thinking leads to irrationality]]]

part of:: [[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]]

The reasons that you cannot feel your emotions could come from a variety of places such [[Alexithymia]], [[Reciprocal inhibition]], or just being [[socialization|socialized]] to feel like your emotions are unacceptable,
but the stubbornness to refuse to admit that your are biased is 
explained by:: [[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]].
