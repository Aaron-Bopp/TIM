#### [[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

As children, we are often interrogated about our emotional state before we have the ability to understand for our emotions. This may be because our [[parents]] are unequipped to deal with our emotional needs or have not equipped us with proper [[coping-mechanisms]].[^1] Being able to explain the emotions you are publicly feeling will relieve the attention that you are receiving. This couples the reward of moving the attention away from oneself with the reward of "fixing" the emotion, but being able to explain what the emotion was (or lied about what it was[^2]) does not mean we have effectively dealt with the emotion. If this [[feedback loop]] continues, children can develop very strong [[defense-mechanisms]] around sharing their emotions.

[^1]: [[Parents need to model the ability to deal with emotion to their children]]
[^2]: [[Trans children will repress their dysphoria if they have been effectively taught it is unnaceptable]]

One manifestation of this defense mechanisms is: [[Avoidance IS the most-efficient way of dealing with emotion]]. Many people will find that they are only able to verbalize emotions that they have processed on their own first.
