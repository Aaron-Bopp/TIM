#### [[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

As children we are often interrogated about our emotional state before we have the ability to understand our emotions because we are making a scene or because our parents are unequipped to deal with our emotional needs ([[Parents need to model the ability to deal with emotion to their children]]). Being able to explain the emotions you are publicly feeling will relieve the attention that you are receiving. This couples the reward of moving the attention away from oneself with the reward of "fixing" the emotion, but being able to explain what the emotion was (or lied about what it was [[Trans children will repress their dysphoria if they have been effectively taught it is unnaceptable]]) does not mean we have effectively dealt with the emotion. This leads to a [[feedback loop]] and this rationalization pathway as a way to avoid emotions and leads to problems later in life. 

Because [[Avoidance IS the most-efficient way of dealing with emotion]], many people will find that they are only able to verbalize emotions that they have processed on their own first. This is can be an [[anxiety]] response to being constantly unable to properly share your emotions as a child.
