#### [[Stub notes are data structures for implicit knowledge gathering]] 

For me, making a [[stub notes|stub note]] is just making a small [[observation]] that something could be interesting. 
I may not look at that stub for months or years, 
but when I create that note I can see 
where the note has been linked,
and where it hasn't been linked.

Oftentimes creating a stub will illuminate just how much you mention a term, or will start to pull together notes on a graph, or maybe it will just allow you to use autocomplete. 

Like any data structure in a [[second brain]], stub notes are subject to [[The fragility of information in knowledge management]].
Overreliance on them can clutter up your vault, and without turning them into [[Term notes]], you may confuse two synonymous words for different concepts.
It is more important to understand why and how you are using stub notes. 
See, [[An experienced note taker knows how to work efficiently]].
