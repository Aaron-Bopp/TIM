#### [[Stub notes are data structures for implicit knowledge gathering]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

For me, making a stub note is just making a small [[observation]] that something could be interesting. 
I may not look that stub for months or years, 
but when I do I can see the day the note was created,
^[[[Time is a valuable mode in a second brain]]]
where the note has been linked,
and where it hasn't been linked.
The created date is valuable because [[Time is a valuable mode in a second brain]], and the other notes created at that time may give insight to why I created that stub.
The linked notes are valuable because they show where the note was at the top of my mind
^[this is reduced when you use autocompletion that doesn't rely on pressing \[\[]
and the unlinked show places where the relation to the stub could be a unique insight.
