#### [[Knowledge of an unjust world is painful]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This 
answers:: [[What is the cognitive effect of living in an unjust world]],
in not a behavioral but an observational way.
Even if humans react to this fact in a variety of different ways, we can at least acknowledge that it is true.

Our reaction to this fact could be one of these two things.
It either
leads to:: us thinking [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]] or [[Sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion]]

This is a big part of [[Accepting responsibility is not only about your actions]]. You must accept your part in the hurt of the world without crippling yourself.

Once you have realized this, you will realize [[You can't blame people for failing to rise above their circumstances]]
