#### [[Knowledge of an unjust world is painful]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

#TO/PONDER should this be renamed to knowledge of an **unjust** world is painful?

This is a big part of [[Accepting responsibility is not only about your actions]]. You must accept your part in the hurt of the world without crippling yourself.

Becoming obsessed/absorbed by this fact leads to thoughts like [[Sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion]]

Once you have realized this, you will realize [[You can't blame people for failing to rise above their circumstances]]

#TO/TEND/GRAFT 
- [[Christians struggle to feel empathy because they must believe that non-christians are going to hell]]
- [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]]
- contrasts:: [[Growing up is being able to articulate the hope more than the hopelessness]]
	- #TO/PONDER/IDEA connection/contrast with this and [[Humans have decided to reject an unjust world]], [[Humans have decided to take advantage of an unjust world]]
- contrasts:: [[Be the change you want to see in the world]]
- [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]]

- causes [[Sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion]]
