#### [[Medical treatment should be wholistic not prescriptive]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This does not mean that we should not be using medication to manage and treat [[mental illness]], but that [[medication]] should just be a tool and not the end all be all.

Most prescription medications like [[SSRI]]'s or [[Mirtazapine]] have side effects that can be just as impactful as their main effects. The job of the doctor is not just to prescribe the [[medication]] but to help the patient find a treatment plan that will most benefit their life.
^[[[notes_Treatment Principles for Anxiety and Depression]]]

Many people including people like [[Dr. K]] have made the observation that [[Drugs may be being overprescribed]].
This is 
part of:: [[There has been a decrease in mental health not an increase in mental illness]]
and how [[society]] and medical professionals have reacted to it.

We also know that things like, [[exercise]], [[human behavior|socializing]], and [[meditation]],
^[[[Meditation improves mental, physical, and emotional health]], [[Yoga is a wholistic philosophy of self-improvement]]]
all holistically improve your [[mental health]].
