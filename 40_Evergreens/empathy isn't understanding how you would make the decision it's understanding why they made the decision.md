#### [[Empathy isn't understanding how you would make the decision it's understanding why they made the decision]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`


People will often try to conceptualize how somebody made a choice and fail often because they think it is illogical or immoral, but they are trying to understand how they would make the decision not why the other person made the decision.
[[Having extreme and uncontrollable empathy is dangerous]], but
not being able to put yourself in someone else's shoes is a fault on your part.
^[[[Consciousness is our capacity to introspect]]]

[[You can't blame people for failing to rise above their circumstances]] because doing so means you cannot empathize with their position. 
[[Searching for THE answer is dangerous]] because your closing yourself off to [[understanding]].
This is why 
we should [[Look for understanding before you look for solutions]].
This [[emotional mirroring]] will help to bridge the gap of [[understanding]] between you an the other person. 

When entering in to this mindset it is important to remember 
[[Empathy does not disallow judgment]].

This idea is especially important for [[Christianity|christians]], because [[Christians struggle to feel empathy because they must believe that non-christians are going to hell]] because they struggle to put themselves into the shoe's of non-christians:
[[Worldviews should not make life seem easy and simple]]
