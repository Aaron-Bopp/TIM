#### [[Empathy isn't understanding how you would make the decision it's understanding why they made the decision]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

#TO/TEND/CONNECT [[Having extreme and uncontrollable empathy is dangerous]]

[[You can't blame people for failing to rise above their circumstances]] because doing so means you cannot empathize with their decision. People will often try to conceptualize how somebody made a choice and fail often because they think it is illogical or immoral, but they are trying to understand how they would make the decision not why the other person made the decision.

It's a lot easier to understand why somebody did something rather than twist and turn to understand how you could make it. [[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]] and [[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things]]. We believe that if we could make the decision it is right. It feels right to think this way but at the end of the day it only makes life more difficult.

When entering in to this mindset it is imporant to remember 
[[Empathy does not disallow judgment]].


This idea is especially important for [[Christianity|christians]], because [[Christians struggle to feel empathy because they must believe that non-christians are going to hell]] because they struggle to put themselves into the shoe's of non-christians.
