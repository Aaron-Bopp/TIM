#### [[Anxiety causes us to reject nuance]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Anxiety]] creates black and white thinking do to it's [[Neuroscience|neurological]] relation to the [[fight-or-flight response]].
^[[[notes_Anxiety 101]]]
This is part of how [[Our brains are built around survival]].

[[Anxiety stems from a lack of confidence for the future]].
Often people will seek out reassurance when [[anxiety|anxious]], but while that reassurance is helpful in the moment it doesn't hit at the root of the [[anxiety]]. As people's [[anxiety]] continues to manifest they will seek more and more reassurance, even though they have already received that reassurance. They won't be able to see that asking repeatedly is illogical, and when they stop receiving the continued assurance they will perceive it as rejection.
^[[[notes_Responses to Anxiety]]]

This becomes very dangerous when combined with
[[Your anxiety is telling you everything that could go wrong, not what will go wrong]], and
[[Most anxiety isn't irrational it's just overcompensation]].
Your [[anxiety]] is not only feeding you more information than you need,
it is information that has a seed of truth.
That is what makes [[anxiety]] so dangerous for our [[relationships]],
especially when there are other strong [[emotions]] 
^[and [[repressed]] [[emotions]] ([[Samskara]])]
at play:
[[Triggers are stored interactions that lead to strong emotional responses]]

This is especially worsened when those triggers lead to [[anxiety]] as 
[[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]] and
[[Our brain actively inhibits us from processing repressed emotions]].
