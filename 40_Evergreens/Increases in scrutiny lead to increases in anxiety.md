#### [[Increases in scrutiny lead to increases in anxiety]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Scrutiny]] increases and decreases throughout our life. 
We may be more sensitive to [[scrutiny]] at different points in our life like during puberty or a new job.
[[Social media]] increases our access to [[scrutiny]] and thus it increases our [[anxiety]]. 
[[Confidence is a feedback loop]] and an overly scrutinous environment can keep our [[confidence]] low even if our skill is high.

- plays into:: [[Social anxiety is a fear of social consequence]]
- leads to:: [[Self-hatred is born out of dissonance between self-image and self-perception]]
