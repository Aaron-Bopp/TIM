#### [[A second brain should mirror how we think]] 

> ![[articles_IA for PKM — Crows, Camels, Concepts, and the Cognitive Divide#^292190330]]

All thoughts are made up of the electrons connecting neurons. The path's between these neurons are strengthened through use and weakened by disuse, and through a [[web of thought]] create [[memory]].
^[[[How memory works]]]
The purpose of our [[second brain]] is to compliment and augment this process.
- [[Concepts are the fundamental unit of knowledge]] guides us in how to organize our knowledge
- [[Densely linked webs of thought provide intuitive access to knowledge]] guides us in how to access our knowledge
- [[Evergreen notes should be constantly integrating new knowledge]] guides us in how to keep on top of our knowledge

##### Nodes in the [[second brain]] are more fragile than thoughts in the first brain

In our first brain there is no such thing as "fragility" there is only [[learning]] and forgetting, but in the second brain learning doesn't happen on it's own and forgetting is impossible:
^[ #TO/PONDER/IDEA what is the impact of the second brain not being able to forget?]
[[Nodes in the second brain are made up of impermanent data and permanent metadata]]

The easiest way that we can surpass the first brain is *permanency.* Data can sit for 20 years on a hard drive and still be accessible, but unlike in our first brain, data will not grow over time:
[[The fragility of information in knowledge management]]

Much of [[knowledge management]] is centered around how to handle these problems: [[A healthy second brain requires a surplus of entry points]]

##### Counterpoint:: Nodes in second brain are whatever you make of them

You shouldn't ever take anybody's word in the [[knowledge management|PKM]] [[community]] as law, because you should [[Write your notes with a system not within a system]]. [[Choosing a note writing system is choosing a system for thought]], but [[When in doubt, write what you think]].

- [[A totally integrated machine should be infinitely scalable]]

##### Counterpoint:: your notes will never be a "second brain"

This is a opinion shared by [[newsletter.eleanorkonik.com|Eleanor Konik]] in this article [Obsidian is my Thinking Environment not my Second Brain](https://www.obsidianroundup.org/ite-not-second-brain/)

I latched onto the term [[second brain]] not as any concrete system, but as a lofty goal for how to configure my vault. My brain worked great, but every note system I had tried up to that point had actively worked against it. A second brain would reflect it, not recreate it

There are three types of [[knowledge]]:
- What other people know
- What you know other people know
- What you know

The only way we can learn is by transforming [[information]] from being what other people know, to what we know,
making this
part of:: [[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge]].
