#### [[A second brain should mirror how we think]] 

All thoughts are made up of the electrons connecting neurons. The path's between these neurons are strengthened through use and weakened by disuse, and through a [[web of thought]] create [[memory]].
^[[[How memory works]]]
The purpose of our [[second brain]] is to compliment and augment this process.
- [[Concepts are the fundamental unit of knowledge]] guides us in how to organize our knowledge
- [[Densely linked webs of thought provide intuitive access to knowledge]] guides us in how to access our knowledge
- [[Evergreen notes should be constantly integrating new knowledge]] guides us in how to keep on top of our knowledge

part of:: [[How do we work with a second brain]]

##### Counterpoint:: your notes will never be a "second brain"

This is a opinion shared by [[newsletter.eleanorkonik.com|Eleanor Konik]] in their article [Obsidian is my Thinking Environment not my Second Brain](https://www.obsidianroundup.org/ite-not-second-brain/).

I latched onto the term [[second brain]] not as any concrete system, but as a lofty goal for how to configure my vault. My brain worked great, but every note system I had tried up to that point had actively worked against it. A second brain would reflect it, not recreate it
