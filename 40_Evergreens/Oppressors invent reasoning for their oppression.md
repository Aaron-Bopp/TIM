#### [[Oppressors invent reasoning for their oppression]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This is 
because:: [[Hierarchy enables oppression]]
and oppressors need reasoning to justify and reinforce their [[hierarchy]].

> ![[books_Sapiens#^297681743]]

Once you have made your way to the top of a [[social order]] you know have two main prerogatives:
1. How do I maintain my spot at the top?
2. [[What maintains our social order]]

The most common way of doing this is to justify your [[hierarchy]] and thus oppression through 'natural law' or theological distinction.
^[[[books_Sapiens#^299110293]]]

We can see this in:
- [[Theology preserves hierarchy through deific blessing]]
- [[The caste system preserved hierarchy through purity]]
- [[Whiteness was created to marginalize people of color]]
