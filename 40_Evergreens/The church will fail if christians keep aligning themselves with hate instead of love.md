I honestly think that the only way that the church can continue to exist is through throwing out the sanctity of the bible and cherry-picking it.  Church membership is down 40% in the past 30 years and its only gonna keep going down
^[[U.S. Church Membership Falls Below Majority for First Time](https://news.gallup.com/poll/341963/church-membership-falls-below-majority-first-time.aspx)]

This is majorly due to [[The Politicization of the Christian Church]], but is also due to the inherent risk of such a [[Neuroscience|neurological]] powerful belief: 
[[Faith is an abstraction of cognitive dissonance]]
