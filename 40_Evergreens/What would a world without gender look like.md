#### [[What would a world without gender look like]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

- Can you do no gender and still have biological sex?
	- Sex is also a construct, a categorization of biological traits. You need to have motivation for the categorization to not be made
- Does it have to be asexual reproduction?
	- You could have the roles in sex change either threw multiple different ways of reproduction or from being able to change your sexual traits


- [[Gender is a social construct]]
