#### [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

#TO/TEND/CREATE this bridge note

Possibly an answer to [[What is the cognitive effect of living in an unjust world]]
- [[Evolutionary Psychology]]
	- [[Our brains are built around survival]]
	- [[The brain is powerful enough to create supernatural experiences]]
	- [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]]
		- [[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]]
- [[mental health]]
	- [[Trans children will repress their dysphoria if they have been effectively taught it is unacceptable]]
	- [[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]
		- [[A repressed identity creates a mistrust of self-love and self-esteem]]
		- [[Avoidance IS the most-efficient way of dealing with emotion]]
		- [[Social anxiety isn't irrational it's just overcompensation]]
	- [[How can parent's best help their children]]
		- [[Parents need to model the ability to deal with emotion to their children]]
		- [[Working through trauma can involve of a lot of letting go]]
- [[self]]
	- [[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]]
	- [[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]]
	- [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]]
 	
This is the basis for [[PTSD]], [[anxiety]], [[DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder)]]

This ability to pattern match is a major part of why we have survived as a species (and how we may evolve see [[neurodiversity]]). [[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things]].
