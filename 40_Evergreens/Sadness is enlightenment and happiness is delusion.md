#### [[Sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

If a person internalizes the narrative that negative emotions are a sign of intelligence, it can warp their [[realism|realistic]] [[perception]] of the world, because [[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]].

Once a person has set up this belief that negative emotion is associated with intelligence, you can struggle to find [[happiness]] in normal situations, and find it easy to find [[sadness]] in good situations. As your intelligence and [[knowledge]] of the world increases, you will find that the only "proper" reaction is increasing sadness. 

This way of living your life is [[subconscious|subconsciously]] attractive,
because you will think your increasing sadness is a sign of your increasing intelligence, and that it is the only moral reaction the world we live in.
As your [[despair]] grows, so does your [[fear]] of the possibility of [[hope]],
because then your [[realism|realistic]] view of the world is wrong,
and your despair has been for nothing. 

[[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]] and your anger against the [[injustice]] of the world has caused you to make [[rationalizations]] about how you can [[change]] it.
This [[feedback loop]] leads to inaction, [[depression]], [[pessimism]], and [[cynicism]].
^[[[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]]]

##### What is the path out?

Once someone has reached this state of "[[enlightenment]]," they will not only find it incredibly hard to be happy, they will see any [[happiness]] they do find as illogical, unnatural, and generally unwarranted, but [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]].

The path out will be different for every person, but for everybody some change is needed.
^[[[Sometimes we can't grow until we change our environment]]]

It may be something small, it may be something massive, or they may just get bored with being cynical and come to think [[Happiness is enlightenment and sadness is delusion]]. If someone can trick themselves to be hopeful, that may be enough to make a permanent change in their life, because [[Hope is not optimism it is a practice for producing change]].

- [[Purpose is derived from within, duty is derived from without]]
%% #TO/TEND/MULCH 
For people that have become to aware of [[What is the cognitive effect of living in an unjust world|The cognitive effect of living in an unjust world]], the only may be [[emotional detachment]] from the [[suffering]] of the world: [[Buddhism outlines a path and practice to end suffering, but does not promise it]]%%

[[Knowledge of an unjust world is painful]], but [[Accepting responsibility is not only about your actions]]: [[Be the change you want to see in the world]]
