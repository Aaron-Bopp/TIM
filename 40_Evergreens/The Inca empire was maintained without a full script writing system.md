#### [[The Inca empire was maintained without a full script writing system]] 

While the first [[writing]] system
^[[[Sumerians invented writing to store large amounts of data]]]
that we have record of
did eventually develop into a [[full script]],
some cultures have only needed [[partial script]]'s for their entire [[history]].

One example is the [[Inca Empire]], which at one point contained over 10 million people. They maintained all of their mathematical data in tied cords called [[quipus]]. This system was so effective that it caught the eye of their colonizer's...as something that threatened their power and need to be destroyed.

Example of:: [[Empires are born through conquest and maintained by bureaucracy]]

This 
works with:: [[Foraging was a very sustainable lifestyle]]
