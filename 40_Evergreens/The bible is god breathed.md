#### [[The bible is god breathed]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This is a belief held by protestant and [[Evangelicalism | evangelical]] church's. It holds a lot of power, and if you attempt to point out the way that it has warped [[Christianity]] you will receive a lot of backlash.

It's ironic because [[Are Jesus' teachings anti-thetical to the modern Christian church]]

It's a big part of the reason why I think [[The biblical Christian God is evil and does not deserve to be worshipped]] and that [[Searching for THE answer is dangerous]], the thought that the bible is infallible means there is a right answer for every question, and ignores many individual's experience's. ([[People have been conditioned to believe the bible has to be infallible]])

- counter [[The church will fail if christians keep aligning themselves with hate instead of love]]
