#### [[Is cognitive dissonance fundamental to the human experience]] 

Our brains are not designed for correcting the dissonance between thoughts and conclusions, this is 
why:: [[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things]].
Yet, [[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]].
We can see how these lead to [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]],
but does that make [[cognitive dissonance]] a fundamental, necessary, or good part of the [[human experience]]?

[[Is cognitive dissonance the reason for harmful behaviors]]?
It seems [[Yuval Noah Harari]] would think not:

These contradictions are solved through [[cognitive dissonance]] and fuel change in our [[society]].
