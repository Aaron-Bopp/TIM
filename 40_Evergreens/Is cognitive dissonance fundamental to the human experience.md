#### [[Is cognitive dissonance fundamental to the human experience]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Our brains are not designed for correcting the dissonance between thoughts and conclusions, this is 
why:: [[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things]].
Yet, [[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]].
We can see how these lead to [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]],
but does that make [[cognitive dissonance]] a fundamental, necessary, or good part of the [[human experience]]?

- [[Is cognitive dissonance the reason for harmful behaviors]]
- [[What is the cognitive effect of living in an unjust world]]
