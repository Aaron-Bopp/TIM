[[The history of meditation is a mixture of science and spirituality]]
[[Consciousness is our capacity to introspect]]

##### On a human level
When people meditate for a long time they feel their [[perception]] of the world change,
and more easily recognize what they need to do to succeed.
[[Meditation]] also helps people to focus and achieve things they are already trying to do: [[Meditation helps us gain control over our emotions]]

##### On a scientific level
[[Meditation helps us regulate our hormonal environment]] and [[Meditation helps us regulate our nervous system]]

##### On a [[spirituality|spiritual]] level

[[Consciousness is the fundamental unit of existence]] and because [[Meditation is a practice to develop a stronger conscious]] it helps us to [[manifestation|manifest]] our will upon the world.


[[conscious|consciousness]] is a skill and divinity is the goal... [[enlightenment]]?

This is [[Tantra]], [[manifestation]] of our will into the world.
