#### [[Most cultural differences are rooted in material differences]] 

Humans are incredibly similar biologically. Other than the variation that is inherent in our species, there isn't any part of sect of [[humanity]] that is fundamentally different than any other part. However, we do find statistically significant variation in different populations.
While there have been many explanations for these differences through [[history]], 
^[see [[What is the origin of social hierarchy]] for more]
the only real explanation we have for these differences are the opportunities and resources that are available to certain populations over time.

We can see this in the origin of whiteness.
[[Whiteness was originally a class distinction]]
but then because [[Once hierarchy is in place vested interests will keep it in place]]
over time is was justified
^[justified in the eyes of the oppressors: [[Oppressors invent reasoning for their oppression]]]
through various different frameworks.
