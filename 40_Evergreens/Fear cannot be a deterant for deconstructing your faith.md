#### [[Fear cannot be a deterant for deconstructing your faith]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

#TO/TEND/BRIDGE thoughts about the irrationality and [[cognitive dissonance]] of christians and [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]] ^5dc5d8

[[Fear of hell is baked into Christianity]] Another fear people have is fear of social consequences, especially the reaction of [[parents]] who have worked in or attended the church for a long time.

[[Deconstructing your faith is like climbing through a jungle canopy]], and often you can't view [[Christianity]] objectively until you reach the top. Depending on your level of [[indoctrination]] and your continued involvement in the church you may have a more objective view of the [[Christianity]] already, but I don't think you can get rid of the fear of hell, or the fear of [[judgement|judgment]], or the fear of "worldlyness" until you get to the top. 

Some people can never truly reach objectivity with [[Christianity]] because they have had legitimate spiritual experiences or have experienced a personal relationship with god. Despite the reality of these things, those experiences are very much real and are often the main reason people stay in the church: [[The brain is powerful enough to create supernatural experiences]]

If you can never get to this place of objectivity, you may get stuck feeling like you're [[Deconstructing your faith can feel like constructing a puzzle that you haven't seen before | constructing a puzzle you haven't seen before]]
