#### [[Foraging was a very sustainable lifestyle]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Foraging]] was the main mode of life for hundreds of millennia of [[human evolution]]. It wasn't until [[Farming outcompeted foraging by allowing for higher populations]] that it dropped from the top spot, and that mainly because [[Farming prevented a return to foraging for early humans]].

The three main aspects that made foraging sustainable were:
- [[Foraging kept populations down]]
- [[Foraging allowed for a diverse diet]]
- [[Foragers suffered less from disease]]

This meant that baring great natural disaster, an ecosystem with foragers in it would be stable possibly hundreds of thousands of years.

While the above traits allowed foragers to live at peace with the environment,
the social aspect of foraging's sustainability is also important.
[[There is a limit to the size of a group ordered purely by personal communication]]
and most bands of [[hunter-gatherers]] likely fell within this limit.
This means that the [[Imagined reality]] of the tribe could be easily shared by word of mouth.
[[Social order is built off of a shared belief in an imagined reality]], and 
[[Moral social control promotes pro-social behavior in groups]].

[[David Graeber]] would cite this as the strongest aspect of [[hunter-gatherers]] stability, as it is part of his definition of [[equality]]. 
^[[[What does equality even mean]]]
