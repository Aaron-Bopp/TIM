#### [[Human behavior is selective]] 


Many people hold human thought in a place above all other behavior in animal or computer kind,
but [[Intentionality is not separate from functionality]].
Just because we have [[consciousness]] and feelings of [[free will]],
does not mean that [[Humans are a product of evolution]] is false,
or that our thoughts are not the result of millennia of [[human evolution]].
In fact this only makes our behavior more rational,
as we can look to all elements of our environment,
and not just some hard to define [[qualia]],
for influences of [[human behavior]].

This is
explained by:: [[Evolution can create systems capable of natural selection]].
In a way human intentionality and decision making is the crown jewel of [[natural selection]], 
^[[[Natural selection is a designing agent]]]
working on an iteration of milliseconds vs generations.
It's evolution was key in [[Greater cooperation and communication has lead to the success of humans as a species]]
as our increased ability to process thought and select behavior based of it was key in allowing us to outcompete other species.

We can also apply this [[framework]] to [[unconscious]] thought, and see how this
explains:: [[Our brain actively inhibits us from processing repressed emotions]] and [[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]].
