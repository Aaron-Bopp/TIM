#### [[My Deconstruction journey]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

My deconstruction started in high school because of a general lack of [[love]] for the church. I didn't really get anything out of it, and I had kinda stopped trying to be a [[Christianity|christian]] after middle school. Part of the reason was I never had a spiritual experience even though I tried so hard. I basically felt like I deserved it and because I didn't get it I stopped trying. Even if I had gotten one I 100% believe that if you try hard enough and believe hard enough [[The brain is powerful enough to create supernatural experiences]] 

I was disconnected from my [[faith]] enough that I was able to stop being a [[Christianity|christian]], before I decided that God wasn't real, and I wasn't really afraid of [[Deconstruction (Christianity)| deconstructing]] my [[faith]] because I only valued the church to please [[my parents]] ([[Fear cannot be a deterant for deconstructing your faith]]) I still practiced [[Christianity]] (christian school, going to church, etc) until I was 19, because I was too scared of [[my parents]] reactions. I lied for four years straight, for really no benefit because I forced myself to live a lie for years and when I did tell them it was still [[religious trauma| traumatic]]. 

It took me two years of complete separation from the church and [[my parents]] on top of four years of not being a [[Christianity|christian]] before I felt like I could look at [[Christianity]] objectively, because [[Deconstructing your faith is like climbing through a jungle canopy]]. It was only when I was able to reach the top that I made the realizations about God ([[The biblical christian God is evil and does not deserve to be worshipped]]) that made me confident enough to be an [[atheism|atheist]].

One of my most major issues with the church is that [[Non-faith issues have been co-opted to keep people in the christian church]]. This is part of the reason why I believe [[You can leave the church and still believe in the christian god]], and why [[My worldview is not about conversion it is about acceptance]]. But I think it is also very important to note [[The church will fail if christians keep aligning themselves with hate instead of love]].

Despite all that I still think [[Faith can be a useful tool for grounding yourself]]. I had multiple existential crises' after leaving the church because I had no [[worldview]] and had no [[purpose]].  [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]], and our worldview is what protects us from the unknowable. [^1]  [[Identity is your understanding of yourself vs your interaction with the world]], and when you completely deconstruct your understanding of the world, you can lose track of your [[self]].

##### How has my worldview evolved since leaving the church?

I went through a time of [[depression]], where fell into the fallacy that [[Sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion]], because I was really struggling with realizing the injustice of the world[^2] and with forgiving my [[parents]]. [^3] As part of my [[self-actualization]], I started to forgive my parents: [[Children in traumatic households expect more love than their parents can give|Parents will not be able to protect their children from every source of trauma]].

[[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]]

My feelings being a follower of Jesus have somewhat mellowed with time, but my feelings towards the church has not, and I still believe [[The biblical christian God is evil and does not deserve to be worshipped]]

Additionally I believe [[Worldviews are wrong if they make life seem easy and simple]] and that [[Christianity]] is one such worldview:
-  [[Christians struggle to feel empathy because they must believe that non-christians are going to hell]] creates a [[cognitive dissonance]] that is unhealthy
-  [[A inwardly judgementful and outwardly accepting home creates trust issues]]
-  [[The actual work of being a good person isn't explored by Christianity]]
-  [[You will never be pushed to understand marginalization unless you are part of a marginalized group]]

I have started to look other belief systems to contrast them to [[Christianity]]:
[[The materialistic view of religions examines why humans invented and clung to religion]], but we still see religions like [[Bhuddism]] that do not focus on salvation. [[Bhuddism outlines a path and practice to end suffering, but does not promise it]].
