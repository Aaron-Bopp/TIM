#### [[What is the difference between a evergreen note and a topic note]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

A [[evergreen notes]] is a singular thought and a [[topic note]] is a singular idea. An [[evergreen notes|evergreen note]] should be able to be linked several places as it's thought is small enough to be free of context.

A [[topic note]] is a much broader concept that is made up of many smaller thoughts. It is a collection and abstraction of those thoughts both for access and for organization. It's power is in it's generality (how easily it can be found where it was not directly linked)
