#### [[Trans people will look for any other solution than being trans]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

- result of:: [[Self-repression is the most natural response for trans people in strongly gendered environments]]
- leads to:: [[Why representation in media is important]]

#TO/PONDER/IDEA This note title is really more about the societal reasons it's difficult to come out, but the note is more about what coming out will do.

#TO/TEND/MULCH 
[[Gender is both an intrinsic experience and a necessary expression]], many [[Transgender people|trans]] people will recognize the effects of [[gender dysphoria]] before they recognize the cause.
[[Trans children will repress their dysphoria if they have been effectively taught it is unacceptable]]
Once you discover and accept yourself as [[Transgender people|trans]], a lot of the seemingly inexplicable or untreatable [[mental illness|mental illness]] in your life will be alleviated as well.
^[[[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]] and [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do#Cause repressed identity]]]
Despite being a transformational internal [[experience]], it can often be hard to accept yourself as [[Transgender people|trans]]. [^2] This leads [[Transgender people|trans]] people often continue to look into other solutions. This is often due to [[societal trauma | societal stigma]] and can make the life of an out or closeted [[Transgender people|trans]] person even more difficult.

- [ ] #TO/PONDER/IDEA Relation to studies from [[course_Psychology of Race and Gender]]%%

[^1]: [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]], [[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]]
[^2]: [[You're never sure if you're trans]]

[[Transgender people|Trans]] people will also sometimes experience a heightening of their [[gender dysphoria]] once they have come out to themselves. This is often because a dull, an unrelenting pain that you couldn't identify as the source of is now pointed at specific aspects of your life. Transitioning is often the only or most effective way of dealing with these feelings.
