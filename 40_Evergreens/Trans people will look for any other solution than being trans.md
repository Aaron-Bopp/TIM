#### [[Trans people will look for any other solution than being trans]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Because [[Our understanding of gender begins at a very early age]] and [[Gender is both an intrinsic experience and a necessary expression]], many [[transgender|trans]] people will recognize the effects of [[gender dysphoria]] before they recognize the cause: [[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]] 

Once you discover and accept yourself as [[transgender|trans]], a lot of the seemingly inexplicable or untreatable [[mental illness|mental illness]] in your life will be alleviated as well. [^1] Despite being a transformational internal experience, it can often be hard to accept yourself as [[transgender|trans]]. [^2] This leads [[transgender|trans]] people often continue to look into other solutions. This is often due to [[societal trauma | societal stigma]] and can make the life of an out or closeted [[transgender|trans]] person even more difficult.

[^1]: [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]], [[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]]
[^2]: [[You're never sure if you're trans]]

[[transgender|Trans]] people will also sometimes experience a heightening of their [[gender dysphoria]] once they have come out to themselves. This is often because a dull, an unrelenting pain that you couldn't identify as the source of is now pointed at specific aspects of your life. Transitioning is often the only or most effective way of dealing with these feelings.
