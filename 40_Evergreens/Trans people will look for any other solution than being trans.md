#### [[Trans people will look for any other solution than being trans]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Because [[Any experience of gender dysphoria is acceptable]] and [[Gender is both an intrinsic experience and an necessary expression]], many [[transgender|trans]] people will recognize the effects of [[gender dysphoria]] before they recognize the cause. [[The scientific basis of gender]] and [[Mental illness is a reaction to ones environment]], so often there will be many comorbid [[mental disorders]] that can be treated, when your transness and the chemical imbalances in your brain are the root cause. 

Once you discover and accept yourself as [[transgender|trans]], a lot of the seemingly inexplicable or untreated [[mental disorders|mental illness]] in your life will be alleviated as well. Despite an often transformational experience, it can often be hard to accept yourself as [[transgender|trans]] ([[You're never sure if you're trans]]) leading to [[transgender|trans]] people often continuing to look into other solutions. This is often due to [[societal trauma | societal stigma]] and can make the life of an out or closeted [[transgender|trans]] person even more difficult. 

[[transgender|Trans]] people will also sometimes experience a heightening of their [[gender dysphoria]] once they have come out to themselves. This is often because a dull an unrelenting pain that you couldn't identify to the source of is now pointed at specific aspects of your life. Transitioning is often the only or most effective way of dealing with these feelings.
