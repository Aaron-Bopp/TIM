#### [[my TO(DO) and EVER(GREEN) structure]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This structure could be applied to any system, but it works best in [[Obsidian (software)|Obsidian]], or other systems that treats tags the same way. In Obsidian tags can filter backlinks, the graph view, and be used with many plugins. Additionally when used in search queries they surface and filter notes. This makes tags useful as both a classifier of note type, and a way to mark work items: [[Use Obsidian tags as temporal classifiers]]

These structures work best when they are accompanied by a [[spaced repetition]] system aid in the upkeep and accuracy of these tags: [[Use spaced repetition to weed your digital garden]]

##### \#TO(DO)

**\#TO** tags should be used for specific items, not general tasks like "review notes" or "write this paper." This means they are a not daily todo list, they are a way to specify a task inline to to be done in the future. These tags should be temporary, but they are not scheduled. Think of these less as task you need to complete, and more as post it notes to remind you of something you wanted to do. It will also be frivolous to try and clean up all your tags, because acting on my of these tags should often result *in more tags...* This is because the goal isn't to finish your tags, it is to gradually increase the quality of your notes over time. 

The hierarchical structure lets me focus in when I have specific kinds of things I want to do, or look broader when I just have some time to work on my vault. 
This is an incomplete list, and new categories can be added whenever it feels necessary. 

- **\#TO**
    - **\#TO/TEND** tasks relating to [[evergreen notes]] that do not require leaving [[Obsidian (software)|Obsidian]]
	    - **\#TO/TEND/GRAFT** Formalize or conceptualize a connection
	    - **\#TO/TEND/PRUNE** Cut of parts that are outside the concept
	    - **\#TO/TEND/WEED** Fix syntax errors
	- **\#TO/DO** 
		- **\#TO/DO/WRITE** write a specific item, not used for need to write or expand an evergreen note
		- **\#TO/DO/PROGRAM** 
		- **\#TO/DO/REFERENCE** the source is there but unreferenced
		- **\#TO/DO/FIND** remember source but don't have easy access
	- **\#TO/EXPLORE**
		- **\#TO/EXPLORE/READ** 
		- **\#TO/EXPLORE/WATCH**
		- **\#TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH** 
	- **\#TO/PONDER** ideas or concepts that require deep thought or time to process
		- **\#TO/PONDER/ME** 
		- **\#TO/PONDER/SOCIETY**

##### \#EVER(GREEN)

This is the status field in my notes. The purpose behind this status is to be an intentional classification of how developed the note is. In the past I had a much more complicated system, that tried to combine both this classification and what my intentions were. 
^[See the previous version of this structure here [[Ever(green)structure until 2022-01-14]]]
This is system still does this, but on a much less granular level. 

These first three refer primarily to how developed the note is, but also come with the idea that I do not have any current intention of working on them. This means that any ideas that I have for them should be marked with \#TO tags.
- **\#EVER/SEED** these notes may only have a couple sentences or a few links.
- **\#EVER/SPROUT** these notes a body that fleshes out their core concept, but may not have a lot of notes linking to them
- **\#EVER/GREEN** these are notes that cover their concept well and interlink with the other notes

These statuses are much more focused on what my current intentions are for the note. As the number of notes I have grows, I need a way to prioritize notes in a way that I will actually use. The main downfall of my last system was the it was far to complicated to maintain, and so I never used it. 

- **\#EVER/WEED** notes that have content that I am not happy with, these are filtered out from my publish vault
- **\#EVER/GROWING** notes that I am actively working on, should be around 50
