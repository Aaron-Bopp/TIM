#### [[Christians struggle to feel empathy because they must believe that non-christians are going to hell]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

One of the core belief's of [[Christianity]] is that we have [[free-will]]. This is important for a couple of reasons, we must have the [[free-will]] to choose God's [[love]], and we must have the [[free-will]] to choose to sin. This is the basis of the genesis story and our "sin nature." This belief is also the main reason [[Fear of hell is baked into Christianity for vulnerable believers]]. Hell is allowed to be such a horrible place because you choose to be in it by refusing god's grace. 
^[This is a very complicated relationship, #TO/PONDER relationship with [[Do we have free will]]]

Because [[free-will]] is so integral to loving god and avoiding punishment, it becomes a core part of the [[Christianity |Christian]] [[worldview]], and when they see a non-believer they [[subconscious |subconsciously]] know that person has made the choice to go to hell and judge them for it.
^[this is why [[Worldviews are wrong if they make life seem easy and simple]]]
This plays a large part in the drive for evangelism and mission work, but it also changes [[Christianity|Christian]]'s relationships with others. 

If Christian's were feeling [[empathy]] fully for these people that would receive eternal punishment
they wouldn't be able to go on,
they wouldn't be able to do anything but evangelize or praise god for allowing them to be spared.
Christians will find endless rationalizations around why this is something they can accept,
because 
[[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things]].
How can you love someone you know is condemned to death? How can you bear to live in a world where some people will suffer eternally? How can you bear it? This is the [[cognitive dissonance]] that [[Christianity]] causes: [[Faith is an abstraction of cognitive dissonance]]

[[Empathy isn't understanding how you would make the decision it's understanding why they made the decision]], 
but [[Christianity|Christians]] are blocked from that understanding and by the impossible rules of their [[faith]]:
[[Hard rules create cognitive bias]]
