#### [[What is the origin of religion]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Prior to [[Emile Durkheim]] [[Animism]] and [[Naturism]] where the foremost theories of the origin of religion.
Durkheim's main argument was that these theories were not adaptive enough to be a 
result of:: [[Humans are a product of evolution]]

Durkheim states that 
broadly [[religious belief]] itself is not adaptive due to the way it misrepresents the world but that [[Religion creates social order through group membership and ritual]].

This separates the origin of religion from the origin of [[belief]]. This distinction is important in modern times as religious people often associate lack of [[religious belief]] as [[nihilism]], but [[belief]] in atheists can be just as strong. 
^[[[Atheists don't lack belief they lack religious belief]]]


In [[Darwin's Cathedral by David Sloan Wilson]], [[religion]] is discussed through the lense of [[Evolution]], and Wilson lays out these explanations for religion.

Religion as adaptive:
- A group-level adaptation [[Religion creates social order through group membership and ritual]]
- An individual level adaptation [[Religion is a rational bid for supernatural reward]]
- A cultural parasite that takes advantage of humans [[Evangelicalism has commodified faith for profit]]

Religion as non-adaptive
- as a [[spandrel]] of [[Belief can motivate adaptation]]
- Religious belief based of observation such as [[Animism]] and [[Naturism]] that is no longer adaptive in a modern environment.
	- They viewed the complexity of the world and assumed their must be a designing agent. They weren't wrong: [[Natural selection is a designing agent]]
