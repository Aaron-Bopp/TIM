- [[Insecure material conditions increase cognitive load and reduce outcomes]]
- [[Stereotypes are beliefs, prejudices are feelings, and discrimination is treatment towards a group a member of group]]
- [[Stereotyping has the psychological goal of comprehension and self-enhancement]]

- [[The Politicization of the Christian Church]]
- [[Christians struggle to feel empathy because they must believe that non-christians are going to hell]]
- [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]]
