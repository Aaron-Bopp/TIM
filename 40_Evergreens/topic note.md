#### [[topic note]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`
- [ ] #TO/TEND/DEOBFUSCATE [[Terms, tools, and techniques are the building blocks of evergreen notes and topic notes are their containers]]

Topic notes are a kind of note in a [[web of thought]]/[[knowledge management]]/[[Zettlekassen]] system.

A topic note is an order of magnitude larger than a [[evergreen notes]] or [[evergreen notes]]. If a [[evergreen notes]] is a singular thought, then a topic note is an idea or collection of related thoughts. A topic note should contain description of what falls under that topic and an outline of various other notes (of any kind) that fall under it. A topic note is note required to be inclusive, but maintaining topic notes is an important element in curating the knowledge in your [[second brain]]

Topic notes should be able to form naturally from your other notes so they should be titled however they would be naturally written. It should be titled as `Firstname Lastname` for a person,`ACRONYM` for and acronym, in singular form, and as simply as possible i.e `[[second brain]]` instead of `The [[Second Brain]]`.  ^eaec77

A topic note can come to be in two ways:
1. In the creation of an outline for a topic I would like to writing about
2. Through repeated mentions in other notes
