#### [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Our brains are built around survival]], it is that [[Evolution|evolutionary]] fact that has brought us here today, and has built two fundamental human traits: [[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things]] and [[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]]. These two traits alone have led us to create [[religion|religions]], [^1] start wars, explain reality, and explore the stars.

[^1]: [[The materialistic view of religions examines why humans invented and clung to religion]] and [[The brain is powerful enough to create supernatural experiences]]

These traits are what push us to survive beyond all odds, thus making them heavily reinforced by [[natural selection]]. This makes [[cognitive dissonance]] a fundamental part of being human. Whether it is the belief that the creator exists, [^1] the belief that your political party is fundamentally superior,[^2] or just the belief that life is worth living[^3] human's unrelenting push to survive relies on this fact.

[^2]: [[natural selection|kin selection]], [[Q justifies conservatives discontent]]
[^3]: [[True optimism is acknowledging the suffering of the world and defying it anyway]]

These traits are not purely positive. As human's, we are necessarily predisposed to assume that our existence makes sense. This is a fundamental fact behind [[human advancement]], and pattern recoginition is one of the main things that set us apart from other species, but we are far more subject to our environments than we think. Much of human [[suffering]] has been the fulfillment of these behaviors in the hands of people with power, and on an individual level, the stubborness that these produce warps our [[self-image]] and [[self-perception]].[^4]  

- [[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]]
- [[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]]
- [[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]]
- [[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]

[^4]: [[Self-hatred is born out of dissonance between self-image and self-perception]]
