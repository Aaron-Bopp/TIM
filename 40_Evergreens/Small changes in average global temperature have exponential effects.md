#### [[Small changes in average global temperature have exponential effects]]

As humans, we can tolerate temporary temperature changes of a few degrees pretty easily, it's only when we have to spend a long time in extremes that we start to struggle to maintain [[homeostasis]].
The [[earth]] isn't the same.

The range of temperature between our last ice age and crocodiles in the artic is only 10c, and any one degree shift is taking us between 16 and 25% towards a completely different world. For the warmer world we are expecting, this means catastrophic effects for farmers and wildlife.
