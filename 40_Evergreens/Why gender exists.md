#### [[Why gender exists]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

The gender segregation effect is the way that children seperate themselves into male and female groups by gender, and has been ovserved across multiple different cultures with varying levels of gendered socialization. One possible root is boy's affinity for more energetic play, and girl's affinity for more social play. Children will encourage gendered behaviors in eachother when in grouped, but children playing alone have minimal gender differences. I was a pretty anti-social child, and bad at sports so I didn't really take part in much peer play.
