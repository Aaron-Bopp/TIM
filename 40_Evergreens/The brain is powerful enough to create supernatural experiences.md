#### [[The brain is powerful enough to create supernatural experiences]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

The brain is powerful enough and complex enough to bring about a spiritual experience. This is observable fact and the effect of many pychadelic drugs, and is important to the [[human experience]], as are the [[religion]]s that these events normally lead to.

In churches, prayer is basically [[meditation]], modern [[Evangelicalism | charismatic church]] services are the perfect environments for [[dissociation]] and [[panic attacks]], and it's all powered by [[guilt]], legitimate belief in a all-powerful god, and often emotional [[trauma]]. This is why charismatic church's are especially prone to [[religious trauma]]

What does this mean for the bible? Moses could have seen a burning bush. Why not?
