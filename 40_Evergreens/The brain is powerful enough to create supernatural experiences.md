#### [[The brain is powerful enough to create supernatural experiences]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

The brain is powerful enough and complex enough to bring about a spiritual experience. This is observable fact and the effect of many pychadelic drugs, and is rooted in [[biology]]. [[Neuroscience]] can offer some explanations, and the factors also contribute [[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things]], and how [[Our brains are built around survival]]. Supernatural experiences could just be our bodies way of explaining something so that we can move on a survive, e.g [[What is the cognitive effect of living in a unjust world]]

These experiences have often been core to [[human advancement]] and [[self-actualization]], resulting in [[religion]] and [[enlightenment]].

While supernatural experiences are rooted in our [[Psychology]], [[Christianity]] has commodified supernatural experiences of monetary gain. [[capitalism]] accelerated this and created the modern [[Evangelicalism | charismatic church]] which's services are the perfect environments for [[dissociation]] and [[panic attacks]], and it's all powered by [[guilt]], legitimate belief in a all-powerful god, and often emotional [[trauma]]. This is why charismatic church's are especially prone to [[religious trauma]]

Prayer is basically [[meditation]] which has been shown to bring about supernatural experiences. This is one aspect of [[religion]] that has mostly positive impacts.

What does this mean for the bible? Moses could have seen a burning bush. Why not?
