#### [[Meditation helps us regulate our hormonal environment]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

20 minutes of [[meditation]] every day or every other day will impact your [[stress]] physiology through turning off your [[Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal (HPA) Axis]] which reduces [[Cortisol]]: 
^[[[notes_Science of Meditation]]]
[[Our brains are built around survival]], and will regularly produce [[hormone|hormones]] to produce a higher chance of survival.
^[This is because [[Humans are a product of evolution]]]

This is how [[meditation]] could affect [[ADHD]]. [[ADHD is not a lack of attention it is a misplacement of attention]]
