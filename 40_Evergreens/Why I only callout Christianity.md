#### [[Why I only callout Christianity]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Because I know a lot about it and it has had a massive impact on my life. I believe I have gained the right to call out as much as I want, and if Christians are uncomfortable with that then they can leave.

While other [[religion]]s may have problematic histories as well, I am not aware of them or at least not to the point where I would make a statement on it. When I talk about [[eastern philosophy]], I do so in the spirit of [[Use philosophies as far they are useful and nothing more]]. I am going to take whatever positives I can, and if something clashes with my [[morality]] I am just not going to use it. This is really how I use [[Christianity]] but there this process involved a lot of unlearning, and I have documented most of that in this vault.

Now feel free to read [[My Deconstruction journey]]
