#### [[Meditation is a practice to gain control over your thoughts]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

When [[Western philosophy|western]] researcher's started studying the science behind [[meditation]] and [[Yoga]] they tried to distill these practices into one thing:  [[mindfulness]]
^[[[notes_History of Meditation]]]

There are many different styles of [[Yoga]], but at the core of all of the them is [[understanding]] and controlling your [[mind]] so that we can better live in the current moment.
[[Consciousness is our capacity to introspect]]
and [[Meditation is a practice to develop a stronger conscious]],
so it follows that
[[meditation]] will help you gain control over your thoughts in a variety of different ways.

In [[Vedic Psychology]], the [[mind]] is divided into five layers, and understanding how these layers work together was key for how the [[Yogi|Yogis]] developed and refined [[meditation]].
^[[[The history of meditation is a mixture of science and spirituality]]]
These five layers of the [[brain]] interact to create [[conscious|consciousness]].
This allows us to process information from our [[Indriya|sensory organs]] and [[unconscious]], and to observe the intellectual [[mind]] and [[ego]].
Because [[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]], a practice that improves our awareness of our internal environment is going to be very impactful:
[[Meditation helps us gain awareness through detachment]]

Modern science has shown that these ancient practices have very powerful [[Neuroscience|neurological]] mechanisms in the [[brain]], and the [[meditation]] can have powerful impacts on our [[mental health]]. 
^[[[notes_Science of Meditation]]]
Gaining control over your thoughts does not merely lie in the [[brain]] as there are many [[physiology|physiological]] mechanisms that impact this. 
[[Meditation improves mental, physical, and emotional health]], but 
[[Yoga]] combines [[meditation]] with [[discipline]] and practices that are enhanced and can enhance [[meditation]]:
[[Yoga is a wholistic philosophy of self-improvement]]
