includes:: [[Buddhism outlines a path and practice to end suffering, but does not promise it]]

This doesn't contradict
[[Religion as a collection of beliefs]]
or 
[[Religion as a group level adaptation]]

involves answering:: [[How do we avoid suffering]]

in practice [[Happiness is enlightenment and sadness is delusion]]

In a way this bridge the gaps between traditional religions and [[natural-law religions]]
