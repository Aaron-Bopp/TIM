#### [[How do we effect change in society]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

First we have to ask how this
ties into:: [[What maintains our social order]],
so that we can understand what causes change and what prevents change.


Individual action may be a part of this i.e. [[Be the change you want to see in the world]],
but [[Greater cooperation and communication has lead to the success of humans as a species]].
If we want to effect change in [[society]] we need to work together as a [[community]]. 

%%
If our goal is [[equality]] or [[equity]], we need to ask
[[In what way are human's equal]],
[[What does equality even mean]]
%%
