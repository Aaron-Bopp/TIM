#### [[How do we effect change in society]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

First we have to ask how this
ties into:: [[What maintains our social order]]

Individual action may be a part of this i.e. [[Be the change you want to see in the world]]

If our goal is [[equality]] or [[equity]], we need to ask
[[In what way are human's equal]],
[[What does equality even mean]]
