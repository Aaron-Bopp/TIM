#### [[How do we effect change in society]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

First we have to ask [[What maintains our social order]]

- [[Be the change you want to see in the world]]
- [[Right kinds of thoughts lead to right kinds of actions]]
- [[You can't fix everything]]
- [[You can't control what happens]]

If our goal is [[equality]] or [[equity]], we need to ask
[[In what way are human's equal]],
[[What equality even mean]]
