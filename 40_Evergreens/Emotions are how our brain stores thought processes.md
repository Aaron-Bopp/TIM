#### [[Emotions are how our brain stores thought processes]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

That trigger is a symbolization of all your past fears

- explains:: [[Triggers activate stored emotional responses for certain situations]]
	- why::[[Our brain actively inhibits us from processing repressed emotions]]
- part of:: [[How memory works]]
- contrasts:: [[Complex emotions are imperfect understandings of primal urges]], because those are genetic processes not cognitive processes that lead to [[emotions]]

or perhaps more accurately they are how we store strings of sensory inputs
aka [[Samskara]]s
