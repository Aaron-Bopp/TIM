#### [[Distinguish between purposeful tagging and coincidental tagging of information]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

In systems like [[Obsidian (software)|Obsidian]]  it can be very easy to link to topics whenever they appear in text, as many people will use [[bi-directional links]] to [[topic note|topic notes]] as tags for content.
^[Obsidian also has a more traditional looking tag system, but it lacks the flexibility that notes provide, see [[Use Obsidian tags as temporal classifiers]]]
Additionally, some use autocompletion that will suggest linking those notes as they appear, which can make it easier to link a topic than to not. 
This can be seen as a counter-example to [[Friction is the number one hindrance to learning]], as in this case the lack of [[friction]] actually inhibits directly engaging with whether this note should be tagged with that topic.

This is where [[Note structures should help curate knowledge]] comes in. Having a section of the note for purposeful tagging, allows you to have more granularity in the ways that [[topic note|topic notes]] are linked. This is why you see a **Topics** field at the bottom of each of my [[evergreen notes]].

- [[Nodes in the second brain are made up of impermanent data and permanent metadata]]
