#### [[Depression is past focused, hopelessness is future focused]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Congruent Depression]] comes from observing your life up to this point and being disappointed.
[[Hopelessness]] is giving up on your own ability to affect your life.

- [[Hope is not optimism it is a practice for producing change]]
- [[You can't control what happens]]
- [[The most reliable path to success is repeatedly trying to succeed]]
