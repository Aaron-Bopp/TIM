#### [[Take note of the simple things in life]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Sometimes this means *savoring* the end of a **really good laugh.**  
Sometimes this means *taking a breath* when you notice how **beautiful** the sunset is.  
Sometimes this means letting your chest get **uncomfortably warm** eating soup on a cold day.  
Sometimes this means *literally taking a note* on something that you like.
Sometimes this means **laughing** at yourself instead of **cursing** yourself when you mess up for the third time that day.  
Sometimes this means finally *taking the piece of advise* your friend has given to you a million times.

- [[Be the change you want to see in the world]]
- [[How to pursue the positive things in life]]
