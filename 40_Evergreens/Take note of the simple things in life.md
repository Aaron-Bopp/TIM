#### [[Take note of the simple things in life]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Sometimes this means taking a breath when you notice how beautiful the sunset.  
Sometimes this means savoring the end of a really good laugh.  
Sometimes this means letting your chest get uncomfortably warm eating soup on a cold day.  
Sometimes this means literally taking a note on something you find interesting.  
Sometimes this means laughing at yourself instead of cursing yourself when you mess something up for the third time that day.  
Sometimes this means finally taking the piece of advise your friend has given to you a million times.

[[Be the change you want to see in the world]]
