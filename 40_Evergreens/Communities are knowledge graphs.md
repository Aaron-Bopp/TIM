#### [[Communities are knowledge graphs]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

When I first started looking for a [[note writing]] system, I did what anybody would do, I googled "Best note-taking apps 2021." Of course, I immediately stumbled upon an article that listed [[Notion]] as the highest and then [[Evernote]], [[Bear]], and [[Typora]], [^1] but then I scrolled to the bottom half of the list and saw an interesting app called [[Roam Research]]. This is where I was first introduced to the concept of [[bi-directional links]] and the idea of a knowledge graph. I ended up using Roam for about a month, and during that time I started to get hooked into the [[knowledge management|personal knowledge management]] community. I started seeing articles that mentioned [[Zettlekassen]] or talked about how life changing "How to take smart notes" was. I said to myself, "I think I'm going to have to look into those." As I started to read more about [[Zettlekassen]], I saw [[Obsidian (software)|Obsidian]] pop up more and more, and eventually stumbled accross [[Bryan Jenks]]' YouTube channel. This is where I really dove in, downloaded [[Obsidian (software)|Obsidian]] and started really creating a [[web of thought]]. I started crafting my own system based off of everything that I was reading, tweaking and expanding it to my liking, until I finally stumbled up [[Andy Matuschak's Evergreen Notes]]. As I started to read [[Andy Matuschak|Andy's]] [[philosophy]], I realized that this is exactly the system that I had been designing. At the time, I was a little taken aback to see everything that I had been dreaming up so accurately reflected in [[evergreen notes]], but I now realize that I had been *implicitely* learning Andy's system through the knowledge graph of the PKM community. 

[^1]: I remeber spending three hours fiddling with Notion buttons to create a bullet-journal system (when I had never even used bullet journal)

All it took was one node that linked into the graph for me to start crawling the [[web of thought]]. I read about things upstream and downstream of [[evergreen notes]] and implicitely learned that concept. This is the power of the knowledge graph. It expands your learning by placing thoughts in context. [^2] That context can be used to help you learn concepts better, but you can also start to learn context indirectly: [[Obsidian's graph is useful in the implicit and dynamic relations it can reveal]]
