#### [[Use colors to create visual outlines]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This is especially effective in academic research papers, as they will usually contain consistent types and structures of information. Here is mine:
- Claims: Yellow
- Conclusions: Blue
- Supports hypothesis: Green
- Undermines hypothesis: Red
- Methods: Purple

This is also very helpful when reading books. For fiction I use different colors for different themes, but for non-fiction I do something similar to research papers.
- Yellow (or the default color): Things I agree with without persuasion
- Blue: Supports that general thesis of the book 
- Orange: Outside information or verifiable information
- Magenta: Personally interesting me
