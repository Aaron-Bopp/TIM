#### [[The audience's perception is more important than the artist's intention]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

I think many artist's realize this, refusing to give insight into their thought process while creating art or what they expect to be taken from their art e.g. [[Donald Glover]] after *[This Is America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYOjWnS4cMY)*. 
^[[Donald Glover Doesn't Want To Explain "This is America" Music Video](https://youtu.be/SLL6gpy00WE?t=137)]

The impact that art can have on the audience is so much greater if each audience member can have a unique reaction. 
If the artist prescribes the audience's reaction they are losing out on so much impact.

I think that a lot of people look to the artist for a interpretation because they think that other people are not giving the art the reverence it deserves, or they just don't like how other people view the are they like. 
I think this is lazy, you are appealing to authority, rather than adapting to this other opinion.
