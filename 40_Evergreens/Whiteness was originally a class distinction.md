#### [[Whiteness was originally a class distinction]] 

The pseudoscientific and religious justifications of race can long after the real reason that there was a desire to draw a line between white people and black people, which was slavery. 
While there were slaves of every skin color,
because of the [[transatlantic slave trade]]
in the early America's most slaves were black. 
At the same time,
early laws in [[America]] were being founded [[Christianity|Christian]] and 
[[liberal humanism|liberal]] values. 
Among other things this lead to a desire to have a 
reason to justify slavery other than [[religion]] 
(as enslaved people could be converted to Christianity)
and so they turned to the color of their skin.
