#### [[Presentation is the realization of our self-perception and identity is the realization of our self-image]] 

Presentation is what we show to the world, it is our hair, style, the way we walk, the way we talk. For many it is a performance, for some it is a burden, and for most it is simply the way of life. 
[[Identity is your understanding of yourself vs your interaction with the world]].
[[Identity]] is who we are behind our [[ego]], behind our fears, it is everything we could want to be, we must simply unlock it.

[[Identity]] can inform your traits and behaviors, but it can also be disconnected from them (sometimes by choice or sometimes by force).  
Ideally your [[identity]] is fully instep with your [[self-image]] and your presentation is fully in step with your [[self-perception]], but this is not always the case,
and unfortunately
[[Self-hatred is born out of dissonance between self-image and self-perception]].
