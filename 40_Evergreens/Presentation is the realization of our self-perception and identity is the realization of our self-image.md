#### [[Presentation is the realization of our self-perception and identity is the realization of our self-image]] 

Presentation is what we show to the world, it is our hair, style, the way we walk, the way we talk. For many it is a performance, for some it is a burden, and for most it is simply the way of life. Identity can inform your traits and behaviors, but it can also be disconnected from them (sometimes by choice or sometimes by force).  Ideally your [[identity]] is fully instep with your [[self-image]] and your presentation is fully in step with your [[self-perception]], but this is not always the case: 
[[Self-hatred is born out of dissonance between self-image and self-perception]]

[[Identity]] is who we are behind our [[ego]], behind our fears, it is everything we could want to be, we must simply unlock it.
- [[A secure identity is the best defense against social anxiety]]
- [[A repressed self creates a mistrust of self-love and self-esteem]]
