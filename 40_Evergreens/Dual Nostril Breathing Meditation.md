#### [[Dual Nostril Breathing Meditation]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Examples:: https://youtu.be/sXGhT4pJcj8?t=7801
- When you meditate and drift off/lose focus what is the part of your mind that is pulling it back?
- The ability to observe is divine. It is not good or evil, it is that which notices everything else

[[Meditation is a practice and discipline of observation]]
