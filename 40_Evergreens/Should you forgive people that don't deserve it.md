#### [[Should you forgive people that don't deserve it]] 

Probably, if you should then 
[[When should you forgive people who don't deserve it]]

I think the main crux of the question is on how can you judge somebody as undeserving of [[forgiveness]]?
This gets into questions of [[morality]] and [[judgement]] 
and while it is often intuitive, 
this brings into question [[What is the difference between blame and judgement]].
