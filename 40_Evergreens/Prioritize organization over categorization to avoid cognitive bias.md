#### [[Prioritize organization over categorization to avoid cognitive bias]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

#TO/PONDER/IDEA porous concepts can be obfuscated if you have too much categorization [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/710585052769157141/916313872531603486)

##### This will cause you to waste energy

It can be tempting to try to categorize all the [[knowledge]] that you are gathering in your [[second brain]], but over-categorization can lead to wasting time on categorizations that in the end will be inaccurate. 
Try to create [[topic note|topic notes]] when you are overwhelmed, and stop creating them when you start feeling confined, or start categorizing things just to categorize them. Topic notes should be a boon to accessing your knowledge, not a distractor: [[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge]]

It is easier to cutout sections of large topics notes and create subtopics, than it is to have to recategorize a swath of notes.
