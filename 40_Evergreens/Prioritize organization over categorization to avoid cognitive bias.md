#### [[Prioritize organization over categorization to avoid cognitive bias]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

> When you think in categories, you underestimate how different two facts are when they fall in the same category. When you think in categories, you overestimate how different they are when there happens to be a boundary in between them. And when you pay attention to categorical boundaries, you don't see big pictures. Now, what our goal in this class is going to be is think about this big, complex issue of the biology of behavior without falling into thinking in categories.
