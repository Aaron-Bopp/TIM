#### [[Cultural evolution is not confined to the slow process of genetic evolution]] 

> It is unfortunate that [[evolution]] is so often associated with genetic evolution, a slow process that gives the impression of an incapacity for change over the time scales that matter most to living people struggling with their problems.

Through [[Cultural Evolution]] we can look at [[human behavior]] through the lens of [[Evolution]]. 
While this is just another [[Most problems cannot be significantly understood through a single framework|framework for us to use]], 
it can provide accurate prediction and help us to understand the complex problems of group dynamics from on a worldwide and historical scale.

It is easy to see how much faster [[Cultural Evolution]] can move when we look at it's fundamental unit of change, the cultural mutation.

Compared to the generational unit of change of [[genetic evolution]], [[belief]] can be passed almost instantaneously, which
leads to:: [[Social order is built off of a shared belief in an imagined reality]]

This is
part of:: [[Greater cooperation and communication has lead to the success of humans as a species]].
