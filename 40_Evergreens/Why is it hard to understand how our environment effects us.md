Why can't we realize that we live in an [[imagined order]]?

This is a question posed in [[Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari|Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari]], that closely 
ties into:: [[What enables large scale social order]]
and plays a 
part of:: [[Do we have free will]]

Harari's answer is:
![[Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari#^dd0325]]

Other possible reasons:
- We are indoctrinated
- We can't objectively observe what we are a part of
- We want to believe 
- We are materially affected by this [[social order]]
- We want to change this [[social order]]?
- The fact that it is imagined doesn't change anything about it

I think that in modern times we have for the most part realized that we live in a [[Imagined order]] except perhaps for christians? It seems like this question is a lot more meaningful when contrasted with the long held belief in a "[[natural law]]" or natural order. These days we have mainly come to the conclusion that our [[social order]] is imagined, but we are still trying to figure out
