#### [[There aren't any downsides to working through trauma]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]], working through your negative emotions will not change you fundamentally because negative effects are more influential than positive. Those negative effects suppressed parts of you and positive parts are the ones that made it through.  

Working through [[trauma]] will not fundamentally change you, but we cannot look at world where so many people are affected by [[trauma]] and think that once everybody is healed we will all be the same, because [[Working through trauma can involve of a lot of letting go]]. Thankfully working through [[trauma]] will only allow people to more accurately express and become their true selves.
