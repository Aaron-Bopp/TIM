#### [[There aren't any downsides to working through trauma]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

As we work through trauma, it can often feel like we are losing so much of what makes us *[[self|us]]*. There can be many factors for this. Maybe you are cutting out toxic behaviors. Maybe you are ripping away the [[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats|insecurities that most protect you]]. Or maybe you are loving yourself more and hating your self less. What you are actually feeling is the chipping away of [[childhood]] [[trauma]]. [[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]. These wounds have been major factors in our lives, but they have been major negative factors. Once we can heal our childhood wounds, we will be left with the things that we have pursued time and time again, because [[Negative influences are stronger than positive influences]]. Additionally, we can now pursue things that we never would have considered before, because [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]].

However, we cannot look at a world where so many people are affected by [[trauma]] and think that once everybody is healed we will all be the same. [[Working through trauma can involve of a lot of letting go]] and some of these things may feel like a downside, but I think in the end working through will always be positive.

Additionally this does not mean that working through trauma will not be hard, or that everything in your life will become perfect over night. [[Accepting responsibility is not only about your actions]], and sometimes that means forgiving people that don't deserve forgiveness. [[Children in traumatic households expect more love than their parents can give]]
