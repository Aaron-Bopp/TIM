#### [[What is the difference between sympathy and empathy]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Many people misunderstand empathy as feeling what the other person is feeling, and sympathy as feeling bad for the person. If you are feeling what somebody is feeling purely because they are feeling it, that is unhealthy. True empathy is not a blind taking on of emotion, it is putting yourself in that person's shoes and understanding what is causing those feelings. Sympathy may be a reaction to empathy, but you can also empathize with someone without having sympathy for them: [[Empathy does not dissallow judgment]]

Sympathy is the perception, understanding, and reaction to the distress or need of another life form. According to David Hume, this sympathetic concern is driven by a switch in viewpoint from a personal perspective to the perspective of another group or individual who is in need. Hume explained that this is the case because "the minds of all men are similar in their feelings and operations" and that "the motion of one communicates itself to the rest" so that as affectations readily pass from one to another, they beget corresponding movements.
