#### [[Flat Earthers refuse evidence that science is reliable]]

The most charitable interpretation of [[Flat Earthers]] is that they are engaging in an extreme version of [[empiricism]], [[Zeteticism]]. Meaning that their belief is a flat earth is the result of being unable to observe a round earth with their own senses.
This is a common argument when confronting [[Flat Earthers]]. They will claim that because neither of you have personally performed experiments proving one way or another, you can't draw conclusions. 

The counterargument to this is that personal observation that the earth is round or flat is not the only kind of evidence we have.
We have evidence and understanding how society and science works and this is first-hand evidence for why the world would be round.
