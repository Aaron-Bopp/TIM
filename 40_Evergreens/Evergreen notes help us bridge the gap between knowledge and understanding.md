#### [[Evergreen notes help us bridge the gap between knowledge and understanding]] 

There is an initial hump to [[understanding]] any concept that makes it hard to passively learn things.
This has given people the impressions that the only way they can learn is through a structured and purposeful attacking of the problem.
This isn't untrue, but there are ways that we can cross that hump without doing all the work at once.

[[Understanding]] helps our [[knowledge]] degrade less quickly. 
If we understand how [[information]] is derived and predicted,
when we eventually forget it, we will be able to substitute for it by understanding the process that caused it to happen. 
This doesn't just mean recalculating or rememorizing, it means developing an intuition for how systems work so that when eventually do forget it comes back exponentially quicker.

#TO/TEND/GRAFT 
- [[How to understand what you read]]
- [[Writing is a catalyst of understanding]]

Another problem is that we are continually falling back across the hump.
[[Learning is NOT like riding a bicycle]],
if we aren't actively working with something, we are going to forget it.
This is a gift and a curse.
With our memory we are constantly taking in new information and forgetting unneeded information,
but with our notes we need to substitute for this with the hard work of 
[[Evergreen notes should be updated over time]].
There are many ways to do this including, 
[[Spaced repetition helps you keep on top of your notes]],
but in this end there is no substitute for putting time and effort into our notes.
Thankfully, [[Productivity tools are often most useful in how much work they inspire you to do]]
and [[evergreen notes]] are usually addictive to work with.
