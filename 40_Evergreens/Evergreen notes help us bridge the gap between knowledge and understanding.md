#### [[Evergreen notes help us bridge the gap between knowledge and understanding]] 

part of:: [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]] 
explained by:: [[We learn by transforming information into understanding]]

There is an initial hump to understanding any concept that makes it hard to passively learn things.
This has given people the impressions that the only way they can learn is through a structured and purposeful attacking of the problem.
This isn't untrue, but there are ways that we can cross that hump without doing all the work at once.

Understanding helps our knowledge degrade less quickly. 
If we understand how some piece of information is derived,
when we eventually forget it, we will be able to substitute for it by understanding the process that caused it to happen.

- [[How to understand what you read]]
- [[Writing is a catalyst of understanding]]

Another problem is that we are continually falling back across the hump.
[[Learning is NOT like riding a bicycle]].
If we aren't actively working with something, we are going to forget it.
This is a gift and a curse.
With our memory we are constantly taking in new information and forgetting unneeded information,
but with our notes we need to substitute for this with the hard work of 
[[Evergreen notes should be updated over time]].
Thankfully, [[Productivity tools are often most useful in how much work they inspire you to do]]
and evergreen notes are usually addictive to work on because
[[Humans are addicted to understanding]].
