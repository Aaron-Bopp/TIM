#### [[Doctor's can't prescribe improving your life]]

In recent years,
[[There has been a decrease in mental health not an increase in mental illness]].
This has resulted in doctor's turning to the one tool that they can reliably enforce, [[drugs]].
It is simply very difficult to convince someone to make the often massive changes to lifestyle needed to properly effect many ailments.
This isn't to say that drugs aren't effective, but drugs have side effects.
