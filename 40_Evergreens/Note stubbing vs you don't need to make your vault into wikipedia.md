#### [[Note stubbing vs you don't need to make your vault into wikipedia]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Many a [[knowledge management|PKM]] guru has warned against "collecting thought vs creating thought" or ["don't make your vault a second wikipedia"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYJsGksojms) and I whole heartedly agree... for beginners. 

There is a difference between idly grabbing every article you read the headline of and creating a process for absorbing articles into you [[second brain]] that involves including the most important text in your vault so you can search for it. There is a difference from bombarding yourself with notes that are summary or copy pasted from wikipedia and using note stubs as a form of connection [[Separate stub notes from the rest of your vault so you don't get overwhelmed]]. 

I believe the difference lies in curating the information in your vault and controlling the way you can access that information. For me this proccess looks this this:
1. Import highlights that are relevant to my learning from what I read so that they are accessible through obisidian search. Include easy to access to the primary source so that context can be easily accessed
2. Add definitions to term and topic notes so that they can be easily accessed with a page preview. 
3. Absorb highlights and notes in the relevant evergreen notes by copying and qouting the text, but removing as much fat as possible.
4. When searches are performed they can be limited to only text within [[evergreen notes|evergreens]], [[topic note|topics]], or [[source note|sources]] or some combination, making accessing information the priority.
