#### [[Prioritize organization over categorization to avoid wasted energy]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Try to create MOC's/[[topic note|topics]] when you are overwhelmed, and stop creating them when you start feeling confined, or start categorizing things just to categorize them. [^1] I started out trying to make tons of tiny topic outlines and then embed them in larger topics until I had my entire vault outlined, but I ended up just getting back to the folder conundrum of spending way to much time deciding where a note should go. [^2] Since then I only create smaller MOC's when the topic is getting too large. It's much easier to move a link around or extract a section out of a big MOC, than it is to remember which specific MOC you put that note in at 2 in the morning a week ago.
