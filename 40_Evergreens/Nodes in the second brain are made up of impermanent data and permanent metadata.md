#### [[Nodes in the second brain are made up of impermanent data and permanent metadata]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

When you create a note in a system like [[Obsidian (software)|Obsidian]], you aren't just creating a file on your computer, or writing out some text, you are creating a universally accessible node that can have as much power as you can get it. The data of this node is impermanent, it can be deleted at the click of a button, but once it has become integrated into the [[second brain]] it's metadata can no longer be easily destroyed: [[The fragility of nodes in a second brain]]

Even if you delete the file, the links will still remain, and the connections can still be made on the graph. This can be used to our advantage, [^1] but it can also be detrimental. [^2] This is why you need to be [[mindfullness|mindfull]] about what you store and how you store it in your second brain: [[Curate source notes and definitions in your second brain to avoid junk text]]

This is not unique to computerized second brains. Have you ever had a word stuck on the tip of your tongue? Remembered everything about an event except what happened? Our brains are mind up of connections through neurons, and even if the destination is gone the connection can remain: [[Nodes in the second brain are an abstraction of our first brain]]
