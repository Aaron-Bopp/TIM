#### [[Nodes in the second brain are made up of impermanent data and permanent metadata]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

When you create a note in a system like [[Obsidian (software)|Obsidian]], you aren't just creating a file on your computer, or writing out some text, you are creating a universally accessible node that can have as much power as you give it. The data of this node is impermanent, it can be deleted at the click of a button, but once it has become integrated into the [[second brain]] it's metadata can no longer be easily destroyed, leading to [[The fragility of nodes in a second brain]]

Even if you delete the file, the links will still remain, and the connections can still be made on the graph. This can be used to our advantage, but it can also be detrimental. [^1] This is why you need to be [[mindfulness|mindful]] about what you store and how you store it in your second brain: [[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge]]

[^1]: [[Separate stub notes from the rest of your vault so you don't get overwhelmed]]

Additionally, when you delete a file, connections that may have existed will disappear, resulting in a loss of data larger than just the data in the file. Whether it be the way that note pulled nodes together on the graph, or that it had a \#TO/DO tag that referenced another note, deleting a note will have effects outside its contents: [[Combine notes instead of deleting them to avoid ghost data in a second brain]] 

This is not unique to computerized second brains. Have you ever had a word stuck on the tip of your tongue? Remembered everything about an event except what happened? Our brains are made up of connections through neurons, and even if the destination is gone the connection can remain: [[Nodes in the second brain are an abstraction of our first brain]]
