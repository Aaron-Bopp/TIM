#### [[Use social order instead of society to better acknowledge hierarchy and inequality]] 

Mentioned in passing in [My Most Valuable Books - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UY9ACqF_RXU) as a part of *Instruction Manual* by [[Perry Lentz]]. This book is as of yet [unfound online](https://www.reddit.com/r/nerdfighters/comments/sta8y0/list_of_books_mentioned_in_my_most_valuable_books/).

Example:
> ![[10_Sources/Readwise/Books/10_Sources/books - The Anthropocene Reviewed#287775024q]]

This seems to be a fairly common practice among books concerning [[anthropology]] and [[Psychology]].

- explained by:: [[Names matter because they effect people's perception and understanding]]
