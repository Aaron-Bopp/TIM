#### [[Use social order instead of society to better acknowledge hierarchy and inequality]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Mentioned in passing in [My Most Valuable Books - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UY9ACqF_RXU) as a part of *Instruction Manual* by [[Perry Lentz]]. This book is as of yet [unfound online](https://www.reddit.com/r/nerdfighters/comments/sta8y0/list_of_books_mentioned_in_my_most_valuable_books/).

Example:
> ![[books_The Anthropocene Reviewed#287775024q]]

These seems to be a fairly common practice among books concerning [[anthropology]], as [[social order]] is often more adapt for early hunter-gatherer [[society]]. 

- [[Names matter because they effect people's perception and understanding]]
