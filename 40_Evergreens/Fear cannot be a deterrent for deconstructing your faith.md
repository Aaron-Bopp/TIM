#### [[Fear cannot be a deterrent for deconstructing your faith]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Deconstructing your faith is like climbing through a jungle canopy]], and often you can't view [[Christianity]] objectively until you reach the top.
Depending on your level of [[indoctrination]] and your continued involvement in the church you may have a more objective view of the [[Christianity]] already,
but I don't think you can get rid of the fear of hell,
or the fear of [[judgement|judgment]],
or the fear of "worldliness"
until you let go of 
the baggage ^[[[Working through trauma can involve of a lot of letting go]]]
and reconcile your fear ^[[[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]]
because: [[Sometimes we can't grow until we change our environment]] 

For those who grew up in the Church or who rely on the church, fear is a very big obstacle to [[Deconstruction (Christianity)|deconstruction]] because [[Fear of hell is baked into Christianity for vulnerable believers]].
This fear can be an [[existential dread]],
^[[[Faith is an abstraction of cognitive dissonance]]] 
or it can be a more material fear of losing people, support, or respect.
^[[[Insecure material conditions increase cognitive load and reduce outcomes]]]
For many people, leaving the church requires leaving most of what they've known,
especially if they have highly religious [[parents]].
^[[[Working through trauma can involve of a lot of letting go]]]

Some people can never truly reach [[objectivity]] with [[Christianity]] because they have had legitimate spiritual experiences or have experienced a personal relationship with god. Those experiences are very much real and are often the main reason people stay in the church: [[The brain is powerful enough to create supernatural experiences]]. 

[[The Christian worldview is incompatible with most other worldviews]] also means that they will [[struggle]] to conceptualize the [[belief systems]] of others in an objective way. 
If you can never get to this place of [[objectivity]], you may get stuck feeling like you're [[Deconstructing your faith can feel like constructing a puzzle that you haven't seen before | constructing a puzzle you haven't seen before]].
