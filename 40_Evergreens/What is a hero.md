#### [[What is a hero]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Its a very good thing to be a hero, especially in literature. The epic poem “Beowulf” totally captures some ways someone can be a hero. Beowulf is so heroic, especially when he fights Grendel and the dragon. These are two really good examples of heroism. Its easy to find examples in this epic poem that totally show how so many good qualities add up to make Beowulf very heroic. Beowulf has something special that makes him be a hero.

The characters in “Beowulf” totally follow a heroic code that includes some characteristics like being really courteous and polite and fighting so courageously. With that being said, Beowulf really stands up for his family members and his subjects. Its what makes him be so heroic. He is so strong, brave, and really full of courage that he becomes a totally great king as well as a great hero.

Another very heroic example from this epic poem is the scene where Beowulf enters a swimming contest with Breca. They both can swim so fast, but Beowulf can totally swim faster because he is so heroic and strong. So, this example really shows what it takes to be a hero according to the really well-defined heroic code that is used throughout the book. Beowulf is totally humble, though, so he really deserves to be king. Kings should totally never brag and should really be letting their actions speak for themselves.
