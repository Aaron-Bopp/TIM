#### [[You can leave the church without loosing your faith]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Many [[Christianity|Christians]] have developed a relationship with what they see as a very empathetic god, but when they are confronted with the horrors that the Church has put people through, they have no choice but to either reconsider their relationship with god or their relationship with the church: [[The biblical Christian God is evil and does not deserve to be worshipped]]

Often it is very hard to stay in the church while you [[Deconstruction (Christianity)|deconstruct]] because while you are trying to change and fix the evil things the church is doing, it is pushing back at you.
^[[[The church will fail if christians keep aligning themselves with hate instead of love]]]
[[Humans love to group eachother]], which means that we have strong affinity for people who are like us.
^[[[Humans are a product of evolution]]]
Even if we know that the group we are a part of has evil members.
[[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]], so we will sometimes side with the wrong people or give people too many chances. 
[[Sometimes we can't grow until we change our environment]], and that may mean leaving the church, so you can get an objective view of [[Christianity]]:
[[Deconstructing your faith is like climbing through a jungle canopy]]

Plenty of people leave the church but still have [[faith]], or are trying to improve church even if they don't have [[faith]]. There's also a really big [[community]] of ex-christians who lead all different kinds of spiritual lives. [[Atheism]] is not the only route for [[Deconstruction (Christianity)]] it's just the route I took.

While [[Christians struggle to feel empathy because they must believe that non-christians are going to hell]] because [[Empathy isn't understanding how you would make the decision it's understanding why they made the decision]], Christians still have a very large capicity for empathy, and if you can get them to direct that it can be very powerful #TO/DO/CONCEPTUALIZE
