#### [[You can leave the church without loosing your faith]] 

Many [[Christianity|Christians]] have developed a relationship with what they see as a very empathetic god, but when they are confronted with the horrors that the Church has put people through, they have no choice but to reconcile their understanding of god with their relationship with the church.
^[Unfortunately, many reconcile this by ignoring and discounting negative accounts of the church or their church for as long as they can. [[The church will fail if christians keep aligning themselves with hate instead of love]]]

Often it is very hard to stay in the church while you [[Deconstruction (Christianity)|deconstruct]] because while you are trying to change and fix the evil things the church is doing, it is pushing back at you.
[[Communities are support systems]],
and unfortunately pushing back against those communities can often involve losing that [[support]].
^[
[[Humans love to group eachother]], which means that we have strong affinity for people who are like us,
because of that we will sometimes side with the wrong people or give people too many chances.
This contributes to [[What are the blindspots of the Christian worldview]]
]
[[Sometimes we can't grow until we change our environment]], and that may mean leaving the church, so you can get an objective view of [[Christianity]].
^[[[Deconstructing your faith is like climbing through a jungle canopy]] describes how difficult this can be]

Plenty of people leave the church but still have [[faith]], or are trying to improve church even if they don't have [[faith]]. There's also a large [[community]] of ex-christians who lead all different kinds of [[spirituality|spiritual]] lives. [[Atheism]] is not the only route for [[Deconstruction (Christianity)]].
