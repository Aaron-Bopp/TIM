#### [[Words should have meaning but we shouldn't value their meaning over people]] 

[[Sex is a social construct]]. Even among circles where [[Gender is a social construct]] is easily accepted this may be controversial. "You can change your [[gender]] but you can't change your sex. You can't change your chromosomes." I am not arguing that you can change XX to XY, but the categorical definition of "sex" does not have to include those. Sure we define sex with chromosomes being part of it, but there are other things well. 
There isn't a problem with defining things. Words should have meaning, but the problem comes when we value those arbitrary categories over people's lives.
