#### [[Webs of thought provide heterarchical structure]] 

part of:: [[Densely linked webs of thought provide intuitive access to knowledge]]

In a [[heterarchy]], items can be related to each other in countless different ways. This could mean be involved in multiple different hierarchies, multiple different taxonomies, or any combination of the two.

At it's core a [[web of thought]] has only one system of organization which is unnamed, unweighted, one way relationships between items.
However this 
allows for:: [[Organization systems are not mutually exclusive]].
A [[web of thought]] is unopinionated.
You can add backlinks, name relationships, place notes in strict hierarchies or use multiple hierarchies, and you can always com back to the core of linking items.
