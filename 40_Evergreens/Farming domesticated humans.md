Wheat did not offer us a better life, but [[Farming outcompeted foraging by allowing for higher populations]]. Cultivating wheat allowed for the population to grow exponentially.
[[Farming prevented a return to foraging for early humans]]

This domestication lead to the development of [[society]] and [[Culture]] as human's being closer together for long periods of time allowed them to develop an [[Imagined reality]], which 
leads to:: [[Social order is built off of a shared belief in an imagined reality]] and [[Greater cooperation and communication has lead to the success of humans as a species]].
