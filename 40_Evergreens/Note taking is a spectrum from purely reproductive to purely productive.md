#### [[Note taking is a spectrum from purely reproductive to purely productive]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Three possible kinds of notes
- [[Conceptual notes]] notes that are purely taken on individual concepts
	- [[evergreen notes]] and [[topic notes]]
- [[referential notes]] notes that are taken in the sequence of the thing they are notating like a lecture or book
	- [[source notes]]
- Transformative notes: notes that transform the material into things like questions and answers or prompts
	- [[evergreen notes]]

Notes we take in school are mainly reproductive notes. 

Where is the line being producing a note and [[creativity]]? Is there any difference #TO/PONDER/IDEA 
[[There is a difference between thinking and creating]]

##### What are the starter types of note taking?

> Flash cards (index cards you flip over like the kid game memory) / cornell notes (it's named for the school, no special meaning) / and "the index card method" which is simultaneously the same thing as flash cards and also the literal opposite
