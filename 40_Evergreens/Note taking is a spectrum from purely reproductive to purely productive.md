#### [[Note taking is a spectrum from purely reproductive to purely productive]] 

possible kinds of notes
- [[referential notes]] notes that are taken in the sequence of the thing they are notating like a lecture or book
	- [[source notes]], class notes
- [[Conceptual notes]] notes that are purely taken on individual concepts
	- [[topic notes]], wikipedia articles
- [[organizational notes]] - mainly exists in [[web of thought|webs of thought]] as other mediums have organization through tables of content
	- [[topic notes]], structure zettel, MOC

Notes we take in school are mainly referential notes. 

[[There is a difference between thinking and creating]], and during note taking that line start adding your own insights to notes.

##### What are the starter types of note taking?

> Flash cards (index cards you flip over like the kid game memory) / cornell notes (it's named for the school, no special meaning) / and "the index card method" which is simultaneously the same thing as flash cards and also the literal opposite
