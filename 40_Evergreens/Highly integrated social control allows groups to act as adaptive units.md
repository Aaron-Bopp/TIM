#### [[Highly integrated social control allows groups to act as adaptive units]] 

This is an argument made in [[Darwin's Cathedral by David Sloan Wilson]] and requires an understanding of how [[group selection]] allows for traits to be selected for based on competition between groups rather than individuals.
Wilson uses this to make strong arguments for [[Religion as a group level adaptation]] and [[Cultural Evolution]],
but he grounds this thought in organisms that are capable of much higher levels of [[social control]] than humans.

One example given is that of chromosomes. 
The genes that are stored on the chromosomes are physically inseparable from each other forcing them to replicate as a unit. This allows the process of [[natural selection]] to take place at a higher level (no longer among genes but among cells).

Another is of how [[eukaryotic]] cells are actually connected networks of [[bacteria]] working together in ways unlike other bacteria.

Viewing selection in this ways allows [[group selection]] to be a dominating force in thousands of species, which 
leads to:: [[Individual selection is an emergent mechanic of group selection]]

In [[human behavior]], this is seen as [[Social control promotes highly altruistic behavior within groups]] in [[Religion promotes high social control]].
