#### [[Parents need to model the ability to deal with emotion to their children]] 

During [[childhood]], it is incredibly important that the [[parents]] model [[self-soothing]], [[self care]], [[self-love|self-validation]], but if [[parents]] fail to teach these things sometimes the opposite can be taught

Lack of this can lead to [[confidence]] problems because [[confidence]] comes from empathic mirroring [^1] See [[Attachment Theory]]

Coming from an unloving home makes it hard to take in kindness or understand that you're lovable because that brings up the grief of not being loved in childhood. [^2]
