#### [[Parents need to model the ability to deal with emotion to their children]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

During [[childhood]], it is incredibly important that the [[parents]] model [[self-soothing]], [[self care]], [[self-love|self-validation]], but if [[parents]] fail to teach these things sometimes the opposite can be taught

> A lot of times it stems from abuse, really critical [[parents]], and/or a god-based religion where your deeds are [[judgement|judged]] and determined whether you are punished if you're not good enough (think eternal damnation, things going wrong or bad things happening as punishment)

> relating this to Eriksons theory of Psychodevelopment: stage 3 initiative v shame and guilt. In this stage kids want to start to do things on their own like tie their shoes, pick out their own outfits etc. and if allowed to the Child will develop a sense of autonomy and be way

Lack of this can lead to [[confidence]] problems because [[confidence]] comes from empathic mirroring [^1] See [[Attachment Theory]]

Coming from an unloving home makes it hard to take in kindness or understand that you're lovable because that brings up the grief of not being loved in childhood. [^2]
