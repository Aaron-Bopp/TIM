#### [[The biblical christian God is evil and does not deserved to be worshipped]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

It is hard to look at the god described in the bible and not think he is either maliciously evil, or blatantly selfish. Which makes [[The biblical christian God is evil and does not deserved to be worshipped]] unsurprising.

- [[You can leave the church and still believe in the christian god]]
- [[Fear of hell is baked into Christianity]]


> I can't believe that the [[The bible is god breathed|Bible is infallible]] because I **cannot understand how a loving being could commit genocide so freely and unashamedly**. I cannot reconcile a god who would intentionally create a being with the knowledge that they would sin (and create the tree to let them do it) and still condemn them to hell as if it were only on them.
