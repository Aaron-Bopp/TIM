#### [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Evergreen notes]] can be as small as a few sentences or as expansive as an entire breakdown of an idea.
Previous writing is just fertalizer for evergreen notes,
and writing evergreen notes is just practice for future thought. 

[[Fear is the number one hindrance to trying]], but evergreen notes should not inspire fear,
they should inspire [[creativity]]:
[[Your second brain should be an inspirational hub of creativity]]
