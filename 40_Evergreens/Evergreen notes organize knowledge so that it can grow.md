#### [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]] 

[[Evergreen notes]] can be as small as a few sentences or as expansive as an entire breakdown of an idea.
If you have a concept, write it down and see what you can link to it.
Often times an imperative, descriptive title and backlinks are all a note needs to have longevity, other time you may need a sentence or two of context so that you don't forget what you were thinking.
[[Fear is the number one hindrance to trying]], but evergreen notes should not inspire fear,
they should inspire [[creativity]]:
[[Your second brain should be an inspirational hub of creativity]]

With [[evergreen notes]],
you don't need to have a fully formulated idea to start writing, so 
[[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]].
As you continue to spend time with your notes you will develop them, not just based on the idea's you had at the time, but on new ideas. As you reread over old notes you will find connections to new notes or old notes that you have new understanding of. In this way evergreen notes help you grow your [[knowledge]] over time.

From [[Andy Matuschak's Evergreen Notes]]: [Evergreen note-writing helps insight accumulate](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6cFzJWgj9vZpnrQsjrZ8yCNREzCTgyFeVZTb) however my concept of [[evergreen notes]] is just slightly different than his: [[What are the differences between evergreen notes and conceptual notes]]

##### Counter:: Evergreen notes don't allow for new ideas

As I have described this system to people, they sometimes ask, "What if the notes that you keep coming back to are wrong?" I have also heard people refer to reviewing their own notes as, "Succumbing to their personal [[propaganda]]." I understand these concerns, because there is a large amount of self reference in [[evergreen notes]]. If you are not being cognizant, a logical fallacy could weave it's way into your notes, effectively poisoning your [[second brain]]. This isn't something I have experienced, but then again, most people aren't aware of the logical fallacies they believe.
^[[[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]]]
However, I think that as long as you are ingesting new idea's from outside sources, and going back and reviewing old notes in light of that new [[information]] you are actually going to less likely to fall into this trap than most people. 

If you hold a [[stereotype]], but don't actually interact with that [[stereotype]] very often, you aren't going to think about it. You may have learned new perspectives that contradict that stereotype, but because you never think about it, you have not deconstructed that old idea. When that stereotype does come up, your old ideas will come to the surface, and you may not realize how they contradict your new perspectives. This could lead to [[cognitive dissonance]], and hopefully would lead to you reconsidering that [[stereotype]], but that doesn't always happen: [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]]

However, if you had put this stereotype into you [[evergreen notes]] (most likely indirectly),
you would have reviewed it as you learned new perspectives, 
and would have given it up much sooner. 
In this way I think evergreen notes would be better for allowing new ideas:
[[Evergreen notes should be constantly integrating new knowledge]]
