[[Evergreen notes]] can be as small as a few sentences or as expansive as an entire breakdown of an idea.
Previous writing is just fertilizer for evergreen notes,
and writing evergreen notes is just practice for future thought. 

[[Fear is the number one hindrance to trying]], but evergreen notes should not inspire fear,
they should inspire [[creativity]]:
[[Your second brain should be an inspirational hub of creativity]]

[[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]], you don't need to have a fully formulated idea to start writing. As you continue to spend time with your notes you will develop them not just based on the idea's you had at the time, but new ideas. As you reread over old notes you will find connections to new notes or old notes that you have gained new understanding of. In this way evergreen notes helps you grow your knowledge over time.

##### Counter:: Evergreen notes don't allow for new ideas

As I have described this system to people, they sometimes ask, "What if the notes that you keep coming back to are wrong?" I have also heard people refer to reviewing their own notes as, "Succumbing to their personal [[propaganda]]." I understand these concerns, because there is a large amount of self reference in [[evergreen notes]]. If you are not being cognizant, a logical fallacy could weave it's way into your notes, effectively poisoning your [[second brain]]. This isn't something I have experienced, but then again, most people aren't aware of the logical fallacies they believe.
^[[[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]]]
I think though that as long as you are ingesting new idea's from outside sources, and going back and reviewing old notes in light of that new information you are actually going to less likely to fall into this trap than most people. 

If you hold a [[Stereotype]], but don't actually interact with that [[Stereotype]] very often, you aren't going to think about it. You may have learned new perspectives that contradict that stereotype, but because you never think about it, you have not deconstructed that old idea. When that stereotype does come up, your old ideas will come to the surface, and you may not realize how the contradict your new perspectives. This could lead to [[cognitive dissonance]], and hopefully would lead to you reconsidering that [[Stereotype]], but that doesn't always happen: [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]]

However, if you had put this stereotype into you [[evergreen notes]], (most likely indirectly) you would have reviewed it as you learned new perspectives, and would have given it up much sooner. In this way I think evergreen notes would be better for allowing new ideas: [[Evergreen notes should be constantly integrating new knowledge]]
