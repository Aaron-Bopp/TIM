#### [[What is the meaning of life]]

answered by:: [[Life is what you make of it]]

We can ponder this question until the end of time.
In a way any answer we come to is no more true than what it can accomplish for us.
If we believe the meaning of life is helping people we will go help people.
If we believe there is no meaning to life we will do nothing.
