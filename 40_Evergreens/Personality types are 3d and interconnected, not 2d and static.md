#### [[Personality types are 3d and interconnected, not 2d and static]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Your personality type will change over your life, it may even change on what kind of mood you're in. This is part the fault of how personality tests like [[Meyers Briggs]] work and part the fault of people's inaccurate views of themselves, but it can be avoided.

[[Enneagram]] does a good job at create personality types that are specific enough to be helpful, but get at the root of peoples personalities. Often times revealing the [[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood|the wide assumptions we make in early childhood]]. 

In [[Ayurveda]] there is the concept of [[Dosha]] which is a genetically determined [[personality]] type is both physical and mental. Both [[Enneagram]] and [[Dosha]] have a concept of what happens to the [[personality]] when stressed, although [[Ayurveda]] pushes the [[mind-body complex]] much more and actually links certain [[disease]]s to your [[Dosha]]
