#### [[The actual path to being a good person isn't explored by Evangelicalism]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

%% This is ironic as any Evangelical will tell you they believe man is inherently evil%%

While the bible does talk about how to be a good person,
^[the ethics and success of it's teachings are up for debate]
but they have largely abandoned this doctrine 
because [[Evangelicalism has commodified faith for profit]].

[[Faith is an abstraction of cognitive dissonance]], which means that it is using [[faith]] to help deal with the fact that [[Knowledge of the world is painful]],
^[[[What is the cognitive effect of living in an unjust world]]]
instead of focusing on improving the the lives of [[Christianity|Christians]]. 

[[Evangelicalism]] hides the work and the struggle so that it can convert and control more people:
[[Worldviews should not make life seem easy and simple]]

%%
#TO/TEND/MULCH 
[[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]], and because [[Christianity]] is taught so early in childhood [^1] this is even more impactful: [[Religious concepts are often too powerful for a child's mind]]

[^1]: [[Children make wide assumptions about the world]]

[[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things]], and if we believe are saved we cannot comprehend choosing damnation: [[Christians struggle to feel empathy because they must believe that non-christians are going to hell]]
