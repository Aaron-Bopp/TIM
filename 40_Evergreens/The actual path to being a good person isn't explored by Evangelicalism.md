#### [[The actual path to being a good person isn't explored by Evangelicalism]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

%% This is ironic as any Evangelical will tell you they believe man is inherently evil %%
%% #TO/DO/FIND examples of evangelicalism failing in this way. %%

[[Evangelicalism]] hides the work and the struggle so that it can convert and control more people.
While the bible does talk about how to be a good person,
(the ethics and success of it's teachings are up for debate)
they have largely abandoned this doctrine 
because:: [[Evangelicalism has commodified faith for profit]].

This is a large 
part of:: [[The church will fail if christians keep aligning themselves with hate instead of love]].
The Evangelical church didn't teach people how to be good so it is failing (and it is spreading this rot to the rest of [[Christianity]]).
[[Worldviews should not make life seem easy and simple]], and we are seeing the results of [[worldview]] doing just that.

- leads to:: [[What are the blindspots of the Christian worldview]]
- explained by::  [[Faith is an abstraction of cognitive dissonance]]
