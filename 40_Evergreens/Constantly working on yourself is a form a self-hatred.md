#### [[Constantly working on yourself is a form a self-hatred]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

You can't hate yourself for every mistake you make. You have to accept that you made them and sometimes that's okay. [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]], you will never be perfect, perfect doesn't exist, just be you.

[[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]], and self-hatred is a very egocentric process. If you can not even entertain the thought that you are pushing yourself too hard, you may be [[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions| making rationalizations against strong emotions]].

[[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]], why would that be limited to things that are destructive. If you can never stop working, never stop pushing yourself, even when everyone around is trying to get you to take a break, you may be running from something.

If you can never be content that you are good enough, you are just looking for another part of your [[self]] to hate and are falling into the trap that [[Sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion]]. Loving yourself costs nothing.
