#### [[Constantly working on yourself is a form a self-hatred]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

You can't hate yourself for every mistake you make. You have to accept that you made them and sometimes that's okay.

If you can never be content that you are good enough, you are just looking for another part of your [[self]] to hate and are falling into the trap that [[Sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion]]. Loving yourself costs nothing.
