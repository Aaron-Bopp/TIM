#### [[What are the blindspots of the Christian worldview]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Because:: [[Faith is an abstraction of cognitive dissonance]], [[Belief reinforces your worldview]], and [[People have been conditioned to believe the bible has to be infallible]],
Christians are in a very interesting spot today.
They are faced with a world that is growing farther and farther away from their ideals and they are struggling to deal with that fact.

Many Christians have made concessions, either partially giving up on the infallibility of the bible, or admitting that they don't know why it says what it says. 
Unfortunately, this isn't sustainable.
For example, some Christians have started to support gay marriage, 
but this is only after years of [[activism]] and a massive cultural shift have forced them to.
While they aren't likely to go back on their support for gay marriage, they will have to go through the years long journey to acceptance for the next cultural change.

The question is if there is a version of the Christian worldview that does not have this problem, and if their isn't what is the next blindspot that Christian's will have to deal with.

- includes:: [[Christians struggle to feel empathy because they must believe that non-christians are going to hell]]
- from:: [[My worldview is not about conversion it is about acceptance]]
