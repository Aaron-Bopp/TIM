#### [[Separate stub notes from the rest of your vault so you don't get overwhelmed]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Creating [[stub notes]] can be a really powerful thing in a [[web of thought]] and are important for it to function as a [[second brain]]. 

Oftentimes creating a stub will illuminate just how much you mention a term, or will start to pull together notes on a graph, or maybe it will just allow you to use autocomplete. However it can be very easy to get overwhelmed feeling like every note in your [[knowledge management|PKM]] system must have content and be valuable but that is not the purpose of these stubs. You system should have processes in place so that stubs do not get in your way, and you can just fill them out as you feel you need to. This is how you reduce [[The fragility of nodes in a second brain]]

- [[Stub notes are data structures for implicit knowledge gathering]]
- [[Curate source notes and definitions in your second brain to avoid junk text]]
