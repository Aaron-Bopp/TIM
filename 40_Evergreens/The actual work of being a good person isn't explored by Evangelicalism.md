#### [[The actual work of being a good person isn't explored by Evangelicalism]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Faith is an abstraction of cognitive dissonance]], this means that it is using [[faith]] to help deal with the [[injustice]] of the world.
^[[[What is the cognitive effect of living in an unjust world]]]
While the bible does talk about how to be a good person,
^[the ethics and success of it's teachings are up for debate]
[[Evangelicalism has commodified faith for profit]] and so they have largely abandoned this doctrine.


"Have [[faith]] and you will be saved. Believe in the lord god and he will make your pain go away." These are empty promises. [[Evangelicalism]] hides the work and the struggle so that it can convert and control more people: [[Worldviews are wrong if they make life seem easy and simple]]

[[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]], and because [[Christianity]] is taught so early in childhood [^1] this is even more impactful: [[Religious concepts are often too powerful for a child's mind]]

[^1]: [[Children make wide assumptions about the world]]

[[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things]], and if we believe are saved we cannot comprehend choosing damnation: [[Christians struggle to feel empathy because they must believe that non-christians are going to hell]]
