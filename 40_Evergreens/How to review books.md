#### [[How to review books]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

First:: [[The five star scale is for consumer and the ten point scale is for the critic]]

As a consumer, when I rate books I want to hold my rating to whether or not somebody else should read that book. 
For me a book doesn't have to be "flawless" to be a rated five stars, it just has to be meaningful enough for anybody to read it.

| Rating | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 5-star | Everybody who can ^[can here means that even if the vocabulary or length is too much for someone, the book can still be rated five-stars, i.e. not everybody is able to spends months reading *War and Peace*] should read this book |
| 4-star | If you are interested in this book you should read it                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 3-star | This book should be read by people who have read similar books or books in the same genre and think they will enjoy it/find it useful                                                                                         |
| 2-star | This book has many flaws and shouldn't be read by someone unfamiliar with the content area or genre, but there is still some value in the contents |
| 1-star | This book is harmful, uninteresting, or bad enough that nobody should read it                                                                                                                                                        |

##### Who has the right to critique books
This largely depends on the medium. The scale above can largely be applied to both non-fiction and fiction, but when critiquing books, the book should be able to be compared to other books within it's genre. I think the reviewer should be well read in a genre before they start critiquing books in the genre, and for non-fiction they should be critiquing books in light of current information. 
^[Yes this means that a book's rating may fall over time, but this only adds more weight the rating, a true 10/10 should be timeless]

I haven't reached a point in any genre to start being a critic, ^[except the genre of reviewing reviewers] but I think that a good critique would likely involve at least some of the following categories.

| Category              | Meaning                                                              |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Informational content | Is the [[information]] accurate and useful                               |
| Educational content   | Is the [[information]] conveyed in a understandable way                  |
| Emotional content     | Does the book elicit the proper emotional responses to the content   |
| Quality of [[writing]]    | Is the writing understandable and fits the genre                     |
| Literary merit        | Does the book as a offer something unique and valuable to it's genre |
