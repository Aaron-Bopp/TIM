#### [[What is the origin of social hierarchy]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

part of:: [[What is the cognitive origin of our social order]]
explains:: [[What maintains our social order]]

Answering this 
includes:: [[What is the cognitive origin of social hierarchy]]

Answers:
- [[Once hierarchy is in place vested interests will keep it in place]]
- [[We naturally define relationships between ideas]]
- [[Hammurabi's Code preserved hierarchy through deific justice]]
- [[Theology preserves hierarchy through deific blessing]]

Those at the top of the hierarchy will try to make everybody believe that it is the natural order,
but they know that the order is only real as long as we collectively believe it is real:
[[Social order is built off of a shared belief in an imagined reality]]
