#### [[What is the origin of social hierarchy]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

- part of:: [[What enables widespread social order]]
- explains:: [[What maintains our social order]]

Answering this 
includes:: [[What is the cognitive origin of social hierarchy]].
There is something in human brains that understands [[hierarchy]] and sees it as right or wrong.

Answers:
- It was just coincidence [[Once hierarchy is in place vested interests will keep it in place]]
- it's a symbolic of our [[social behavior]] [[We naturally define relationships between ideas]]
- it's pushed by powerful individuals [[Hammurabi's Code preserved hierarchy through deific justice]]

Those at the top of the hierarchy will try to make everybody believe that it is the natural order,
but they know that the order is only real as long as we collectively believe it is real:
[[Social order is built off of a shared belief in an imagined reality]]
