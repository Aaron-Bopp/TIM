#### [[Self-reppression is the most natural response for trans people in strongly gendered environments]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

#TO/TEND/REFACTOR [[Trans children will repress their dysphoria if they have been effectively taught it is unnaceptable]], [[You can be taught to invalidate your own emotions]], [[Avoidance IS the most-efficient way of dealing with emotion]]

Trans people can look at [[Observational learning]] and [[gender schema]]'s and find explanations for why they may have never questioned their gender until late in life. Studies like the Pike and Jennings commercial study in 2005 [^1] show that children as young as 5 and 6 have a gender schema, and it impacts how they learn about the world ([[Children will imitate whatever is modeled for them]]). This means that trans people could observe, imitate, and limit themselves to gendered behavior for their assigned [[gender]] without ever performing behaviors for their actual gender, and even if they did, punishment (especially from strongly gendered authority figures ie [[parents]], [[childhood]] [[trauma]]) for that behavior would reinforce their gender schema. 

This is why thoughts like [[You're never sure if you're trans]] is so difficult to overcome.
