#### [[Many Christians confuse not sinning for morality]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Just because you have no reason to sin and do not, does not mean you are any more moral than a person who has every reason to sin and does.

When you see something like a chained park table, is your first thought, "There are people in this neighborhood who would steal park tables" or "There are people in the neighborhood who need a table"

- [[The Christian worldview is incompatible with most other worldviews]]
- [[The church will fail if christians keep aligning themselves with hate instead of love]]
