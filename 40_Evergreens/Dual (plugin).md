#### [[Dual (plugin)]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

**Source Code**:: https://github.com/Psionica/Dual

**Docs**:: https://psionica.org/docs/workshop/dual/

Dual is a digital assistant powered by [[GPT]] that interacts with your [[Obsidian (software)]] notes and uses its trained language model ([[NLP]]) to preform various tasks. It can be prompted with natural language commands and trained with various skills to perform more defined functions. It can also use code snippets to perform various more complicated functions.

[[Dual (plugin)]] can be a major part in how your notes become a legitimate [[second brain]].

Dual has been implemented as a plugin for [[Obsidian (software)]], and can be trained with the user's note archive. 

Startup Dual Server (after installation):: `python3 server.py --path "c:\Users\s533127\Desktop\Obsidian-notes"` in the Dual plugin folder
