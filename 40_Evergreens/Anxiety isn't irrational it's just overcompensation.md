#### [[Anxiety isn't irrational it's just overcompensation]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

%%
#TO/TEND/MULCH 
People who say [[anxiety]] is irrational are just unaware of their surroundings,
or they will answer to their fears but not understand where they come from: [[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]]
%%

For the most part [[anxiety]] is a completely natural and normal [[Neuroscience|neurological]] reaction.
[[Anxiety]] can either be a result of [[Our brains are built around survival]],
which is [[Physiologic Anxiety]], 
or it can be a result of [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]],
which is [[Cognitive Anxiety]].
These anxieties swerve into overcompensation usually when it involves social situations, or by 
[[trauma]] (i.e. [[Rejection Sensitivity]]), 
[[neurodiversity]],
or simply a warped sense of reality. 
^[Anxiety can be the [[manifestation]] of the [[cognitive dissonance]] that warps your [[perception]]: [[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things]]]

We can attack anxiety by gaining [[detachment]], because [[Attachment fuels anxiety]], 
or we can do so by gaining [[confidence]]:
[[Confidence comes when you are more capable of handling diverse outcomes]]

Either way [[Anxiety should be a tool at your disposal not an impedance to your life]]
