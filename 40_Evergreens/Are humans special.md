#### [[Are humans special]]

For most of [[history]], the answer to this questions was invariably yes.
From [[Judaism]] to [[natural-law religions]],
belief that human's are special, placed in special place in the universe, was impossible to imagine otherwise.
This belief resulted in the murder of Galileo.
