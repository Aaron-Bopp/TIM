#### [[We can control our body through our breath]] 

Our breath is the pathway to controlling the biological mechanisms that govern our body. We can use this to affect and control our mood and reduce [[anxiety]],
^[[[notes_Breath and Mind]]]
or we can even use it to override our natural instincts and push our body farther than it could go alone.

[[Pranayama]], [[Qi Gong]], and the [[Wim Hof Method]] are methods that are focused on this, but all methods of [[meditation]]
interact with it in some way.
Through this we can take control of our systems of [[homeostasis]]:
[[Meditation helps us regulate our nervous system]]

This is a big 
part of:: [[Meditation improves mental, physical, and emotional health]]
