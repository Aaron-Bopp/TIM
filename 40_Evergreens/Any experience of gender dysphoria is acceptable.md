#### [[Any experience of gender dysphoria is acceptable]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Gender Dysphoria]] does not have to be a strong sense of being completely in the wrong body and completely the wrong [[gender]] with all the wrong body parts. Similar to [[Any experience of gender is acceptable]], any experience of [[gender dysphoria]] is acceptable and you don't need to feel dysphoria to be [[transgender|trans]]. People will experience [[gender]] differently and any inconsistency with other [[transgender|trans]] people does not invalidate their transness.

[[Gender is both an intrinsic experience and a necessary expression]], so [[gender dysphoria]] can affect many different aspects of your life.
Dysphoria can be any sense unease or generalized dissatisfaction with life but in [[transgender|trans]] people can develop into [[self-hate]], because [[Self-hatred is born out of dissonance between self-image and self-perception]].
 
Various experiences of [[gender dysphoria]]:
- [[Gender Dysphoria is based in a intrinsic wrongness of self]]

Gender dysphoria can also lead to us developing insecurities that have major affects on our [[identity]].
- [[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]]
- [[A repressed self creates a mistrust of self-love and self-esteem]]
