#### [[Social anxiety is a feedback loop]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Your anxiety is telling you everything that could go wrong, not what will go wrong]],
but our [[brain]] believes these thoughts as if they are reality. 
[[Social anxiety isn't irrational it's just overcompensation]], and you are frustrated that your [[anxiety]] is impeding you from something as simple as talking to people.

So you try to be more [[socialization|social]] and this happens:
1. [[A secure identity is the best defense against social anxiety]] but you don't have a secure identity because your not able to be your true [[self]] because...
2. [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]]. There is a some [[insecurity]] that you could fix if but you can treat this because... 
3. [[Identity is your understanding of yourself vs your interaction with the world]] so your [[identity]] is that of someone who is unable to do what they want to do and so the [[feedback loop]] repeats

[[Social anxiety]] disorders can lead to introverted, highly socially aware individuals, and addressing that [[anxiety]] can sometimes be seen as the destruction of an essential part of their [[identity]].
^[[[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]] and [[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]]]
The only way out of this is loop is [[self-actualization]], and spending too much time in this loop can lead to [[Sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion|The fallacy that sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion]] or repressing your [[identity]] even further: [[A repressed identity creates a mistrust of self-love and self-esteem]]

If we fail to get out of this [[feedback loop]] it will distort our [[self-image]] which will only give our [[brain]] more insecurities to throw back at us: [[Self-hatred is born out of dissonance between self-image and self-perception]]
