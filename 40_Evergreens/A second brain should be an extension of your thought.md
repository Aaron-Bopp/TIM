#### [[A second brain should be an extension of your thought]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

If you are unsure what to even put in a [[second brain]], 
[[When in doubt, write what you think]] and [[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]]

- [[Nodes in the second brain are an abstraction of our first brain]]
- [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]]
- [[Densely linked webs of thought provide intuitive access to knowledge]] 

##### Counter:: your notes will never be a "second brain"

This is a opinion shared by [[newsletter.eleanorkonik.com|Eleanor Konik]] in this article [Obsidian is my Thinking Environment not my Second Brain](https://www.obsidianroundup.org/ite-not-second-brain/)

I latched onto the term [[second brain]] not as any concrete system, but as a lofty goal for how to configure my vault. My brain worked great, but every note system I had tried up to that point had actively worked against it. A second brain would reflect it, not recreate it
