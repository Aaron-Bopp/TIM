#### [[A second brain should be an extension of your thought]] 

> ![[articles_IA for PKM — Crows, Camels, Concepts, and the Cognitive Divide#^292190330]]

There are three types of [[knowledge]]:
- What other people know
- What you know other people know
- What you know

The only way we can learn is by transforming [[information]] from being what other people know, to what we know,
making this
part of:: [[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge]].

We can see this in how we organize our [[second brain]]:
- [[Nodes in the second brain are an abstraction of our first brain]] mirrors how we think
- [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]] mirrors how we learn
- [[Densely linked webs of thought provide intuitive access to knowledge]] mirrors how we remember

##### Counter:: your notes will never be a "second brain"

This is a opinion shared by [[newsletter.eleanorkonik.com|Eleanor Konik]] in this article [Obsidian is my Thinking Environment not my Second Brain](https://www.obsidianroundup.org/ite-not-second-brain/)

I latched onto the term [[second brain]] not as any concrete system, but as a lofty goal for how to configure my vault. My brain worked great, but every note system I had tried up to that point had actively worked against it. A second brain would reflect it, not recreate it
