#### [[Growing up is being able to articulate the hope more than the hopelessness]] 

%% #TO/TEND/WEED  %%
When you are very young, you have 
nothing but hope,
but as you grow older you are overwhelmed by 
[[Knowledge of an unjust world is painful|the knowledge of an unjust world]].
This can easily lead into the belief that[[Sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion]].
When you are young, you don't know when to expect change to come. You feel like it has been long. 
When you are older you realize that 
you may not be able to control when
change will come, but
you just have to be ready to take advantage of it when it does.
When you have no hope, 
you don't have a reason to work towards change
and so you will miss your chances.
Change does not come from one action, it comes from persistent action.
This is 
why:: [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]]

This is
- explained by:: [[Hope is not optimism it is a practice for producing change]]
- part of:: [[Be the change you want to see in the world]]

#TO/PONDER/ME 
Age gives you perspective. Changing systemic problems takes generations. You have to have [[hope]] for future generations.
But how does this interact with [[Knowledge of an unjust world is painful]]?
