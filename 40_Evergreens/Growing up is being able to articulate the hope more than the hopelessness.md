Age gives you perspective. Changing systemic problems takes generations. You have to have [[hope]] for future generations.

- [[Hope is not optimism it is a practice for producing change]]
- [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]]
- [[You can't blame people for failing to rise above their circumstances]]

- [[How to pursue the positive things in life]]

- [[The most reliable path to success is repeatedly trying to succeed]]
