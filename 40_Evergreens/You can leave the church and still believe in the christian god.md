#### [[You can leave the church and still believe in the christian god]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Plenty of people leave the church but still have [[faith]], or are trying to improve church even if they don't have [[faith]]. There's also a really big [[community]] of ex-christians who lead all different kinds of spiritual lives. Athiesm is not the only route for [[Deconstruction (Christianity)]] its just the route I took.

While [[Christians struggle to feel empathy because they must believe that non-christians are going to hell]], many [[Christianity|Christians]] have developed a relationship with what they see as a very empathetic god, but when they are confronted with the horrors that the Church has put people through they have no choice but to either reconsider their relationship with god or their relationship with the church: [[The biblical christian God is evil and does not deserve to be worshipped]]

Often it is very hard to stay in the church because while you are trying to change and fix the evil things the church is doing, it is pushing back at you. [[Humans are a product of evolution]], and this means that we have strong affinity for people who are like us, [^1] even if we know that the group we are a part of has evil members. [[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]], so we will sometimes side with the wrong people. #TO/DO/CONCEPTUALIZE thoughts from the other night

[^1]: [[Humans love to group eachother]]
