#### [[Yoga is a wholistic philosophy of self-improvement]] 

[[Yoga]] involves the [[mind]], [[body]], and [[soul]] in the process of [[self-improvement]] and [[self-actualization]]. 
It does this by helping us understand and connect the different parts of our being.

[[Yoga]] is a tradition that combines the mental, physical, and metaphysical parts of the [[human experience]] through [[meditation]], [[asanas]], and [[Brahman]].
In [[Yoga|Yogic]] tradition [[Consciousness is the fundamental unit of existence]], and when we meditate we are tapping into the manifestation of the energy of the [[universe]].
Because [[Consciousness is our capacity to introspect]],
[[meditation]] is not only [[Meditation is a practice to gain control over your thoughts|a practice to gain control over your thoughts]] it [[Meditation increases our ability to influence the world|increases our ability to influence the world]].
[[The history of meditation is a mixture of science and spirituality]] because it is the product of the [[Yogi|Yogis]] intense study of the human [[mind]] and [[body]].

This is not to say that [[Yoga]] promises to make us all sorcerers.
^[In fact, we have already done that: [[Business people are sorcerers]]]
[[Karma is an open ended system of belief]], and [[Yoga]] is little more than a way to increase our [[karma]].
[[Yogi|Yogis]] acknowledge that [[You can't control what happens]],
but their practice is culmination of [[Right kinds of thoughts lead to right kinds of actions]]. 

[[Raja Yoga]] focuses on helping you make those right thoughts and actions into a reality with practices that will improve your life and view of the world.
^[[[notes - History of Meditation]]]
- Actions for improving your interaction with the world
	1. [[Yama]] pure standards; how we observe the world
	2. [[Niyama]] good morals; how we make our way through the world
- Practices for improving your [[mind-body complex]]  
	1. [[asanas]] [[Yoga]] postures
	4. [[Pranayama]] breath practices
	5. [[Pratyahara]] restrain impulses
- Goals for improving your [[consciousness]]  
	1. [[Dharana]] focusing
	7. [[Dhyana]] state of [[meditation]]
	8. [[Samadhi]] state of temporary [[enlightenment]]

If you are intimidated by this, 
remember:: [[Worldviews should not make life seem easy and simple]].

- part of:: [[Meditation improves mental, physical, and emotional health]]
- similarly::	[[Buddhism outlines a path and practice to end suffering, but does not promise it]]
