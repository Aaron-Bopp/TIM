#### [[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]], and our ego is the amalgamation of those defense-mechanism ready to activate at anytime. If the trigger is strong enough, we can completely dissolve into our ego, lose connection to our true [[self]], and fallback to whatever defense-mechanisms we have developed without a chance to intercept and change them.
