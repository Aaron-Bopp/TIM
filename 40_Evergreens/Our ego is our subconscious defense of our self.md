#### [[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

> "Ego is when your sense of self comes from the outside" - [[Dr. K]]
> [Healing from Festered Emotions ft. CrankGameplays (co-creator of Unus Annus) - YouTube](https://youtu.be/sXGhT4pJcj8?t=5255)

[[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]], and our [[ego]] is the amalgamation of those [[defense-mechanisms]], ready to activate at anytime. If the trigger is strong enough, we can completely dissolve into our ego, lose connection to our true [[self]], and fallback to whatever [[coping-mechanisms]] we have developed without a chance to intercept and change them.

This is because [[The brain lodges emotional reactions in our unconscious memory]]. These [[emotions]] can then effect our rational [[mind]] and cause us to find [[rationalizations]] that protect our self. 
These [[rationalizations]] are fueled by your [[emotions]], which are then pushed down by your [[rationalizations]]. 
This creates the [[ego]], which is the sense of "I" that we compare our experiences to.
^[You can see how this can lead to [[Self-hatred is born out of dissonance between self-image and self-perception]] as our [[ego]] pushes our [[self-perception]] more and more out of line with our [[self-image]]]


 %%[[How I process repressed emotions]]%%

[[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]], is the [[ego]] just a amalgamation of our [[cognitive dissonance]]? and [[Is cognitive dissonance the reason for harmful behaviors]]?
