> "Ego is when your sense of self comes from the outside" - [[Dr. K]]

 %%[[How I process repressed emotions]]%%

[[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]], is the [[ego]] just a amalgamation of our [[cognitive dissonance]]? and [[Is cognitive dissonance the reason for harmful behaviors]]?
