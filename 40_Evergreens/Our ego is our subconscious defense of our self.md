#### [[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]], and our [[subconscious|ego]] is the amalgamation of those defense-mechanisms, ready to activate at anytime. If the trigger is strong enough, we can completely dissolve into our ego, lose connection to our true [[self]], and fallback to whatever [[defense-mechanisms]] we have developed without a chance to intercept and change them: [[How to process repressed emotions]]
 %%[[How I process repressed emotions]]%%

[[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]], is the [[subconscious|ego]] just a amalgamation of our [[cognitive dissonance]]? and [[Is cognitive dissonance the reason for harmful behaviors]]?
