#### [[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]], and our [[ego]] is the amalgamation of those [[defense-mechanisms]], ready to activate at anytime. If the trigger is strong enough, we can completely dissolve into our ego, lose connection to our true [[self]], and fallback to whatever [[coping-mechanisms]] we have developed without a chance to intercept and change them.

This is fundamentally a survival system: [[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]], but it is overactive because [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]]

Possibly
explained by:: [[The ego is the brain's response to the realization that we are just another individual in the world]].
