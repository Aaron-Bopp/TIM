#### [[Buddhism outlines a path and practice to end suffering, but does not promise it]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Buddhism outlines this Eightfold path [^1] which leads to the end of [[suffering]] through reaching [[enlightenment]]
- Right Understanding
- Right Thought
- Right Speech
- Right Action
- Right Livelihood
- Right Effort
- Right [[mindfulness]] 
- Right Concentration[^2]

If these are followed you have a chance of reaching [[enlightenment|Nirvana]] in this life this path contrasts [[Worldviews are wrong if they make life seem easy and simple|worldviews that make life seems easy and simple]]. [[Buddhism outlines a path and practice to end suffering, but does not promise it]]

I find this beautiful because [[True optimism is acknowledging the suffering of the world and defying it anyway]]
