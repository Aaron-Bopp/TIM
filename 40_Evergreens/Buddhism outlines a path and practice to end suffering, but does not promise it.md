#### [[Buddhism outlines a path and practice to end suffering, but does not promise it]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

If we believe [[Hope is not optimism it is a practice for producing change]] and [[Knowledge of the world is painful]], then our only conclusion can be that [[True optimism is acknowledging the suffering of the world and defying it anyway]]

However, [[Buddhism]] doesn't promise any ability to achieve that change, it merely gives us the strength to push forward, because
[[Buddhism is the study of happiness through detachment]]

Buddhism outlines this Eightfold path [^1] that if followed leads to the end of personal [[suffering]] through reaching [[enlightenment]]
- Right Understanding
- Right Thought
- Right Speech
- Right Action
- Right Livelihood
- Right Effort
- Right [[mindfulness]] 
- Right Concentration

This contrasts [[Worldviews should not make life seem easy and simple|Worldviews that make life seems easy and simple]] because
it lays out a difficult path to gain your eternal reward and does not promise immediate effects.
[[Worldviews should be open ended and adaptive]]

These are similar to the [[Yama]] of [[Raja Yoga]]
