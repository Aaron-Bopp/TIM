#### [[What is the cognitive effect of living in an unjust world]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`



%% #TO/DO/FIND story, Need to establish that the world is unjust%%

%%There is more that one answer, how should they be represented? #TO/PONDER/ME %%

%%What is the conclusion%%

Possible Answers: 
- [[Humans have decided to reject an unjust world]]
	- [[Faith is an abstraction of cognitive dissonance]]
- [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]]
- [[The injustice of endurance]]
- [[Stupid rules are made to be broken]]
- [[Humans have decided to take advantage of an unjust world]]
- [[Humans try really hard to avoid understanding their mistakes]]
- [[Humans long to know what to do]]
- [[Humans are addicted to believing]]

Over all, [[Humans have decided to reject an unjust world]], but this manifest in many different forms:
- [[negative utilitarianism]] ^[[[articles_My moral code - Inverted Passion]]] is the belief that we need strive to reduce harm over everything else
    - This assumes that people will act rationally and want to reduce their own [[suffering]], but that isn't always the case: [[Sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion]] 
%%I don't think this is the answer. Doing good feels more effective than reducing harm, but trying to do good and failing can increase harm. What is the logical end of these beliefs?%%

We know that [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]] and we must keep that in mind when we are striving for [[society|societal]] change and [[self-actualization|personal]] change.

- [[What is the difference between optimism and hope]]

	- [[Hope is not optimism it is a practice for producing change]]
	- [[Empathy isn't understanding how you would make the decision it's understanding why they made the decision]]
- [[Anger fuels change]]
- [[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things]]
	- [[Stereotypes are social constructs]]
	- [[Humans love to group eachother]]
	- [[Stupid rules are made to be broken]]
