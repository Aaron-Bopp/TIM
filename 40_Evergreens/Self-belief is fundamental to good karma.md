#### [[Self-belief is fundamental to good karma]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Karma is based in the law of cause and effect]], so every action we take has an impact in the world, but [[Karma Fal]] is the belief that we have no control over those impacts, only our actions:
[[You can't control what happens you can only control what you do]]

Thus [[self-belief]] is vital to have good karma as we must believe that we have the capability to continue pursuing right actions no matter the outcome:
[[Right kinds of thoughts lead to right kinds of actions]]

- [[Buddhism outlines a path and practice to end suffering, but does not promise it]]
- [[The most reliable path to success is repeatedly trying to succeed]]
- [[Be the change you want to see in the world]]
- [[Meditation is a practice to develop a stronger conscious]]
