#### [[Self-belief is fundamental to good karma]] 

[[Karma is based in the law of cause and effect]], so every action we take has an impact in the world, but [[Karma Fal]] is the belief that [[You can't control what happens|we have no control over those impacts, only our actions]].
Thus, [[self-belief]] is vital to having good [[karma]] as we must believe that we have the capability to continue pursuing right actions no matter the outcome.
^[Part of this is controlling our thoughts because [[Right kinds of thoughts lead to right kinds of actions]]]

This is 
part of:: [[Buddhism outlines a path and practice to end suffering, but does not promise it]]
There are actions you can pursue that will reduce [[suffering]], 
but the actual times and places that [[suffering]] is reduced is not guaranteed. 

[[The most reliable path to success is repeatedly trying to succeed]] 
and so believing in yourself is the best path to good karma and thus success.
Which makes this 
part of:: [[How to pursue the positive things in life]].
