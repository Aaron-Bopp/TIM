#### [[We learn by transforming information into understanding]] 

Since ancient times, [[Yogi|Yogis]] have separated knowledge into two parts: [[Jnana]] and [[Vidya]]. 
Vidya is objective observable information that we can share with others.
Jnana is our subjective understanding that information, that really can only arise from first-hand experience.
Two people can agree that a roller coaster is fun to ride and can tell their friends,
but you can't really understand what they describe until you ride it for yourself.
^[[[notes - Vidya and Jnana]] and [[notes - Knowledge of the Mind]]]
We know that this kind of [[information]] exists, 
but usually we think things math, science, and literature mainly involve [[Vidya]] and that there isn't any subjectivity to our understanding them.
This would make a teacher lecturing at you for an hour while you dutifully take notes, that peak form of [[learning]],
but in reality we rely on experience just as much for understanding a math equation as we do what it's like to ride a roller coaster.
Really, what the teacher is doing isn't the most import part of our learning, we are.

We can see this exemplified in [[Math is it's own language]]. 
When mathematicians talk with each other its not just about sharing information, it is about sharing understanding. #TO/TEND/WATER 

In order to learn, we need to not just to be memorizing, we need to be internalizing the information by connecting and contrasting it with other information, developing our information, and using it in unique ways. This is how we develop [[understanding]], and once we have understanding we are able to remember more effectively.

- [[How to understand what you read]] integral in getting new information and exemplifies a lot of this
- [[A second brain should mirror how we think]], what is understanding in the [[brain]]? #TO/PONDER/IDEA
