#### [[An increase in self-love and self-respect may lead to a decrease in productivity]] 

Once you free yourself of [[guilt]] and [[shame]] it may appear that you lose [[motivation]], but it is natural for someone who has been being chased for their entire life to stop for a breather once they realize they are safe.

The problem is that you have been running for your entire life just and now that you are taking a break everybody else looks at you like you are a failure for not keeping up up with your "potential".

- part of:: [[Neurodiverse people are siloed into systems that work against them]]
	- [[Neurodiverse people can use their brain to their advantage]] *sustainably* only if they are able to foster [[self-love]]
	- [[Neurodivergent people cannot stop their brain from solving problems]] often contributes to this. We put our brain's to work people-pleasing instead of prioritizing ourselves.

> You can get it back with proper fostering of intrinsic motivation...If you disarm the fear and shame responses, you need to do it in tandem with building up [[self-belief]]. This is why I think coaching helps for a lot of people.
