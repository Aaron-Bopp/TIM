#### [[The ultimate goal of the mind is to keep thinking]] 

Otherwise, we wouldn't be here. This must be a
result of:: [[Humans are a product of evolution]]

Leads to::
- [[Humans are addicted to believing]]
- [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]]
- [[The brain is powerful enough to create supernatural experiences]]
- [[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things]]
- [[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]]

keep in mind:: [[Biological processes can only give context to behavior not predict it]]
