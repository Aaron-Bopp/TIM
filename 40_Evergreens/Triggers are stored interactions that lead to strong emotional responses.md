#### [[Triggers are stored interactions that lead to strong emotional responses]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Even if the moment it brings back to you wasn't specifically traumatic, the dissonance between that moment and your current beliefs may be triggering of other emotional reactions.
