[[Social anxiety isn't irrational it's just overcompensation]],
if you can acknowledge that what your [[anxiety]] is telling you could happen but will not certainly happen you can start to make the [[judgement|judgment]] on whether you should go through with the thing or not. 

Being able to do this requires a very healthy amount of [[mindfulness]], and a large amount of [[self-awareness]]. Once you've achieved these things your [[anxiety]] can start to be an aspect of your [[mindfulness]] rather than an inhibitor:
[[Anxiety should be a tool at your disposal not an impedance to your life]]

[[Meditation]] can help to do this: [[Meditation helps us regulate our nervous system]]

[[Anxiety]] can be very overwhelming because you are getting a non-stop feed of every negative situation that could happen. These thoughts can often feel very irrational because we know that not every bad thing will happen, but our [[subconscious]] does not know that. In turn, [[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]]

The reason this happens is rooted in [[Neuroscience]]. 
[[Anxiety]] is at it's core a warning system, which means that it is a big part of [[human survival]]/[[human advancement]].
^[[[Humans are a product of evolution]]]  
%% 
#TO/TEND/MULCH As we satisfy more and more of the [[Hierarchy of needs]] our need for such an advanced warning system grows less and less.
^[[[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do#Cause material insecurity]]]
%% 
In modern society, our [[anxiety]] can seem like a irrational response, but it is just our brain doing what is has evolved to do. 
%%
#TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH Is modern over compensation or just the next natural step in human [[Evolution]].

#TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH is there a threshold where so many of you [[Hierarchy of needs]] are met that you have no choice but to fall into [[existential dread]]

#TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH Is [[anxiety]] purely involuntary or can it come out of obsessiveness/[[OCD]]?
%%

[[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]].
