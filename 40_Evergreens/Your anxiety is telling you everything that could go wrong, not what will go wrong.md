#### [[Your anxiety is telling you everything that could go wrong, not what will go wrong]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Anxiety]] can be very overwhelming because you are getting a non-stop feed of every negative situation that could happen. These thoughts can often feel very irrational because we know that not every bad thing will happen, but [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]]. The truth is the [[brain]] has used [[Physiologic Anxiety]] to survive for millions of years, because [[Our brains are built around survival]].
The problem comes from [[Cognitive Anxiety]], which in lieu of real life threats, identifies everything as a life threat: 
[[Most anxiety isn't irrational it's just overcompensation]]

#TO/WRITE what is bad about this
- [[Anxiety prevents us from living in the present]]
- [[Anxiety causes us to reject nuance]]

If you can acknowledge that what your [[anxiety]] is telling you could happen but will not certainly happen you can start to make the [[judgement|judgment]] on whether you should go through with the thing or not. 
[[Attachment fuels anxiety]] 
and [[Anxiety stems from a lack of confidence for the future]]
so if we giving into our anxiety means latching onto *every possible thing that could go wrong.*

Being able to do this requires a very healthy amount of [[mindfulness]], and a large amount of [[self-awareness]]. Once you've achieved these things your [[anxiety]] can start to be an aspect of your [[mindfulness]] rather than an inhibitor:
[[Anxiety should be a tool at your disposal not an impedance to your life]]

[[Meditation]] can help to do this: [[Meditation helps us regulate our nervous system]]

This is made worse when the sources of your anxiety aren't obvisou: [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]].
