#### [[Your anxiety is telling you everything that could go wrong, not what will go wrong]] 

[[You don't want to jump off the cliff you're just afraid of falling]], you don't want to drive into traffic you're just staying vigilant, those thoughts are just warning signs from the [[brain]].
Really all anxious thoughts are just warning signs
because:: [[Anxiety is a defense-mechanism of the brain]].
We are used to our brain's giving us warning signs, but when the line isn't as clear between what you should and shouldn't do, [[anxiety]] can easily develop into a state of alarm.

[[Anxiety]] can be very overwhelming because you are getting a non-stop feed of every negative situation that could happen. These thoughts can often feel very irrational because we know that not every bad thing will happen, but [[Anxiety tries to make us assume the worst]].
The truth is the [[brain]] has used [[Physiologic Anxiety]] to survive for millions of years,
because:: [[Our brains are built around survival]].
The problem comes from [[Cognitive Anxiety]], which in lieu of real life threats, identifies everything as a life threat. 
^[To put this in perspective [[The advent of farming lead to increased prevalence of anxiety]]. We have been dealing with [[Cognitive Anxiety]] for 10,000 years at least, but we have been dealing with [[Physiologic Anxiety]] for more than 300,000 (or really since mammals developed the [[Limbic System]] 150 million years ago)]


[[Anxiety stems from a lack of confidence for the future]]
so giving into our [[anxiety]] means latching onto *every possible thing that could go wrong in the future.*
Then, [[Attachment fuels anxiety]], so as we start to become invested in future events our anxiety only gets worse.
This works in a [[feedback loop]] causing us to imagine worse and worse scenarios. 
As we endlessly search for some way to get rid of this feeling, we lose the ability to think about anything but the future.
This is 
how:: [[Anxiety prevents us from living in the present]].

Thankfully,
[[Most anxiety isn't irrational it's just overcompensation]].
If you can acknowledge that what your [[anxiety]] is telling you could happen but will not certainly happen you can start to make the [[judgement|judgment]] on whether you should go through with it or not. 

Being able to do this requires
a large amount of [[self-awareness]],
and a very healthy amount of [[mindfulness]].
^[[[Meditation]] can help with both of these things: [[Meditation helps us gain control over our emotions]]]
Once you've achieved these things your [[anxiety]] can start to be an aspect of your [[mindfulness]] rather than an inhibitor, making this a
part of::  [[Anxiety should be a tool at your disposal not an impedance to your life]]

This is 
made worse by:: [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]] 
as not being able to understand the root of why you're anxious 
isn't going to change the amount of anxiety your feeling.
