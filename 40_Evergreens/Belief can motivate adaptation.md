#### [[Belief can motivate adaptation]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

In modern times we still cling to [[religion]] because [[Belief helps us push through hardship]], but the roots of this trait go beyond any individual [[religion]]. 

It does not matter if the thing you are believing in is true; as long as it motivates [[behavior]] that is adaptive,
that [[belief]] is adaptive.
This 
explains:: [[Belief helps us push through hardship]]

- enabled by:: [[Wonder motivates us to interact with the world around us]]
- contrasts:: [[The injustice of endurance]]
- enhanced by:: [[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]]
