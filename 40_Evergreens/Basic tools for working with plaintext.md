#### [[Basic tools for working with plaintext]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Being able to programatically process information can be an incredible boon for knowledge workers. Learning some of these tools will immediately expand the possibilities of what information you can access.  
^[[[Note storage is important because it defines how you access and retain knowledge]]]

Now if you are ready to learn or just need to brush up on your skills, here are some resources:
- [[Regex]] is excellent for recognizing patterns and structures in [[markup]] languages or code: [[Regex#Getting started]]
- [[Python]] is an easy to read and write programming language that is profficient and manipulating text: [[Python#Getting started]]
    - #TO/DO/FIND Good resource for python basics so that people can better understand gh gists
- [[Github]] is excellent for quick iteration when manipulating text programmatically. You can commit changes before you make changes so that you can easily revert: [[Github#Getting started]]
- [[Obsidian (software)#Getting Started]]
- A tool for search and replace across multiple files, preferably with [[Regex]], I use [[Visual Studio Code]]
