#### [[You don't want to jump off the cliff you're just afraid of falling]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

> People were misinterpreting a safety signal from their brains...In that situation (when you're on a cliff, or a bridge, or driving past an oncoming car), your mind is actually saying, ‘You’re in an unsafe situation—back up from the ledge.’ [People] can misinterpret that and think, ‘I must have reacted that way because I wanted to jump...’ People who are more sensitive to symptoms of [[anxiety]]...are more likely to [[experience]] [high places phenomenon] than those who are less sensitive (though this only applies if they’ve never thought about [[suicide]])"

This is
part of:: how [[Our brains are built around survival]].
Our brain is sending us signals to keep us alert to danger, but because we have developed [[consciousness]] we interpret this differently.

This also 
explains:: [[Your anxiety is telling you everything that could go wrong, not what will go wrong]]
