#### [[Why is evergreen note-taking SO GOOD]] 

Have you ever spent the night going down a wikipedia rabbit hole only to forget most of what you had learned in the next days or weeks?
Have you ever felt like you're relearning everything everytime I take a math or science class?
Are you scared that you are going to lose everything that you learned school or are unsure of how to continue learning without teachers and assignments?
Do you feel like you have to wade through a mental fog whenever you try to understand something, ever your own opinions?
Do you save articles and youtube videos, promising that you are gonna actually use them one day?
Do you want to get more value out of what you read or to actually understand?

How the hell do we understand anything, ever?

You actually didn't learn anything in school. That's not to say school didn't teach you anything, but most of your learning actually happened here (in your bed sleeping)
