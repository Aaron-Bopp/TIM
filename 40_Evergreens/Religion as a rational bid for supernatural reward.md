#### [[Religion as a rational bid for supernatural reward]] 

This is 
part of:: [[What is the origin of religion]]
and is 
explained by:: [[rational choice theory]].
It would posit that the origin of [[religious belief]] is in human intentionality to get obtain rewards that we cannot get on our own. 
We do this all the time to conserve energy, i.e. why do something yourself when there is someone our there who can do it better,
but for things like life after death and or even better weather for [[farming]] 
or good fortune in battle,
religion can be seen as a rational attempt to do this.
This is also unique because it is a explanation of [[religion]] that some believers would agree with.
While they would usually not say that they only believe for this reward,
they would definitely cite it as source of [[hope]] and thankfulness.

[[Darwin's Cathedral by David Sloan Wilson]] points out that this view of religion is not adaptive, as the reward is never actually delivered because of [[belief]],
but as a byproduct. While this is a valid explanation, and supported by evidence like [[Belief can motivate adaptation]],
there may be a better solution such as 
[[Religion as a group level adaptation]].
