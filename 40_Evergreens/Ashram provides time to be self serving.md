#### [[Ashram provides time to be self serving]]

This is an important insight for those who have been taught that the only purpose of life is to serve others. 
While [[Ashram]] agrees that serving others is important, it relegates it to a different part of life ([[Vanaprastha Ashram]]) than for serving your self ([[Grahastha Ashram]]).

This is 
part of:: [[How to discover your purpose in life]]
and is 
impacted by:: [[Purpose is derived from within, duty is derived from without]]
