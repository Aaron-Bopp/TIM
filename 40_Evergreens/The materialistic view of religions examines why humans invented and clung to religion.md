#### [[The materialistic view of religions examines why humans invented and clung to religion]] 

If god doesn't exist,
why do we have so many [[religion]]'s,
why do so many people have spiritual experiences,
and why does [[religion]] persist as scientific explanations become more common?

If [[Humans are a product of evolution]], there must be an adaptive reason that we are so religious.

One basic answer is that
religion fulfills people's basic needs, [[Community]], tradition, etc., and it answers [[The three main questions of life]]. The religions that are most popular today are the ones that answers those questions well and have beliefs that are designed to keep people in the have. 

However, the rabbit hole goes much deeper than that.

##### [[Humans are addicted to believing]]
It's not just that we look to [[religion]] in times of hardship, we are addicted to [[belief]]. 
This may be a result of [[wonder]] being one of our most basic instincts:
[[Wonder motivates us to interact with the world around us]]

There are two things about religion and belief that show this addiction:
- [[Belief helps us push through hardship]].
- [[A conversion experience can help us reshape our sense of self]]

As opposed to a more social answer, these things are personal. We want to succeed and [[A secure worldview is the best defense against existential dread]].

[[The brain is powerful enough to create supernatural experiences]]

##### [[Religion promotes high social control]]
[[Social control promotes highly altruistic behavior within groups]]
[[Social order is built off of a shared belief in an imagined reality]]
