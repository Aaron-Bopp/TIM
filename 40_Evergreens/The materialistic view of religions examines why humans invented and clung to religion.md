#### [[The materialistic view of religions examines why humans invented and clung to religion]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

One thing I have enjoyed since leaving the church is thinking about a materialistic view of [[religion]]. If god doesn't exist, why do we have so many [[religion]]'s, why do so many people have spiritual experiences, and why does [[religion]] persist as scientific explanations become more common. My personal belief is the reason that [[religion]] is so successful is because it fulfills a lot of the people's basic needs. Community, tradition, etc and it answers [[The three main questions of life]]. The religions that are most popular today are the ones that answers those questions well and have beliefs that are designed to keep people in the have.
