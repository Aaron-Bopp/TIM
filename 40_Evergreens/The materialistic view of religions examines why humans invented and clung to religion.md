#### [[The materialistic view of religions examines why humans invented and clung to religion]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

One thing I have enjoyed since leaving the church is thinking about a materialistic view of [[religion]].
If god doesn't exist,
why do we have so many [[religion]]'s,
why do so many people have spiritual experiences,
and why does [[religion]] persist as scientific explanations become more common?

My personal belief is the reason that [[religion]] is so successful is because it fulfills a people's basic needs, [[Community]], tradition, etc., and it answers [[The three main questions of life]]. The religions that are most popular today are the ones that answers those questions well and have beliefs that are designed to keep people in the have. 

These three questions are such a powerful draw because they 
%%answer [[What is the cognitive effect of living in an unjust world]], ?%%
feed into:: [[Humans are addicted to believing]]

While the discussion of what individual religions bring to the table can get quite specific, I think in general it comes down to the fact that [[Belief pulls you forward into life]].
