#### [[The materialistic view of religions examines why humans invented and clung to religion]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

If god doesn't exist,
why do we have so many [[religion]]'s,
why do so many people have spiritual experiences,
and why does [[religion]] persist as scientific explanations become more common?

If [[Humans are a product of evolution]], there must be an adaptive reason that we are so religious.

One basic answer is that
religion fulfills people's basic needs, [[Community]], tradition, etc., and it answers [[The three main questions of life]]. The religions that are most popular today are the ones that answers those questions well and have beliefs that are designed to keep people in the have. 


feed into:: [[Humans are addicted to believing]]

While the discussion of what individual religions bring to the table can get quite specific, I think in general it comes down to the fact that [[Belief pulls you forward into life]].
