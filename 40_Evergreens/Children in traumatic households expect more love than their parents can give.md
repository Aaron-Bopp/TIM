#TO/DO/FIND Dr.K qoute about all children being [[trauma|traumatized]]

This is because the reason the child's home is traumatic is because of the [[parents]] and there is no way the parents can overcome this. The parents are unable to give [[unconditional love]] because they are showing that there are conditions where they do not love the child. If parents [[Parents need to model the ability to deal with emotion to their children|model the ability to deal with emotion to their children]], then the child can be less traumatized.

[[A inwardly judgementful and outwardly accepting home creates trust issues]]
