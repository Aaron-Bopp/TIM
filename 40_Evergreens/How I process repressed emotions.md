#### [[How I process repressed emotions]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

1. Triggering event. Usually these happen it situations where I am [[masking]], so sometimes I don't really notice the event, but sometimes it will trigger [[Hypervigilance]]
2. Some amount of time of feeling low/shitty/meh. If the event was strong it can be short because I can recognize the event and can identify the emotion, but sometimes it builds over days and then I have to parse through everything that's happened to me to find the source
3. Recognizing/verbalizing the ACTUAL emotion, not the defense-mechanism produced feeling or rationalization. This usually involves breaking down the logic of my [[defense-mechanisms]]. It feels like a [[mindfullness]] exercise. What am I thinking about this feeling, how does that actually relate to the feeling, is it bringing out the feeling or pushing it back in.
4. Sob uncontrollably
5. Try to work through the emotion with healthily using [[self-love|self-validation]] like "It's okay" repeated over and over. 

###### Examples

1. Justin comes in from cooking burgers and replies sharply when one of the Kid's asks if we can watch Gravity Falls. I see that we are watching one of Justin's favorite movies so I tell the kids that we should just watch this. As we get our burgers my mind is racing trying to figure out a solution. I don't say anything to Justin or Jolene about the meal, because I'm not sure what will come off as condescending. We start to watch and I want to compliment Justin on the burgers, but I know how much it annoys him when people talk during movies. So I keep the kids quiet as we watch. Justin is intently focused on the TV as he eats then immediately gets up once done. I am in the kitchen getting a second burger, and as he walks past I tell him how good the burgers were. I got back to eating, the kids ask if we can watch something else and Justin has left so I say yes. I encourage Jimmy to finish his burger, because I don't want that to come up later. 

######
1. I have a work meeting where the agenda wasn't discussed beforehand, and nobody really knows what expect from the meeting. I am in charge, and ramble on about stuff, until other people intervene. 
2. Once the meeting is over I immediately feel bad, but I am consoling myself with phrases like, "I'd rather be the one answering questions wrong than fall behind," "I'd rather be over-explain than under-explain" but nothing is actually making me feel better. I go over to the dog and cuddle, but it doesn't help. As I explain the situation to Jolene I say these phrases and she says I sounded fine.
3. I go back to my computer and face away from Jolene, I think back over the meeting and think about how one of the speakers responded to me in the meeting. She responded with compassion and [[empathy]] and I could tell that she was trying to validate what I was saying and steer the meeting back to the right direction. I was thankful in the meeting, but now I felt angry. I was mad that she could tell I didn't know what I was talking about even though I had already recognized that fact. I didn't like feeling pitied? This lead to the thought, "It's okay to be stupid"
4. Sob uncontrollably
5. I repeated "It's okay to be stupid" to myself over and over, and tried to replace my feelings for the compassionate person with love instead of hate. 

######
1. Come out to my friends as [[transgender|trans]], but don't emphasize pronouns etc. (Scared because I don't want them to invalidate me-> repressed emotion). Get into the girls groupchat/they invite me on a shopping trip, but I don't feel like they are genuine/I don't feel like I am presenting correctly. Still feel like I'm just the boyfriends best friend
2. Feel worse and worse about it. Sit in bed for like 7 hours
3. Track it down to "I'm scared nobody will accept the true me" which doesn't really bring anything out until I add ", because [[my parents]] never loved the true (trans) me" 
4. Sob uncontrollably
5. Try to validate myself with "It's okay" and "you are loved" but it doesn't really hit, and then I start thinking about how even though some people will accept the true me, a large portion of the population won't.
