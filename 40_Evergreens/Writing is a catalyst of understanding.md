#### [[Writing is a catalyst of understanding]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Writing requires you to engage with the content on a higher level by introducing positive [[friction]]:
[[Good friction causes the brain to engage]]

I engage in two major kinds of [[writing]]
1. Writing to enable idea generation
2. Writing to clarify my thought process

These are both integral parts of [[understanding]].
Connections are how we remember things and ideas are usually connections between two ideas.

My thought process usually has gaps where I think I know what's coming next. Writing pokes holes where those are and filling them sometimes leads to new insights or at the very least makes these notes more readable.
[[Writing]] is good [[friction]], pushing myself to write out my thoughts makes me organize them and put them out linearly. This means I have to examine and understand the nature of links between different thoughts.

Writing also enables idea generation by effectively letting you "know" more things. Often when I write stuff down in my notes I already have a pretty good idea of what I think of them, but that I idea might fade. Writing it down, especially (and possibly only) in [[evergreen notes]] lets that idea grow over time.

- some people can't think unless they are writing

	- This is because [[Humans try really hard to avoid understanding their mistakes]], [[writing]] provides good friction that allows us to address our confusion
- [[Often the best editing tool is time]] 
	- this is how [[Evergreen notes help us bridge the gap between knowledge and understanding]]

This is why there is a difference between [[spaced repetition]] and [[incremental writing]] for me, even though I write during both.
[[incremental writing]] is to push me to write to clarify understanding, and [[spaced repetition]] is to help me write for idea generation.
