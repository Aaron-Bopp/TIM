#### [[Writing is a catalyst of understanding]]

I engage in two major kinds of [[writing]]
1. Writing to enable idea generation
2. Writing to clarify my thought process

These are both integral parts of [[understanding]].
Connections are how we remember things,
and insights are usually connections between ideas. 
My thought process usually has gaps where I think I know what's coming next. 
Writing forces me to fill those gaps
and find the best path to understanding.

Writing also enables idea generation by effectively letting you "know" more things. Often when I write stuff down in my notes, I already have a pretty good idea of what I think of them, but that idea might fade. Writing it down, especially (and possibly only) in [[evergreen notes]] lets that idea grow over time and provide insights over time.

This is why there is a difference between [[spaced repetition]] and [[incremental writing]] for me, even though I write during both.
[[Incremental writing]] is a time to fill holes and clarify understanding,
but spaced repetition is a time to connect thoughts and generate insights.

This is
how:: [[Evergreen notes help us bridge the gap between knowledge and understanding]].

I’ve read a bit into the Insight Problem Solving literature, and insight can be thought of as a representational change that leads to solutions, which is maybe a more rigorous way to say that “you suddenly notice what’s relevant to the problem at hand”.

Interconnected notes is a way to facilitate chunk decomposition, because an Evergreen note is similar to a chunk in that you can decompose it into other chunks which can help reconfigure your representation - or how you look at a problem. I think that’s how practicing PKM can facilitate the processes that yield insights.
