#### [[Parents will not be able to protect their children from every source of trauma]] 

- [[Children will not question what is modeled for them unless they are taught to]], they don't actually expect more love

#TO/TEND/PRUNE to generalize less
This is because the reason the child's home is traumatic is because of the [[parents]] and there is no way the parents can overcome this.
The parents are unable to give [[unconditional love]] because they are showing that there are conditions where they do not love the child. If parents [[Parents need to model the ability to deal with emotion to their children|model the ability to deal with emotion to their children]], then the child can be less traumatized.

- [[Overly interrogative parents can lead to alexithymic children]]
- [[Children make wide assumptions about the world]]

This is why [[A inwardly judgmental and outwardly accepting home creates trust issues]]
