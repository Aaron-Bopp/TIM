#### [[A totally integrated machine should automate as much of the thinking process as possible]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

If possible, you should not be the only thing inputting knowledge into your [[second brain]]. Services like [[Readwise]] can automatically export the highlight that you take from a variety of sources. While you are still the one your curating these highlights, [[Readwise]] will automate the process of creating notes for these highlights and you can adjust the format so that it is customized to work well with whatever tool you're using: [[Curate source notes and definitions in your second brain to avoid junk text]]

#TO/TEND/GRAFT 
- [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]]
- [[Evergreen notes should be constantly integrating new knowledge]]
- [[We will evolve when we make learning as easy as thinking]]
- [[Your second brain should be an inspirational hub of creativity]]
- [[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge]]
- [[A healthy second brain requires a surplus of entry points]]
- [[Note structures should help curate knowledge]]
