#### [[A totally integrated machine should automate as much of the thinking process as possible]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[There is a difference between thinking and creating]], and you should be automating as much unnescary thinking as you can so that you can spend more time making [[Your second brain should be an inspirational hub of creativity|your second brain and inspirational hub of creativity]]. This means spending less time trying to remember where you put something, figuring out what you want to work on, and doing basic manipulation to notes.

[[Conceptual notes]] means that information about any concept should be contained in an [[evergreen notes|evergreen note]], and that further knowledge should be just be links away. 
This is how [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]] 
and makes it easy to add new information:
[[Evergreen notes should be constantly integrating new knowledge]]

This goes for your actual [[note writing]] as well as 
[[Note structures should help curate knowledge]].

Often much energy is taken up trying to figure out what you want to work on, rather than actually working which means
[[A healthy second brain requires a surplus of entry points]].
If you have many different ways to enter your brain it means that no matter what mood you're in, you have something that you can easily work on.

If possible, you should not be the only thing inputting knowledge into your [[second brain]]. Services like [[Readwise]] can automatically export the highlight that you take from a variety of sources. While you are still the one your curating these highlights, [[Readwise]] will automate the process of creating notes for these highlights and you can adjust the format so that it is customized to work well with whatever tool you're using: 
[[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge]]

While much knowledge is just a google away, it can be useful to have easily accessible information so you don't have to spend time looking things up.
You should be careful to 
[[Curate source notes and definitions in your second brain to avoid junk text]]
while you are doing this.

[[We will evolve when we make learning as easy as thinking]]
