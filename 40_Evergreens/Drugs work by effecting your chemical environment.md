#### [[Drugs work by effecting your chemical environment]] 

This is 
result of:: [[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]].
While people's [[material conditions]] play a large role in their mental health, drugs affect the chemical's inside our brain.
Both pharmaceutical [[drugs]] and [[herb]]s affect us by impacting the [[Neurotransmitter|neurotransmitters]] that transmit [[hormone|hormones]] like [[Dopamine]] and [[Serotonin]]. 
^[[[notes - Herbs for mental health]]] 
^[[[notes - Treatment Principles for Anxiety and Depression]]]

Another way that our [[body]] can effect our [[mood]] is through our [[brain-gut axis]]: [[Gut health directly impacts mental health]]

%% #TO/TEND/MULCH 
Because:: [[Doctor's can't prescribe improving your life]],
[[Drugs may be being overprescribed]].

This just doesn't just apply to pharmaceutical drugs.
[[Exercise]], [[meditation]], and [[diet]] also all have massive effects on your chemical environment.
This is 
why:: [[Yoga is a wholistic philosophy of self-improvement]].
