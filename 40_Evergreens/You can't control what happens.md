#### [[You can't control what happens]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Success comes from focusing on actions not outcomes. 
[[Motivation and obsession are indistinguishable to an outside perspective]] because motivation is just focusing on task until it's completion.

Because [[Right kinds of thoughts lead to right kinds of actions]], this means keeping one thought in our mind until it becomes real, or [[manifestation]], is the same thing as [[motivation]].

- [[Self-belief is fundamental to good karma]]
- [[Accepting responsibility is not only about your actions]]
- [[Be the change you want to see in the world]]
- [[Purpose is derived from within, duty is derived from without]]
- [[A story will either end where it began, or somewhere else]]
