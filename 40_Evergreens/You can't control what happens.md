#### [[You can't control what happens]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This is the concept of [[Karma Fal]], which states that you are not entitled to the outcome of your action, only the action itself.
This is something I personally struggle to believe, 
but I can acknowledge that
[[The most reliable path to success is repeatedly trying to succeed]].

#TO/TEND/MULCH 
[[Motivation and obsession are indistinguishable to an outside perspective]] because [[motivation]] is just focusing on task until it's completion and focusing on the outcomes can actually lead to [[anxiety]] instead of [[motivation]]:
[[Anxiety prevents us from living in the present]]

Because [[Right kinds of thoughts lead to right kinds of actions]], this means keeping one thought in our mind until it becomes real, or [[manifestation]], is the same thing as [[motivation]].

#TO/TEND/GRAFT 
- [[Self-belief is fundamental to good karma]]
- [[Accepting responsibility is not only about your actions]]
- [[Be the change you want to see in the world]]
- [[Purpose is derived from within, duty is derived from without]]
- [[A story will either end where it began, or somewhere else]]
