#### [[You can't control what happens]] 

This is the concept of [[Karma Fal]], which states that you are not entitled to the outcome of your action, only the action itself.

If we want to be
part of:: [[Be the change you want to see in the world]], 
we need to subscribe to
[[Purpose is derived from within, duty is derived from without]].
It is only by continually focusing on one idea that we can ensure success, which is
how:: [[The most reliable path to success is repeatedly trying to succeed]].

- interesting parallel:: [[A story will either end where it began, or somewhere else]]
