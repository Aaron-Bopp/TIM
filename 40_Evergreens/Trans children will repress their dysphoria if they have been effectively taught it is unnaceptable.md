#### [[Trans children will repress their dysphoria if they have been effectively taught it is unnaceptable]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

#TO/PONDER/ME My experience

[[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]] and [[Our understanding of gender begins at a very early age]], so it only follows that [[trauma]] related to our gender would cause use to repress and [[dissociation|dissasociate]], and this trauma does not require us actually verbalizing our need to transition. [[Parents need to model the ability to deal with emotion to their children]] and that includes confusion about [[gender]].

This is why [[You can discover your transness at any point in life]] and [[Any experience of gender is acceptable]]
