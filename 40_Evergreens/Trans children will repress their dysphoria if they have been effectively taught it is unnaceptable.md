#### [[Trans children will repress their dysphoria if they have been effectively taught it is unnaceptable]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

#TO/PONDER/ME My experience

 [[Our understanding of gender begins at a very early age]] and [[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]], so it only follows that [[trauma]] related to our [[gender]] would cause us to repress and [[dissociation|dissasociate]]. While having negative reinforcment makes this more likely to happen, [^1] because of the [[Gender self-socialization model]] we can still experience still repress these feelings of [[gender dysphoria]]: [[You can be taught to invalidate your own emotions]]

[^1]: [[Negative influences are stronger than positive influences]]

This means that even if your child never verbalizes their dysphoria, a toxic environment can still cause them to dissasociate. 
This is why [[You can discover your transness at any point in life]] and [[Any experience of gender is acceptable]]

[[Parents need to model the ability to deal with emotion to their children]] and that includes confusion about [[gender]].
[[Our authority figures curate and reinforce what we are allowed to imitate]], so even parents not educated their children of trans people can cause issues.
[[Studies show early acceptance of trans children normalizes mental health outcomes with peers]], so having an accepting [^2] home is vital.

[^2]: This has to be consistent: [[A inwardly judgementful and outwardly accepting home creates trust issues]]

Without early acceptance and especially with the onset of puberty, this repression will develop into stronger warning signs: [[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]]
