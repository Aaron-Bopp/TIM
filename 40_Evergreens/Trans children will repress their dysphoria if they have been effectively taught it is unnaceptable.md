#### [[Trans children will repress their dysphoria if they have been effectively taught it is unnaceptable]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

#TO/PONDER/ME My experience

 [[Our understanding of gender begins at a very early age]] and [[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]], so it only follows that [[trauma]] related to our [[gender]] would cause us to repress and [[dissociation|dissasociate]]. Even if we never verbalized this our dysphoria because of the [[Gender self-socialization model]] we can still experience this.
 
 [[Parents need to model the ability to deal with emotion to their children]] and that includes confusion about [[gender]]. [[Studies show early acceptance of trans children normalizes mental health outcomes with peers]].

Without early acceptance and especially with the onset of puberty, this repression will develop into stronger warning signs: [[Biology supports the validity of trans people]]. This is why [[You can discover your transness at any point in life]] and [[Any experience of gender is acceptable]]
