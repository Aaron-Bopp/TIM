[[Our understanding of gender begins at a very early age]].

Even if your aren't [[transgender|trans]] you can still experience [[Gender Euphoria]] and [[gender dysphoria]] in a [[subconscious]] understanding of your [[gender]]'s interaction with society. While [[Gender is a social construct]] it still has very real impact on our [[human experience]].
