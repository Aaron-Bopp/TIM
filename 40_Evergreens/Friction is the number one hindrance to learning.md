#### [[Friction is the number one hindrance to learning]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

```ad-note
title: How does this apply to a [[second brain]]?
1. [[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge]]
2. [[Your second brain should be an inspirational hub of creativity]]
```

What causes friction?
- A difficult problem 
- Forgetting what you already learned 
- [[ADHD]] [^1]
- A bad learning environment [^2]
- A bad teacher
- Fragile tools [^3]

These force you to keep focusing back on the problem from distractions. Prerequisite knowledge you need, constantly shifting things in and out of your working memory, avoiding and pushing past loud noises or strong emotions, figuring out something you were told is wrong.

Good systems for learning reduce this friction:
- Libraries
- [[Adderall]]
- [[Spaced repetition]]
- Good teachers 
- Good systems ^[[[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]]] 
- Knowing your tools ^[[[Learning how systems work can be a gateway to creating thought]]]
- Breaking down problems into smaller pieces [^4] 

[[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge]]:
**[[We will evolve when we make learning as easy as thinking]]**
