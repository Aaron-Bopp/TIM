#### [[Friction is the number one hindrance to learning]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

What causes friction?
- A difficult problem ^[[['A difficult task is one that is easy to screw up even if you know what you're doing' - Nathan Eloe]]]
- Forgetting what you already learned 
- [[ADHD]] ^[[[ADHD is not a lack of attention it is a misplacement of attention]]]
- A bad learning environment ^[[[Sometimes we can't grow until we change our environment]]]
- A bad teacher
- Fragile tools 

These force you to keep focusing back on the problem from distractions. 
Prerequisite [[knowledge]] you need, constantly shifting things in and out of your working memory, avoiding and pushing past loud noises or strong emotions, figuring out something you were told is wrong.

Good systems for learning reduce this friction:
- Libraries
- [[Adderall]]
- [[spaced repetition]] ^[[[Use spaced repetition as a memory tool for your second brain]]]
- Good teachers 
- Good systems ^[[[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]]] 
- Knowing your tools ^[[[Learning how systems work can be a gateway to creating thought]]]
- Breaking down problems into smaller pieces ^[[[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]]] 

**[[We will evolve when we make learning as easy as thinking]]**

> [!note: How does this apply to a second brain]
> 1. [[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge]]
> 2. [[Your second brain should be an inspirational hub of creativity]]

##### Counter:: Friction can be used to engage the first brain

[[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]] and sometimes that just means being lazy. If we are too used to something, or do it a lot, our brain will start to skip over it to avoid spending unneeded energy. This can become a problem when the brain over uses this process, and we start skipping over things we actually need to think about.
