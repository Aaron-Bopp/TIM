#### [[A repressed self creates a mistrust of self-love and self-esteem]] 

If your sense of self is [[repressed]] then it is unlikely that you have ever been able to interact with the world in a way that works.
This means that you haven't developed an [[identity]] that lines up with your true [[self]] because
[[Identity is your understanding of yourself vs your interaction with the world]].
At this point your [[ego]] may construct an [[identity]] that matches your interaction with the world: 
[[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]]

 #TO/PONDER/IDEA what does a repressed self look like?
 
[[A secure identity is the best defense against social anxiety]], because 
[[Confidence comes when you are more capable of handling diverse outcomes]].
But if you have a repressed [[identity]], you were never able to develop that [[confidence]], and likely feels large amounts of [[social anxiety]] because
[[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]]

This is 
part of how:: [[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]].
The [[ego]] used our [[insecurity|insecurities]] to construct our [[identity]] because our true [[self]] was [[repressed]].

Reasons for this likely come from the home, as that is where a lot of initial invalidation can happen: 
[[A inwardly judgmental and outwardly accepting home creates trust issues]]
This is why::[[Parents need to model the ability to deal with emotion to their children]]

A repressed [[self]] usually leads to issues with presentation so it is 
important to remember:: [[Presentation is the realization of our self-perception and identity is the realization of our self-image]]
