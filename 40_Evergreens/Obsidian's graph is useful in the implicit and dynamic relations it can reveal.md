#### [[Obsidian's graph is useful in the implicit and dynamic relations it can reveal]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

First: Maximize link force, minimize link distance, and find a balance between repel force and centering force where you can start to see groupings of related notes. You may need to filter out large index's or add links to get groupings to appear. The more links there are the "stiffer" the graph will become and the clearer you will see groupings of notes.

This will work somewhat for just [[evergreen notes]], but will work even better if you have [[topic notes]] or [[stub notes]] that naturally appear in notes without you having to think about linking them (you still need to create the links, either with the outgoing links' pane, scripts, or manually). 
^[There are some risks with this approach. Many [[topic notes]] will appear in many different contexts, diluting the meaning of the link. One way to get around this is to [[Distinguish between purposeful tagging and coincidental tagging of information]]]
 Maps of content can either be helpful or hindering, depending on how many you have and how many notes link out of each one. 
 
There will start to be noticeable structures:
- Large topics get pulled into the center of related notes, while smaller topics pull at the outside.
- Related areas will pull together, but as notes become more granular they will form distinct regions
- New areas of study/thought can be seen as peninsulas and islands
- Interdisciplinary notes can be seen as connecting two largely separate topic groups. 

These relations become more useful as your graph becomes larger, and your notes are more densely linked.
^[[[Densely linked webs of thought provide intuitive access to knowledge]]]
You should be surprised at the links and the closeness you are seeing between nodes, and often this only happen when you have so working in your vault frequently enough to forget how many links you add.

As you spend more time in the graph, you will start to recognize related structures of notes: three notes that are always in a line, two notes that are always right next to eachother despite not being linked. These show you implicit relationships that exist within your [[knowledge]]. 
As you add to your vault, you will be able to notice these structures shift and change, and you can ask why this is happening. 
^[While the goal is interconnect topics with enough links for the graph to be relatively static, [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]]. Observing the movement of notes over time can give insight to this.]
To see an idea of what this will look like take a look at my [[Graph Timeline]].

##### Counter:: Obsidian's graph is a distraction

Obsidian's graph is big a draw for newcomers, 
and I think with a certain style of [[note writing|note taking]]
it can be a very powerful tool, but it can also be a distraction.
^[[[Powerful tools make dangerous toys]] but [[Better tools allow us to be less disciplined and more productive]]]
If you have less than ~200 notes you will be tempted to overlink, 
to make notes just to add links to them,
and it will distract you from actually adding value to your vault.
Instead, focus on [[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest|Writing your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]].

However, if you are like me, this isn't going to dissuade you from focusing on the graph. 
Try not to overly fixate on the graph, but use it as [[motivation]] to work in your vault. Make the the graph a reward and suddenly it helps [[Your second brain should be an inspirational hub of creativity|your second brain become an inspirational hub of creativity]].
