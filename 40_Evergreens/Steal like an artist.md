#### [[Steal like an artist]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[Steal Like an Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative by Austin Kleon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13099738-steal-like-an-artist) book written (presumably) about this saying. Not sure if it originated with the author or not, but it does have the quality of being instantly understandable without much clarification.
