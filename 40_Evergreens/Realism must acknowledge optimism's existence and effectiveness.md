#### [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

As a realistic person, you cannot fall into the trap that [[Sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion]]. You should ask yourself, **who do I look up to**: the people who's realistic view of the world leads them to *inaction* or the people who's optimistic view of the world leads them to *action*?

If you are viewing the world through accurate realistic lens you must acknowledge the existence of optimism and the effect that optimistic people have on the world. People who have large affects of the world usually do so because they have a hopeful vision of how the world CAN be, not because they have an unrealistic view of how the world is. [[Hope is not optimism it is a practice for producing change]]. That realistic view is often where the [[Anger fuels change| anger that fuels change]] comes from.

Even if you think that optimism is ignorant it does not change the fact that optimism can lead to change. Even if optimism is ignorant it can still bring hope, and [[Hope is not optimism it is a practice for producing change]].
