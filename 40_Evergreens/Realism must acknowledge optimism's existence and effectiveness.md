#### [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

As a realistic person, you cannot fall into the trap that [[Sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion]]. You should ask yourself, **who do I look up to**: the people who's realistic view of the world leads them to *inaction*? or the people who's optimistic view of the world leads them to *action*?

If you are viewing the world through an accurate realistic lens you must acknowledge the existence of [[optimism]] and the effect that optimistic people have on the world. People who have large affects on the world usually do so because they have a hopeful vision of how the world CAN be, not because they have an unrealistic view of how the world is. This is
why:: we should [[Be the change you want to see in the world]]. 

[[Knowledge of an unjust world is painful]], and a realistic view of the world is often where the [[Anger fuels change| anger that fuels change]] comes from. 
[[Growing up is being able to articulate the hope more than the hopelessness]]. We can still be angry, and we should absolutely do something about it 
because:: [[Hope is not optimism it is a practice for producing change]]
