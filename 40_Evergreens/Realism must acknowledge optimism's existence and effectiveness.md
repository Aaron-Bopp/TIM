#### [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

As a realistic person, you cannot fall into the trap that [[Sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion]]. You should ask yourself, **who do I look up to**: the people who's realistic view of the world leads them to *inaction*? or the people who's optimistic view of the world leads them to *action*?

If you are viewing the world through an accurate realistic lens you must acknowledge the existence of [[optimism]] and the effect that optimistic people have on the world. People who have large affects on the world usually do so because they have a hopeful vision of how the world CAN be, not because they have an unrealistic view of how the world is. [[Be the change you want to see in the world]]. 

[[Knowledge of the world is painful]], and a realistic view of the world is often where the [[Anger fuels change| anger that fuels change]] comes from. 
Even if you think that optimism is ignorant it does not change the fact that optimism can lead to change. Even if optimism is [[ignorance|ignorant]] it can still bring [[hope]], and
[[True optimism is acknowledging the suffering of the world and defying it anyway]]
