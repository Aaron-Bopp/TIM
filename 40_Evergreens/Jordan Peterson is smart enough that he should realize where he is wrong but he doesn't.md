#### [[Jordan Peterson is smart enough that he should realize where he is wrong but he doesn't]] 

Peterson's works in psychology are generally respected, but his career is built off of his political and philosophical stances. 
Peterson has a very strong and one-dimensional understanding of how the world works, and has mostly written off any other viewpoints than his own.
Peterson is smart enough to recognize the logical fallacies that undermine what he has built his career off of,
but because he believes so strongly that the world works a certain way
he is unable to recognize the fallacies that require or come from that [[worldview]].

[[Being critical helps you develop understanding]] not just of things outside yourself, but of yourself.

- example of:: [[Searching for THE answer is dangerous]]
- example of:: [[Experts are often far too confident in the effectiveness of their theories]]
