#### [[Jordan Peterson is smart enough that he should realize where he is wrong but he doesn't]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

example of:: [[Experts are often far too confident in the effectiveness of their theories]]

[[Being critical helps you develop understanding]] not just of things outside yourself but of yourself.

Peterson is smart enough to recognize the logical fallacies that undermine what he has built his career off of,
but because he believes so strongly that the world works a certain way
he is unable to recognize the fallacies that require or come from that [[worldview]].

example of:: [[Searching for THE answer is dangerous]]
