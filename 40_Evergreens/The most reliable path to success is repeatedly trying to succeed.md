#### [[The most reliable path to success is repeatedly trying to succeed]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

It's not about being successful, it's about doing what you can do to get close to [[success]].

[[Motivation and obsession are indistinguishable to an outside perspective]] because [[motivation]] is just focusing on task until it's completion and focusing on the outcomes can actually lead to [[anxiety]] instead of [[motivation]].

Because [[Right kinds of thoughts lead to right kinds of actions]], this means keeping one thought in our mind until it becomes real, or [[manifestation]], is the same thing as [[motivation]].

[[Anxiety prevents us from living in the present]]
- [[Be the change you want to see in the world]]
- [[You can't control what happens]]
- [[Right kinds of thoughts lead to right kinds of actions]]
