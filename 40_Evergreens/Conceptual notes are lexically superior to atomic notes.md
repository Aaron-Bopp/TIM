#### [[Conceptual notes are lexically superior to atomic notes]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

You may be asking, aren't these the same concept? In theory yes, but atomic notes is a misnomer inspired by physical limitations that has affected the way people approach a [[Zettlekassen]] style [[knowledge management]] system. At first thought (unless you're a chemist) an atom is a uniformly sized building block. It never gets bigger, it never gets smaller, and it can fit together to create molecules. This is similar to the [[Niklas Luhmann]]'s original [[Zettlekassen]], which enscribed all notes on 3x5 cards and then layed them out to create large thoughts, but in the error of computer's this process is different. We no longer have the limitation of a small card that can easily fit into filing cabinets, and we no longer have access to the 3d plane. We can get very close to this system with computers, but we are wasting our time trying to recreate it exactly. Many thinkers in the [[knowledge management|PKM]] space have seen this. [[Andy Matuschak]] adjusted the concept to [[evergreen notes]], but still references atomic notes in his description. [^1] The problem with atomic notes is not so much in concept it is in how it plants itself in our minds. Because concepts are not uniformly sized or shaped. They haver rough edges and holes and don't always fit together nicely. The size of thought is not uniform. If we instead focus on concepts, we will have better success.
