#### [[Conceptual notes are lexically superior to atomic notes]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

I think that in name alone [[conceptual notes]] are superior to atomic notes. [[Names matter because they effect people's perception and understanding]] and the name atomic notes pushes you think about the physical size of the note, instead of the intellectual size of the note: [[Concepts are the fundamental unit of knowledge]]

At first thought (unless you're a chemist) an atom is a uniformly sized building block. It can vary a little big in size, but overall it's virtue is in it's uniformity.
In [[Niklas Luhmann]]'s original [[Zettelkasten]], he inscribed all notes on 3x5 cards and then laid them out to create larger thoughts.  This system restricted notes to a single atomic size, but in the era of computer's this process is different.
^[There doesn't mean there isn't anything to learn from Luhmann's system, but we shouldn't limit ourselves because of it: [[Better tools allow us to be less disciplined and more productive]]]
We no longer have the limitation of a small card that can easily fit into filing cabinets, and we no longer have access to the 3d plane. Trying to exactly recreate a [[Zettelkasten]] with these limitations would introduce [[friction]]: [[Friction is the number one hindrance to learning]]

This is why I always say [[conceptual notes]] instead of atomic notes: [[Concepts are the fundamental unit of knowledge]]
