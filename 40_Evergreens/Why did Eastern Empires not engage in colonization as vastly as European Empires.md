#### [[Why did Eastern Empires not engage in colonization as vastly as European Empires]]

In the early 1400s, the Chinese admiral [[Zheng He]] lead seven armadas totaling of 300 ships carrying over 30,000 people from China to Kenya and back. These forces were larger than any of the forces that conquered the Inca or Aztec Empires, and yet Zheng He did not topple thousands of years of history. Instead, he returned to China and his voyage was largely ignored when political tides changed.

Fast-forward to the late 1700s and Asia was by far the economic superpower, but over the next 200 years they would lose this largely because of European's relentless colonization.
Though eastern empires were not technologically inferior to European Empires, they did not use their technology to explore, conquer, and exploit the world as European's did in the 18th, 19th, and 20th century. 
^[It is only in the 21st century that China has started to catchup in this unfortunately competitive department #TO/DO/CITE ]

This raises the questions of what about Eastern Culture discouraged colonization for so long, and what in European Culture caused them to so quickly take advantage of their technological advantage.
