#### [[Gender Dysphoria is based in a intrinsic wrongness of self]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

```ad-warning
Remember, [[Any experience of gender dysphoria is acceptable]] and [[Any experience of gender is acceptable]] are still true. This is just one experience of [[gender dysphoria]].
```


 > In principle, [[Gender Dysphoria]] is a feeling of wrongness intrinsic to the [[self]]. There is no logical backing to this wrongness, there is nothing which explains it, you cannot describe why you feel this way, it is just there. Things in your existence are incorrect, and even knowing which things _are_ incorrect can be hard to properly identify.

This incongruity can create a frustration that is incredibly hard to root out and causes [[Trans people will look for any other solution than being trans]]

[[videoTransComingOutStory|Abigail Thorn]] relates the experience of being [[transgender]] to being assigned a crappy job at birth and then being told by everyone around you that you could never switch jobs. Not everything about the job is bad, and you even find joy in it, but it ways on you until you break, or give up, and while transitioning doesn't make everything instantly better it makes life so much more easy and bearable that you can finally start to enjoy it.
