#### [[The black identity has evolved past it's political origins]] 

#TO/PONDER/SOCIETY everything is political, so it really isn't significant that the black identity has political origins because so does every race's [[identity]].
^[[[Race is a social construct]]]
The important thing is to contextualize black people's [[experience]] in a political [[society]], and to recognize how the origins of race effect them specifically. The [[Black Identity model]] can be a useful tool to do this, but isn't the only one. 
[[Marginalized identities are inseparable from politics]]

%% #TO/TEND/MULCH 
The black identity is political because [[Race is a social construct]] but it is not only political, it has become a [[community]] and [[Communities are support systems]].%%

[[Colonization and slavery lead to generational disparities in black communities]], and [[Insecure material conditions increase cognitive load and reduce outcomes]] have lead to population wide [[inter-generational trauma]].
[[Stereotype threat]] and [[Microaggressions]] create common experiences among [[black people]] in [[America]] and across the world.
