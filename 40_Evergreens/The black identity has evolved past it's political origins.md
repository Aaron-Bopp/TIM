#### [[The black identity has evolved past it's political origins]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

The black identity is political because [[Whiteness was created to marginalize people of color]] but it is not only political, it has become a [[community]] and [[Communities are support systems]].

[[Colonization and slavery lead to generational disparities in black communities]], and [[Insecure material conditions increase cognitive load and reduce outcomes]] have lead to population wide [[inter-generational trauma]].
[[Stereotype threat]] and [[Microaggressions]] create common experiences among [[black people]] in [[America]] and across the world.
