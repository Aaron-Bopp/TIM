#### [[Our brain actively inhibits us from processing repressed emotions]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

#TO/WRITE how the brain lodges emotional reactions in our [[unconscious]] memory

The [[Association Cortices]] are what make the attachments that we use to survive
^[[[Humans are a product of evolution]]]
but they do that by lodging [[emotions]] in our [[subconscious]] called [[Samskara]].
If those attachments are left unchecked it can lead to very bad things 
^[[[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]]
but [[meditation]] allows us to gain [[control]] over our [[subconscious]] and [[detachment]] from those [[emotions]].

[[Meditation helps us detach negative attachments]]

- enables [[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]
