#### [[Consciousness is our capacity to introspect]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Many people think that [[conscious|consciousness]] is a fundamental part of [[humanity]], but I think that while humans are the only ones to achieve it, [[conscious|consciousness]] is variable within our species, just like our capacity to introspect: [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]]

The [[Yogi|Yogis]] observed that we can only [[perception|perceive]] things that are separate from us, so because we can perceive our own thought, our [[conscious|consciousness]] must be outside of the [[mind]].
^[[[notes_The Nature of Mind]]]
This would mean that if something is impairing our ability to observe our own thoughts we are less [[conscious]], 
and if we are able to more easily observe our thoughts we are more [[conscious]].

This is no new idea, and is the basis of much [[eastern philosophy]].
^[
[[Meditation is a practice and discipline of observation]]
and so it
it strengthens our ability to observe ourselves:
[[Meditation is a practice to develop a stronger conscious]]
]
The specific ability to introspect is called [[Sakshi Bhava]], or as it has been popularized in [[America]], [[mindfulness]]. 

[[Mindfulness]] is not just the ability to have thought. 
As anybody with [[anxiety]] will tell you, the thoughts in your [[mind]] are not always accurate.
^[[[Your anxiety is telling you everything that could go wrong, not what will go wrong]]]
[[Mindfulness]] is the ability to observe you thoughts, react to them without [[judgement]] or fear, and objectively decide your path forward.
[[Buddha]] stated that this was the only path to end [[suffering]] and reach [[enlightenment]]:
[[Buddhism is the study of happiness through detachment]]

Followed to it's conclusion [[mindfulness]] will allow you to calm your [[senses]],
^[[[Meditation helps us regulate our nervous system]] helps with [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]]]
heal [[childhood]] wounds,
^[[[Meditation helps us detach negative attachments]] helps with [[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]]
overcome our emotional [[rationalizations]],
^[[[Meditation helps us gain control over our emotions]] helps with [[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]]]
reach a [[flow state]] of [[friction|frictionless]] concentration,
^[[[notes_The Nature of Mind]] helps with [[We will evolve when we make learning as easy as thinking]]]
and finally a no-mind state known as [[Dhyana]].
