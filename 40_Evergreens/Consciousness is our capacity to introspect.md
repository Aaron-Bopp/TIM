#### [[Consciousness is our capacity to introspect]] 

Many people think that [[consciousness]] is intrinsic to [[humanity]],
but while humans are the only ones to achieve it,
[[consciousness]] is variable within our species,
just like our capacity to introspect.

The [[Yogi|Yogis]] observed that we can only [[perception|perceive]] things that are separate from us, so because we can perceive our own thought, our [[consciousness]] must be separate from the [[mind]].
^[[[notes_The Nature of Mind]]]
This would mean that if something is impairing our ability to observe our own thoughts we are less [[consciousness|conscious]], 
and if we are able to more easily observe our thoughts we are more [[consciousness|conscious]].

This is no new idea, and is the basis of much [[eastern philosophy]].
^[
[[Consciousness is the fundamental unit of existence]]
and 
[[The history of meditation is a mixture of science and spirituality]]
]
The specific ability to introspect is called [[Sakshi Bhava]], or as it has been popularized in [[America]], [[mindfulness]]. 

[[Mindfulness]] is not just the ability to have thoughts or to know that you have thoughts. 
As anybody with [[anxiety]] will tell you, the thoughts in your [[mind]] are not always accurate.
^[[[Your anxiety is telling you everything that could go wrong, not what will go wrong]]]
[[Mindfulness]] is the ability to observe you thoughts objectively, react to them without [[judgement]] or [[fear]], and decide your path forward.

[[Buddha]] stated that this was the only path to end [[suffering]] and reach [[enlightenment]]:
[[Buddhism is the study of happiness through detachment]]

Followed to it's conclusion [[mindfulness]] will allow you to calm your [[senses]],
^[[[Meditation helps us regulate our nervous system]] helps with [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]]]
heal [[childhood]] wounds,
^[[[Meditation helps us detach negative attachments]] helps with [[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]]
overcome our emotional [[rationalizations]],
^[[[Meditation helps us gain control over our emotions]] helps with [[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]]]
reach a [[flow state]] of [[friction|frictionless]] concentration,
^[[[notes_The Nature of Mind]] helps with [[We will evolve when we make learning as easy as thinking]]]
and finally a no-mind state known as [[Dhyana]].

[[Meditation is a practice to develop a stronger consciousness]]
