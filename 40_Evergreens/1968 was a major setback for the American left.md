#### [[1968 was a major setback for the American left]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Senator John Heinz says "1968 was a turbulent year. It was a year of fun and excitement. It was a year of tragedy, but it ended." Those on [[the left]] will remember 1968 for the loss of some of their most loved and progressive leaders. [[RFK]] was an ardent [[anti-war]] senator who could have won the election and ended the [[war]] while maintaining liberal leadership if he had not been assassinated in 1968. (Lecture 24, part 3, 1:00-2:30) [[MLK]] would have continued on to fight for [gurranteed minimum income](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/08/martin-luther-kings-economic-dream-a-guaranteed-income-for-all-americans/279147/) and a variety of other causes that could have helped shape the American view of [[poverty]] if he had not been killed in 1968. These deaths compounded with the deaths of [[Malcolm X]] and [[JFK]] would leave a vacuum of leadership on [[the left]]. (Textbook, pg 1040) These events combined with [[LBJ]]'s decision not to run for re-election (Timeline, 1968) and distress and chaos at the DNC (Lecture 24, part 3, 9:00-15:00) that lead to a weakened view of the [[Democratic]] party, and their loss in the 1968 election. Meanwhile, those on the right might view 1968 as a political triumph.

As a person on [[the left]], I don't view 1968 as a shattering of [[America]], but rather the infliction of a wound into the new flesh of a slightly less racist, slightly more caring country that had been growing since [[FDR]]. This wound would then be infected and rotted by corrupt politicians and corporate money for the next fifty years
