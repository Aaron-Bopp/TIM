#### [[Consciousness is the fundamental unit of existence]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`
"Sometimes it's easiest to take the chances that have the highest likelihood of failure" - [[DrK]] [Ludwig and Dr. K's Journey of Death and Consciousness - YouTube](https://youtu.be/CHzOedHm_kM?t=543)
 
The [[Yogis]] believed that [[conscious]] was outside of the mind because we are able to observer our own thoughts. We can only observe things outside of ourselves - [Ludwig and Dr. K's Journey of Death and Consciousness - YouTube](https://youtu.be/CHzOedHm_kM?t=3214)

Yogis concluded that there was no difference between dreams and reality

As you become less trapped in your mind, you become more [[conscious]]

[[conscious|consciousness]] is a skill and divinity is the goal... [[enlightenment]]?
