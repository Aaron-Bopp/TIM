#### [[Consciousness is the fundamental unit of existence]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[Ludwig and Dr. K's Journey of Death and Consciousness - YouTube](https://youtu.be/CHzOedHm_kM?t=4336)

Ancient [[yoga|Yogic]] tradition offers an alternative to traditional [[Western]] creation myths such as [[Christianity]]'s. Instead of an all-powerful, all-knowing, and frankly problematic god, 
^[[[The biblical Christian God is evil and does not deserve to be worshipped]]]
the universe was formed from an [[infinite]] sea of [[conscious|consciousness]] called [[Brahman]]

This sea coalesced to become [[energy]] which coalesced to become [[matter]].
^[[[notes_Metaphysics of Meditation]]]
This is how [[Meditation increases our ability to influence the world#On a spiritual level]],
and is surprisingly similar to the modern theory of [[the Big Bang]]

#TO/DO/FIND  quote "I think therefore I am"


%% #TO/TEND/WEED The only thing we can truly know is real is our [[perception]]. Our [[conscious|consciousness]] is the only thing we can guarantee. Yet our [[conscious]] is limited by our [[mind-body complex]].%%
As you become less trapped in your mind, you become more [[conscious]]:
[[Meditation is a practice to develop a stronger conscious]]

##### Counter:: Time is the fundamental unit of existence

This doesn't make sense for someone who believes in [[reincarnation]] and [[karma]], but for most people their time on earth is the only there concerned about. #TO/PONDER what are the effects of this [[belief]]
