#### [[Anxiety is a defense-mechanism of the brain]] 

- explained by:: [[Our brains are built around survival]] and [[Humans are a product of evolution]]
- part of:: [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]]

We can see how this 
explains:: [[Attachment fuels anxiety]],
as if we are attached to something our brain with want to protect against the grief of losing that thing.

Ideally,
[[Anxiety should be a tool at your disposal not an impedance to your life]], but 
because [[Our biology has not significantly changed for thousands of years]] 
this defense-mechanism mas become hyperactive 
resulting in:: [[Most anxiety isn't irrational it's just overcompensation]].
