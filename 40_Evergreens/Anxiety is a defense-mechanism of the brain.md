#### [[Anxiety is a defense-mechanism of the brain]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

We can see this in [[Attachment fuels anxiety]], as if we are attached to something our brain with want to protect against the grief of losing that thing.

- [[Our brains are built around survival]]
- [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]]
- [[Our brain actively inhibits us from processing repressed emotions]]
- [[Humans are a product of evolution]]

- [[Anxiety should be a tool at your disposal not an impedance to your life]]
- [[Most anxiety isn't irrational it's just overcompensation]]
- [[Your anxiety is telling you everything that could go wrong, not what will go wrong]]
