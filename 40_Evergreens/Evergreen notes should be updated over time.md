As you continue to spend time with your notes you will develop them, not just based on the idea's you had at the time, but on new ideas. As you reread over old notes you will find connections to new notes or old notes that you have new understanding of. In this way,
[[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]].

However at a certain point, you may feel that your

One way is to [[Use spaced repetition to weed your digital garden]].
This will not only make you aware of what [[information]] is in your [[second brain]], but also help you keep on top of updating it.
