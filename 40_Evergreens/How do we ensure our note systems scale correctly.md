#### [[How do we ensure our note systems scale correctly]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

- part of:: [[A totally integrated machine should be infinitely scalable]]

How do we test this theory?
How do we define [[scalability]]?

Folgezettel here refers to the ID system [[Niklas Luhmann]] used to place notes within his [[Zettelkasten]]. Exactly where the note was placed wasn't entirely important, rather that Luhmann had understanding of where larger topics were, and could enter at those places. This removes need to perfectly remember where a note is, you just need to have a general idea and then follow the links.
However, Folgezettel was an unchanging hierarchy that allowed for topics to be in certain places.
We work with no [[hierarchy]], and thus we need to have another way of finding our notes.

This is the idea of an [[organizational notes|organizational note]], which may not hold every note, but allows enough entry points to find the thoughts that aren't directly linked.
[[Densely linked webs of thought provide intuitive access to knowledge]]
