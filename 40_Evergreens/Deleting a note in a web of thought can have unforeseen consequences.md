#### [[Deleting a note in a web of thought can have unforeseen consequences]] 

When you create a note in a system like [[Obsidian (software)|Obsidian]] or [[Roam Research (software)|Roam Research]], you aren't just creating a file on your computer, or writing out some text, you are creating a universally accessible node that can have as much power as you give it. The data of this node is impermanent, it can be deleted at the click of a button, but when it is integrated into a [[second brain]], deleting it can have unforeseen consequences.

When you delete a file, connections that may have existed will disappear, resulting in a loss of data larger than just the data in the file. Whether it be the way that note pulled nodes together on the graph, or the fact that it had a tag that could then be autocompleted, deleting a note will have effects outside its contents. 
This can be used to your advantage, but when it is unintended it can be detrimental.
This is 
why:: you should [[Combine notes instead of deleting them to avoid ghost data in a second brain]].

This is not unique to computerized brains. 
Have you ever 
had a word stuck on the tip of your tongue? 
Remembered everything about an event except 
what happened? 
Our brains are made up of 
connections through neurons, 
and even if the destination is gone, 
the connection can remain.
So in a way this is
part of:: [[A second brain should mirror how we think]].
