#### [[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Humans are designed to make certainty out of uncertainty and find reasons for illogical decisions. Our brains are not designed for correcting the dissonance between thoughts and conclusions. If our brains were unable to create reasoning and thought processes for completely illogical conclusions we wouldn't be where we are today, because in cases of survival we must make choices regardless of how many options or how little information we have. [^1]  
- [ ] #TO/DO/EXPAND from on additional information in source

One such explanation is [[religion]] and how [[Faith is an abstraction of cognitive dissonance]]: [[The materialistic view of religions examines why humans invented and clung to religion]]

This is the fundamental fact behind [[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]], and a result of how [[Our brains are built around survival]]. 

For more:: [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]]
