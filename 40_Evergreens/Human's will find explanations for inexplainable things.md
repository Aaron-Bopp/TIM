#### [[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Humans are designed to make certainty out of uncertainty. This [[abstraction]] is what allow us to make progress everyday in a world where almost nothing make sense. If we had to answer the [[The three main questions of life]] every single morning, we would be paralyzed.  [^1] Our brains are not designed for correcting the dissonance between thoughts and conclusions. In fact, [[Humans are drawn to the unknown and repelled by the known]] as it means we don't have to grapple with the fact that [[Knowledge of the world is painful]]. 

This need to find explanations for things we cannot know is fundamentally human, and is the source of many of our problems and joys. It is why [[Humans transfer their wonder into creativity]], but is also why [[Social anxiety isn't irrational it's just overcompensation]]. 

For more:: [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]]
