#### [[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Humans are designed to make certainty out of uncertainty]].
This [[abstraction]] is what allow us to make progress everyday in a world where almost nothing make sense.
If we had to answer the [[The three main questions of life]] every single morning, we would be paralyzed with indecision.
In fact, being able to extrapolate [[information]] out of extremely little stimuli is what has allowed us to [[progress]] so far.

What comes from this?
- [[Humans are drawn to the unknown and repelled by the known]]
- [[Humans transfer their wonder into creativity]]
- [[Humans are addicted to believing]]
- [[Faith is an abstraction of cognitive dissonance]]
- [[Children make wide assumptions about the world]]

The reason that this trait is so fundamental to so many behaviors is because this is
part of:: [[Humans are a product of evolution]].
This is a very selectable trait and so the things it leads to become wide spread. Combined with the similar trait [[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]], this 
explains:: [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]].

This also leads some of the more harmful human behaviors.
- [[Race is a social construct]]
- [[Stereotyping has the psychological goal of comprehension and self-enhancement]]
- [[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]
- [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]]
- [[People are radicalized when they are convinced that change is out of their control]]
