#### [[Make your inbox into an entry point by integrating it with your second brain]] 

In a [[knowledge management]] system, an inbox is the method through which you receive and categorize items into your [[second brain]]. An entry point is a way that you find your way into the [[web of thought]] so that you can find the information that you want to find. 

In a typical inbox you may have things you haven't read, have skimmed but want to read again, or have read but haven't notated. These things can be entry points into your [[web of thought]] wherever they are, but by storing these potential items in your [[second brain]] you are able to integrate them into the same systems that make a [[second brain]] powerful.
^[[[my TO(DO) and EVER(GREEN) structure]] allows for this]

#TO/TEND/PRUNE 
However, because [[Nodes in the second brain are an abstraction of our first brain#Nodes in the second brain are more fragile than thoughts in the first brain]], 
by making your inbox a part of your [[second brain]] 
you are subjecting it to [[The fragility of information in knowledge management]].
Remember, [[Friction is a hindrance to learning]], 
but you can help alleviate this [[friction]] by
[[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge|making your second brain a curated base of knowledge]].

#TO/TEND/WATER about how use [[Dataview]] and [[Spaced Repetition (plugin)]]  and [[my TO(DO) and EVER(GREEN) structure]] to accomplish this

#TO/TEND/GRAFT [[A healthy second brain requires a surplus of entry points]]
