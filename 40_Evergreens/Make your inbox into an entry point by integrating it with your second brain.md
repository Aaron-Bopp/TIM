#### [[Make your inbox into an entry point by integrating it with your second brain]] 

In a [[knowledge management]] system, an inbox is the method through which you receive and categorize items into your [[second brain]]. An entry point is a way that you find your way into the [[web of thought]] so that you can find the information that you want to find. 

In a typical inbox you may have things you haven't read, have skimmed but want to read again, or have read but haven't notated. You can connect these ideas to your thoughts from wherever they are, but by storing these potential items in your [[second brain]] you are able to integrate them into the same systems that make a [[second brain]] powerful.

Remember, [[There is a limit to how much information you can process at once]].
By pulling too much [[information]] into your [[second brain]] you can fall into [[The Collector's Fallacy]], thinking that you don't have to process what you collect.
You can help alleviate this problem by working with 
[[A healthy second brain requires a surplus of entry points]].
Build systems that help you process information more quickly 
to [[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge|make your second brain a curated base of knowledge]].
