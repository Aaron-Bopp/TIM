#### [[What is the cognitive origin of our social order]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Yuval Noah Harari]] argues in his book [[reference_Sapiens|Sapiens]] that our [[social order]] is based of the [[Imagined reality]] that we share, thus creating an [[Imagined order]]. This leads to both the existence and maleability of [[society]].

While the ability to exist in this imagined order must have been there for our time as [[hunter-gatherers]],
^[[[books_Sapiens#^297681730]]]
it only came to govern our daily lives after [[The Agricultural Revolution]].
^[While, [[Hunter-gathers were capable of mass cooperation]], we did not make this cooperation a part over our every day survival, preferring stay in autonomous groups [[There is a limit to the size of a group ordered purely by personal communication]]]

Two solutions are proposed by Harari, mythology and cooperation.

He then cites [[Hammurabi's code]] and [[The Founding Fathers]] as examples, 
but I feel these more hit upon

leads to:: [[What maintains our social order]]

If the [[social order]] we are talking about is [[capitalism]] then the origin is assumed to be our cynical egotistic nature.
