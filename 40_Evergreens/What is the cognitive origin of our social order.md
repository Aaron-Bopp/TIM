#### [[What is the cognitive origin of our social order]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Yuval Noah Harari]] argues in his book [[reference_Sapiens|Sapiens]] that our [[social order]] is based of the [[Imagined reality]] that we share, thus creating an [[Imagined order]]. This leads to both the existence and malleability of [[society]].

While the ability to exist in this imagined order has been there since our time as [[hunter-gatherers]],
^[[[books_Sapiens#^297681730]]]
it only came to govern our daily lives after [[The Agricultural Revolution]].
^[[[Hunter-gathers were capable of mass cooperation]], but we did not make this cooperation a part over our every day survival, preferring to stay in autonomous groups: [[There is a limit to the size of a group ordered purely by personal communication]]]

Two solutions are proposed by Harari, [[mythology]] and [[cooperation]].

He then cites [[Hammurabi's code]] and [[The Founding Fathers]] as examples, 
but I feel these more hit upon [[What is the origin of social hierarchy]]
but that may be key in [[What maintains our social order]].
%% This kind of implies that social [[social hierarchy]] is a way of maintaining social order (which I guess it is) %%

##### Other explanations

If the [[social order]] we are talking about is [[capitalism]] then the origin is assumed to be our cynical egotistic nature.
