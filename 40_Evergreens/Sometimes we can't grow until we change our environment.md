#### [[Sometimes we can't grow until we change our environment]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Sometimes we don't know what is hurting us until we cut it off, and we can't gain perspective until we take a step back. [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]] and [[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]]. It can be very valuable to remove yourself from the range of the things that may be bringing you down because you don't even know what is bringing you down. [^1] 

[^1]: [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]]

#TO/TEND/WEED wording
When you are trying to work through trauma. Don't try to be a hero and or have your cake and eat it to. [[There aren't any downsides to working through trauma]], but it can involve of a lot of very difficult situations and feelings because [[Working through trauma can involve of a lot of letting go]]. 

[[Deconstructing your faith is like climbing through a jungle canopy]] reflects on this concept of stepping back to gain objectivity in relation to [[Deconstruction (Christianity)]]. 

#TO/TEND/GRAFT [[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]] and [[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]]. [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]]
