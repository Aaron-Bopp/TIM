#### [[Sometimes we can't grow until we change our environment]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Sometimes we don't know what is hurting us until we cut it off, and we can't gain perspective until we take a step back. 
[[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]], so
it can be valuable to change your environment, because you might not know what is bringing you down:
[[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]]

[[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]] so your [[anxiety]] and [[depression]] may just be your brain's way of dealing with your situation.
^[[[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]]]
You may be around people who negatively impact your [[mental health]].
Especially if you are finding yourself constantly making excuses for other people,
getting away from that environment may help you look at things objectively:
[[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]]

[[Deconstructing your faith is like climbing through a jungle canopy]] reflects on this concept of stepping back to gain [[objectivity]] in relation to [[Deconstruction (Christianity)]]. 

If there isn't anything in your physical environment, it could be your mental environment. 
There may be [[repressed]] [[trauma]] or just strong childhood emotions that is bringing you down 
^[[[Our brain actively inhibits us from processing repressed emotions]]]
[[It's always worth it to work through trauma]],
but it can involve of a lot of very difficult situations and feelings because 
[[Working through trauma can involve of a lot of letting go]].
