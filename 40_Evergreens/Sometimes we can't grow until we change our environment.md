#### [[Sometimes we can't grow until we change our environment]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Sometimes we don't know what is hurting us until we cut it off, and we can't gain perspective until we take a step back. [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]] and [[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]]. It can be very valuable to remove yourself from the range of the things that may be bringing you down because you don't even know what is bringing you down. When you are trying to work through trauma. Don't try to be a hero and or have your cake and eat it to. [[There aren't any downsides to working through trauma]], but it can involve of lot of very difficult situations and feelings because [[Working through trauma can involve of a lot of letting go]]. 

[[Deconstructing your faith is like climbing through a jungle canopy]] reflects on this concept of stepping back to gain objectivity as it relates to [[Deconstruction (Christianity)]].
