#### [[Proximate explanation never substitutes for ultimate explanation in Evolution]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

from:: [[Biological processes can only give context to behavior not predict it]]

Don't substitute the parts for the whole, because the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts.
While [[natural selection]] is driven by [[mutations]] in [[genes]], 
the selection takes place in the environment not in the genome.

This could be seen as an 
example of:: [[molecular genetics]] and [[Experts are often far too confident in the effectiveness of their theories]]
