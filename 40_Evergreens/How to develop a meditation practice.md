#### [[How to develop a meditation practice]] 

[[Consciousness is our capacity to introspect]], but the [[diversity]] of our experiences means that the ways that [[meditation]] will help us be introspective will differ.

^[[[notes - Different Meditative Styles]]]

We can try to match our [[meditation]] method with the way in which we struggle to understand ourselves. 
[[Zen]] helps you develop [[consciousness]] by making you aware of the input from your [[Indriya]].
[[Trataka]] helps you strengthen your ability to focus on one thing and allow your [[subconscious]] to be closer to the world.

In order to improve at meditation you need [[commitment]] and a little bit of [[belief]].
The key is to focus on the action not the goal.
The benefits of [[meditation]] will come but slowly and only if you keep up with it.
Don't set an abstract goal or focus on the outcomes.
[[You can't control what happens]], so just focus on what you can control, your actions.
^[[[notes - How to achieve]]]

If this doesn't sound easy this is why a strong [[community]] or [[Sangha]] around you.
A [[Sangha]] can prompt you to practice, help you learn the principles of [[meditation]] and help you through your struggles.
^[[[Communities are support systems]]]

It may take you a while to perceive the effects of [[meditation]], but over time it will improve your life:
[[Meditation improves mental, physical, and emotional health]]
and
[[Meditation increases our ability to influence the world]]
