#### [[How to develop a meditation practice]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

It will also be much easier if you have a strong [[community]] around you.
^[[[Communities are support systems]]]
#TO/PONDER/CONCEPT [[notes_Sangha]]

and it will shape your view of the world.
[[Karma is an open ended system of belief]]
