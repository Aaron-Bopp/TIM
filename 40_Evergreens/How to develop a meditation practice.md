#### [[How to develop a meditation practice]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

You need a good [[teacher]], [[commitment]], and a little bit of [[belief]]. 

The key is to focus on the action not the goal.
The benefits of [[meditation]] will come but slowly and only if you keep up with it.
Don't set an abstract goal or focus on the outcomes.
[[You can't control what happens]], so just focus on what you can control, your actions.
^[[[notes_How to achieve]]]

If this doesn't sound easy this is why a strong [[community]] or [[Sangha]] around you.
^[[[Communities are support systems]]]
A [[Sangha]] can prompt you to practice, help you learn the principles of [[meditation]] and help you through your struggles.

It may take you a while to perceive the effects of [[meditation]], but over time it will improve your life:
[[Meditation improves mental, physical, and emotional health]]
and it will shape your view of the world.
[[Karma is an open ended system of belief]]
