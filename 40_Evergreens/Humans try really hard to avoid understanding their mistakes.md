We answer to our urges first and our [[morality]] second
- answers [[What is the cognitive effect of living in an unjust world]]
- cause [[Humans are a product of evolution]]
- causes [[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]]
- causes [[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]]
- cause [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]]
- result [[We are confined to the tools of our time]]
- cause [[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]]

- counters [[Humans long to know what to do]]
