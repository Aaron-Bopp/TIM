#### [[Stereotyping has the psychological goal of comprehension and self-enhancement]] 

When we meet a new person or interact with a new situation, we fill in assumed information as a part of the process of learning about them. This is a normal process, [^1] but overreliance on it can lead to negative stereotyping and [[judgement]]s. Stereotyping another groups behavior as worse than our own personal behavior or the behavior of someone we admire is a form of self-enhancement. [^2]  This behavior leads to harm*less* distinctions and harm*ful* beliefs:
[[Stereotypes are beliefs, prejudices are feelings, and discrimination is treatment towards a group a member of group]]

[^1]: [[Humans love to group eachother]]
