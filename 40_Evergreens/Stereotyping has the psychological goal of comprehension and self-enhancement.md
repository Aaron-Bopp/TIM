#### [[Stereotyping has the psychological goal of comprehension and self-enhancement]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

When meet a new person or interact with a new situation, we fill in assumed information as a part of the process of learning about them. This is a normal process, [^1] but overreliance on it can lead to negative stereotyping and making the person feel [[judgement|judged]]. Stereotyping another groups behavior as worse than our own personal behavior or the behavior of someone we admire is a form of self-enhancement. [^2]  This behavior leads to harm*less* distinctions and harm*ful* beliefs:
[[Stereotypes are beliefs, prejudices are feelings, and discrimination is treatment towards a group a member of group]]

[^1]: [[Humans love to group eachother]]
[^2]: [[textbook_Hyde&Elsequest_pyschology of women and gender#Chapter 3]]

[[Stereotypes are social constructs]], but they have real effects, e.g. [[stereotype threat]], [[Insecure material conditions increase cognitive load and reduce outcomes]]
