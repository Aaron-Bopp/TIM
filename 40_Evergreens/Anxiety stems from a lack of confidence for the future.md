#### [[Anxiety stems from a lack of confidence for the future]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This is how:: [[Anxiety prevents us from living in the present]]
and why:: [[Confidence is a feedback loop]]

#TO/TEND/GRAFT 
- [[Your anxiety is telling you everything that could go wrong, not what will go wrong]]
- [[A secure identity is the best defense against social anxiety]]

Inversely:: [[Confidence comes when you are more capable of handling diverse outcomes]]

[[Existential dread]] can be seen as a long term [[group selection]] enforced trait.
