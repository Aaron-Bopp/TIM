#### [[Anxiety stems from a lack of confidence for the future]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

We know two things about our brains,
[[Confidence comes when you are more capable of handling diverse outcomes]] and [[Your anxiety is telling you everything that could go wrong, not what will go wrong]].
You can see how this could be a problem when you have the second and not the first. 
You don't have [[confidence]] that you will be able to handle *anything* going wrong and yet your [[anxiety]] is telling you that **everything** that could go wrong

This is 
how:: [[Anxiety prevents us from living in the present]]
and 
why:: [[Confidence is a feedback loop]]

With this is mind it is easy to see 
why:: [[A secure identity is the best defense against social anxiety]].
If you have a secure [[identity]] it means you understand who you are and how you want people to view you. Even if you don't have confidence in your ability to handle bad [[human behavior|social interaction]], you at least know that it isn't going to be detrimental to your [[self-image]].
