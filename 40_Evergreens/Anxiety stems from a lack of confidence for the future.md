#### [[Anxiety stems from a lack of confidence for the future]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This is 
how:: [[Anxiety prevents us from living in the present]]
and 
why:: [[Confidence is a feedback loop]]

#TO/TEND/GRAFT 
- [[Your anxiety is telling you everything that could go wrong, not what will go wrong]]
- [[A secure identity is the best defense against social anxiety]]

Inversely:: [[Confidence comes when you are more capable of handling diverse outcomes]]

[[Anxiety is a defense-mechanism of the brain]], and because [[Humans are a product of evolution]] that means it is [[adaptation|adaptive]].
This means [[Existential dread]] can be seen as a long term [[group selection]] enforced trait.
