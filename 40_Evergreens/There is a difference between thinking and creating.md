#### [[There is a difference between thinking and creating|What is the difference between thinking and creating]] 

Many task requires thought, remembering how you did something before, understanding the limitations and requirements of the task at hand, even just figuring out what you want to do, but creating is much more than that. It is the thinking that produces something new into this world.

We can see this difference demonstrated by [[Steal like an artist]]. There is a difference in the idea of intellectual property in the sciences vs the arts. Science is governed by citation, but music regularly riffs, remixes and covers. This is a a result of the culminating nature of [[science]] and our knowledge of the world. We would be nothing without the shoulders we stand on, the least we can do is cite them. Art on the other hand has the ability to change and altar art in a completely different way, but also at times cannot be recreated. There are many artists that paint more technically than Van Gogh, but there is a character to his art that impossible to recreate. 

Of course this is complicated by [[capitalism]] and copyright, and we have seen this influence art in recent years. #TO/DO/FIND example
At it's core though, art is detached from the things that influenced it, partially be the fact that the most important part of art is the observation of it: [[The audience's perception is more important than the artist's intention]] ^oieshi
