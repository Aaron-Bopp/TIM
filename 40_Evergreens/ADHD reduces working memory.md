#### [[ADHD reduces working memory]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

It is sometimes said that people with [[ADHD]] would have been hunter's 2000 years ago. [[Our brains are built around survival]] and our ability to [[hyperfocus]] and our ability to take in large amounts of sensory data at once [^1] makes this the most true for people with ADHD: [[Neurodiverse people can use their brain to their advantage]]

- [[ADHD is not a lack of attention it is a misplacement of attention]]
- [[ADHD is primarily an executive function disorder]]
