#### [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

When you are feeling [[anxiety]] it can often be very difficult to understand where the [[anxiety]] is coming from. In some situations it can be obvious (skydiving, flying, having a child, buying a house) while at other times it may seem obvious but be very nuanced, and at others it can be almost impossible to discover the source of the [[anxiety]].

As you are trying to deal with your [[anxiety]] you may start removing many perceived sources of [[anxiety]] to no [[success]]. This is because the perceived causes of the anxiety are actually just manifestations of a deeper insecurity. 

This is by design because your mind is [[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things|finding explanations for an inexplainable thing]], and your anxiety is just a [[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions| rationalization]] of these [[Complex emotions are intellectual understandings of primal urges|deeper emotions]]: [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]] 

Discovering what deeper mechanism is behind your anxiety can be difficult task, for many it takes years of [[self-actualization|introspection]]. 
 
 ##### Cause:: [[repressed]] identity
 
%%
#TO/TEND/REFACTOR these notes [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do#Cause repressed identity]], [[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]]

 #TO/TEND/DEOBFUSCATE [[A repressed self creates a mistrust of self-love and self-esteem]] and this section
 
 #TO/TEND/CONNECT [[A secure identity is the best defense against social anxiety]]
%%
 
If your [[identity]] is severely repressed, you will interacting with the world with a massive blind spot because you will be feeling things without understanding them: [[Identity is your understanding of yourself vs your interaction with the world]]. This generates [[anxiety]] because you do not understand the sources of the feelings well enough to predict when and understand why they happen. [[Most anxiety isn't irrational it's just overcompensation]], and in this case your anxiety will push you to go over every possibility, because your brain doesn't know which things to prioritize because the [[ego]] is blocking those things off: [[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]]

This naturally leads to an [[identity]] can lead to a variety of problems,
including struggling to understand where your [[emotions]] are coming from and why.
^[[[Overly interrogative parents can lead to alexithymic children]]]
If you don't understand who you are, you will struggle to understand why certain things make you feel good and certain things make you feel bad.
This leads to [[social anxiety]] as you will be spending so much time trying to figure out *why* you're feeling so anxious that you won't be able to live in the moment
^[[[Anxiety prevents us from living in the present]]]
The reason you can't pinpoint your [[anxiety]] is that
[[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]]
and [[Our brain actively inhibits us from processing repressed emotions]]

For example, because [[Trans children will repress their dysphoria if they have been effectively taught it is unacceptable]] [[transgender|trans]] children will often have lots of untraceable anxiety. This could also be related to people who are mentally handicapped often having very deep [[anxiety]] because they do not have the ability to understand situations and thus aren't able to find the source of the situation and [[anxiety]]. 

##### Cause:: material insecurity

Material insecurity can create this sensation: [[Insecure material conditions increase cognitive load and reduce outcomes]]. In recent years this has taken the form of [[existential dread]] as [[climate change]] looms and billionaires grow ever richer, people fathom the peril we are in. This leads to increasing levels of [[anxiety]] and [[depression]] as people try to grapple with this uncurbable anxiety: [[What is the cognitive effect of living in an unjust world|What is the cognitive effect of living in a unjust world?]]
