#### [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

When you are feeling [[anxiety]] it can often be very difficult to understand where the [[anxiety]] is coming from. In some situations it can be obvious (skydiving, flying, having a child, buying a house) while at other times it may seem obvious but be very nuanced, and it may feel impossible to discover the source of the [[anxiety]].

To deal with your [[anxiety]] you will start removing many perceived sources of [[anxiety]] to no [[success]]. This is because the perceived causes of the anxiety are actually just manifestations of a deeper insecurity. Removing them does not attack the true source of the [[anxiety]].

The reason behind this are complex, but we know that [[Anxiety is a defense-mechanism of the brain]], so there must be some reason that our brain is hiding these sources of anxiety from us.

The answer lies in
[[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]], and
[[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]].
These are both powerful ways that the [[mind]] can create a barrier of [[rationalizations|rationalization]] and [[emotions]] to prevent us from looking at things objectively, 
including the reasons for these emotions.
The actual sources of these [[defense-mechanisms]] are usually the hardest to discover
and for many it takes years of [[self-actualization|introspection]], [[therapy]], and sometimes a moment of realization.
 
 ##### Cause:: [[repressed]] [[identity]]
 


 [[Identity is your understanding of yourself vs your interaction with the world]], and so it is something that is very malleable during your formative years. 
 Additionally, [[Children make wide assumptions about the world]],
 so any rebuff of a forming identity can cause massive damage.
This means that our early [[childhood]] is the perfect storm for a core part of your [[identity]] like your sexuality or [[gender]] to become completely repressed.

If your [[identity]] is severely repressed, you will be interacting with the world with a massive blind spot 
%% #TO/TEND/PRUNE %% as you will be feeling things without understanding the source of them.
This can be a massive source of [[anxiety]] because you do not understand the sources of the feelings well enough to predict when and understand why they come up.
[[Your anxiety is telling you everything that could go wrong, not what will go wrong]],
and in this case your anxiety will push you to go over every possibility, 
because your [[conscious]] [[mind]] doesn't know which things to prioritize.

%% #TO/TEND/MULCH 
This naturally leads to a variety of problems,
including struggling to understand where your [[emotions]] are coming from and why.
^[[[Overly interrogative parents can lead to alexithymic children]]]
If you don't understand who you are, you will struggle to understand why certain things make you feel good and certain things make you feel bad.
This leads to [[social anxiety]] as you will be spending so much time trying to figure out *why* you're feeling so anxious that you won't be able to live in the moment
^[[[Anxiety prevents us from living in the present]]]
The reason you can't pinpoint your [[anxiety]] is that
[[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]]
and [[Our brain actively inhibits us from processing repressed emotions]]
%%

For example, because [[Trans children will repress their dysphoria if they have been effectively taught it is unacceptable]] [[transgender|trans]] children will often have lots of untraceable anxiety. 

##### Cause:: false view of reality

#TO/PONDER/IDEA below
This is similar to a repressed [[identity]], but plays less with a misunderstanding of [[self-image]] and more with a misunderstanding of [[self-perception]].
This can be seen with young women who have been told that have to look a certain way or act a certain way.
Much of [[trauma]] comes form this kind of gaslighting in [[childhood]]

##### Cause:: material insecurity

Material insecurity can create this sensation: [[Insecure material conditions increase cognitive load and reduce outcomes]]. In recent years this has taken the form of [[existential dread]] as [[climate change]] looms and billionaires grow ever richer, people fathom the peril we are in. This leads to increasing levels of [[anxiety]] and [[depression]] as people try to grapple with this uncurbable anxiety: [[What is the cognitive effect of living in an unjust world|What is the cognitive effect of living in a unjust world?]]

%%
#TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH is there a threshold where so many of you [[Hierarchy of needs]] are met that you have no choice but to fall into [[existential dread]]
- [[video_Existential Dread]]
%%

##### Cause:: [[mental illness]]

An interesting example of this is people who are extremely mentally handicapped or mentally impaired. As they can feel all of this at once.
#TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH Mental handicaps affect on [[anxiety]]. 
- [[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]]

##### What comes from this trait?
- [[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]]
- [[A repressed self creates a mistrust of self-love and self-esteem]]
- [[A secure identity is the best defense against social anxiety]]
