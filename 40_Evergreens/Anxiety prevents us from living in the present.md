#### [[Anxiety prevents us from living in the present]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

#TO/TEND/MULCH [[Anxiety]] is the future focused [[mind]]. 
This creates a [[feedback loop]] that pushes us to do anything but live in the present.
There are four ways that anxiety does this
^[[[notes_Responses to Anxiety]]]
1. Distraction - this is pure escapism and is quite effective, but the [[anxiety]] is waiting for you as soon as you runout of distraction
2. Avoidance - another way of escape, but one with much realer consequences
3. Reassurance - this while momentarily helpful, eventually leads to dependence, especially because [[Anxiety forces us to assume the worst]]
4. Just push through - this sometimes works because [[Most anxiety isn't irrational it's just overcompensation]], but other times this will just prevent you from attacking the root of the problem: [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]]

#TO/TEND/GRAFT 
- [[Anxiety forces us to assume the worst]]
- [[Meditation is a practice to gain control over your thoughts]]
- [[Living in the present moment is valuable]]
