#### [[Gas stoves suck]] 

From [[climate change]] activists to professional chefs,
the opinion that gas stoves suck is becoming more and more common.
The main claims behind this argument are:
- Induction stoves perform just as well as gas stoves
- Gas stoves reduce home air quality
- Having a gas stove in your home makes you more likely to keep a gas furnace
