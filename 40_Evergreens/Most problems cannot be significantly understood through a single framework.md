[[Neuroscience]] is the study of how behavior is produced, but it cannot answer [[The three main questions of life]].
Most of the problems in modern society cannot be understood, let alone solved by any one thing alone,
and yet
[[Experts are often far too confident in the effectiveness of their theories]].
