#### [[Greater cooperation and communication has lead to the success of humans as a species]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

> Ever since the [[Cognitive Revolution]] [[Homo sapiens]] has been able to revise its [[behavior]] rapidly in accordance with changing needs. This opened a fast lane of [[cultural evolution]], bypassing the traffic jams of genetic [[evolution]]. Speeding down this fast lane, [[Homo sapiens]] soon far outstripped all other human and animal species in its ability to cooperate.

[[Cultural evolution is not confined to the slow process of genetic evolution]], partially because 
cooperation and communication are the cornerstones of [[group selection]] and [[reciprocal altruism]].
[[Humans are a product of evolution]] so
by tracing back to the very beginning of [[human evolution]] 
we can see that they are what allowed [[homo sapiens]] 
to slowly overtake and outcompete every of other species of human. 

In [[books_Sapiens|Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari]], this take over by [[homo sapiens]] is termed the [[Cognitive Revolution]] where our increased ability for cooperation, [[language]], and thought allowed us to outcompete our contemporary humans.

Our increased cognitive abilities allowed us to create an [[imagined reality]] that allowed us to cooperate and adapt at a faster rate.
^[[[books_Sapiens#294248541q]]]
This was the very beginning of our [[social order]] that would evolve for the next 300,000 years.

This may seem inconsequential to modern day humans, but the very same biological mechanisms that allowed us to overtake prehistoric humans are still effecting us today,
^[[[Our biology has not significantly changed for thousands of years]]]
and in many ways the [[Cultural Evolution]] that has changed us so deeply in the past 2000 years is just a extension of the [[Cognitive Revolution]] that lead us to leave eastern Africa.

While, [[Evolutionary Psychology is just a framework not a prescription of behavior]] 
we can use our understanding of ancient humans to provide context to modern behaviors
like [[Humans love to group eachother]].
