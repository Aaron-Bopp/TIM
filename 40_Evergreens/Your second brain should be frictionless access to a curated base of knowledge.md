#### [[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

> [!summary]
> Your priorities for collecting thought in your [[second brain]] should be: 
> 1. The relation between your thoughts and other peoples thoughts
> 2. The organization of your thoughts and others thoughts
> 3. The accessibility of these thoughts

#TO/WRITE how do we reduce the [[friction]] of gathering information (and how this can lead to the collector's fallacy) and then how do we curate the information so that we can learn from it. Emphasize that the ultimate goes is to reduce [[friction]] because [[Friction is a hindrance to learning]] 
%%

Many a [[knowledge management|PKM]] guru has warned against [[The Collector's Fallacy]], of collecting more thought than you can use. I think this is very wise advice for new users who may not know what the purpose of the knowledge management system is or how to store information in it valuably, but if collection allows for more frictionless access to knowledge then it can be ignored. 
^[[[Better tools allow us to be less disciplined and more productive]]]

There is a difference between collecting something because it is __useful__ and collecting something __to use it.__ As you refine your [[knowledge management|knowledge management system]] you will find what are the hard rules and what are the soft rules around what should be collected into your vault: [[The more mistakes you've fixed the more bad decisions you can afford]].

Without the knowledge of [[The fragility of nodes in a second brain|which notes introduce fragility]] into your [[second brain]], you can easily become overwhelmed. Here are some guidelines to collect thought without generating [[friction]]:
- [[Curate source notes and definitions in your second brain to avoid junk text]]
- [[Separate stub notes from the rest of your vault so you don't get overwhelmed]]. 
- [[Prioritize organization over categorization]]
- [[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]]
- [[Densely linked webs of thought provide intuitive access to knowledge]]

Some of this curation can be offloaded to [[AI]]: [[A totally integrated machine should automate as much of the thinking process as possible]]
