#### [[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

```ad-summary
Your priorities for collecting thought in your [[second brain]] should be: 
1. The relation between your thoughts and other peoples thoughts
2. The organization of your thoughts and others thoughts
3. The accessibility of these thoughts
```

Many a [[knowledge management|PKM]] guru has warned against "collecting thought vs creating thought" or said "don't make your vault a second wikipedia" which I think is very wise advice for people who do not have reason to process their collections. *There is a difference between collecting something because it is __useful__ and collecting something __to use it.__*

As you refine your [[knowledge management|knowledge management system]] you will find what are the hard rules and what are the soft rules around what should be collected into your vault: [[The more mistakes you've fixed the more bad decisions you can afford]].

Without the knowledge of [[The fragility of nodes in a second brain|which notes introduce fragility]] into your [[second brain]], you can easly become overwhelmed. Here are some guidelines to collect thought without generating friction:
- [[Curate source notes and definitions in your second brain to avoid junk text]]
- [[Separate stub notes from the rest of your vault so you don't get overwhelmed]]. 
- [[Prioritize organization over categorization to avoid wasted energy]]
- [[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]]
- [[Webs of thought are densely linked]]
