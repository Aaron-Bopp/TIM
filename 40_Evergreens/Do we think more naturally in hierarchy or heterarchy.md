#### [[Do we think more naturally in hierarchy or heterarchy]]

At first thought I think we think no because neurons don't have an up connection and down connection
but in society we definitely gravitate towards some kind of [[hierarchy]].
[[We naturally define relationships between ideas]] but relationships don't have to be hierarchical.
Even if we do think in [[hierarchy]] it definitely isn't static.
Can we hold multiple different items as children of the same item?

This is
important for:: [[What is the cognitive origin of social hierarchy]].
Even though this is much more applicable to [[knowledge management]], understanding the fundamental theory behind our mind's aptitude can help explain how and why [[social hierarchy]] came about.
We can also draw inspiration from anthropological understandings of [[social hierarchy]].
Gravitation towards hierarchy is not universal, and we have observed many [[egalitarian]] societies, but
[[Once hierarchy is in place vested interests will keep it in place]].
It seems that once we start thinking in hierarchies it is much easier to continue thinking in them than to not.
