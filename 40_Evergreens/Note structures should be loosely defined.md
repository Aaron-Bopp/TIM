#### [[Note structures should be loosely defined]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

#TO/TEND/PRUNE this note is kindoff the ancestor of [[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge]], [[Your second brain should be an inspirational hub of creativity]], [[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]]

As you're writing notes your structure shouldn't be constricting your thought it should be encouraging it. If a structure makes you stop and think, "I have no idea what to put in here" it is interrupting the process of creation, but if it stops and makes you think, "here are all the things I can put in here" It is adding to your process. IF the borders of your structures are loosely defined it will make it easier to use them. While some would say that loosely defined structures will just lead to unorganized thought, this trade off is either warranted or completely avoided by the creation of the structures.

Examples:
[[my TO(DO) and EVER(GREEN) structure]] is grouping of tags that I update on every note in [[My TIM]]. These tags have loosely defined meanings, in that there is no exact definition of what a ever/seed is vs an ever/sprout, and often I will find notes and think that they much more deserve to be in a different category. But that process is expected and is part of maintaining [[evergreen notes]]. I know that I will be going through and constantly adding to, refining, and changing notes and thus changing their status tag, so if a note is mistagged, it will get seen again no matter what.

I have a **Topics** section in all of my [[evergreen notes]], who's [[purpose]] is clear: prompt me to add links without the pressure of including them in the note body. It makes it much easier to approach these areas because I know that really anything that go in them and that those things will most likely be helpful.
