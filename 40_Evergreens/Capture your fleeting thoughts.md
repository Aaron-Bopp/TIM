#### [[Capture your fleeting thoughts]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

A fleeting note is one that is taken at spur of the moment speed. You may not have time to do that work that is required for a [[evergreen notes]], but you should have enough time to categorize your note as a fleeting note so that you can easily find it later on and either discard it or organize it into a [[evergreen notes]]
The way that I accomplish this in my system is using the [[my TO(DO) and EVER(GREEN) structure]] and the [[QUICKNOTE]]

#TO/TEND/CONCEPTUALIZE how you are currently doing this
