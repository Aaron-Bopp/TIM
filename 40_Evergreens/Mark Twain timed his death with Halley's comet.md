#### [[Mark Twain timed his death with Halley's comet]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

> The American writer [[Mark Twain]], for instance, was born as the [[comets|comet]] blazed above the Missouri sky. Seventy-four years later, he wrote, “I came in with Halley’s Comet in 1835. It is coming again next year, and I expect to go out with it.” And he did, dying in 1910 as Halley reappeared. Twain had a hell of a gift for narrative structure, especially when it came to memoir.
