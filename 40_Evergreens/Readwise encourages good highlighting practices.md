#### [[Readwise encourages good highlighting practices]]

part of:: [[How to use highlighting]]

See [[Readwise Export for Obsidian - Templates and Process]] for more details about what Readwise is.

The fact that you can export highlights to [[Readwise (software)|Readwise]] and that it pushes a daily review encourages two things:
- including context in highlights
- highlighting information you want to remember

[[Readwise (software)|Readwise]] also provides tools to making better extracted highlights, such as allowing you to create a heading structure and to combine highlights.
