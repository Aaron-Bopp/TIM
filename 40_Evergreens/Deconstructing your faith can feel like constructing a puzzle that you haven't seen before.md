#### [[Deconstructing your faith can feel like constructing a puzzle that you haven't seen before]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

> I feel I am a giant box of puzzle pieces, but the box is full of like 20 puzzles and I have to find the right pieces for the right puzzle, without knowing which puzzle is the right one.

My strategy was to tip over the box and choose the smallest puzzle: [[My Deconstruction journey#How has my worldview evolved since leaving the church]]

[[Non-faith issues have been co-opted to keep people in the Christian church]], which has heavily closed [[Christianity]] off to new ideas, and forced Christians to deal with many levels of logical fallacies. [[Evangelicalism]] pushes people to remain ignorant because [[The actual path to being a good person isn't explored by Evangelicalism]].


[[Deconstructing your faith is like climbing through a jungle canopy]]

This is kind of what it feels like to [[socialization|socialize]] as an [[Autism|autistic]] person. You are aware of all the different pieces that come in puzzles and that you are trying to make a puzzle, but you don't know what puzzle that is, and the [[neurotypical]] person you're talking to knows and won't tell you~
