#### [[Deconstructing your faith can feel like constructing a puzzle that you haven't seen before]] 

> I feel I am a giant box of puzzle pieces, but the box is full of like 20 puzzles and I have to find the right pieces for the right puzzle, without knowing which puzzle is the right one.

My strategy was to tip over the box and choose the smallest puzzle: [[My Deconstruction journey# How has my worldview evolved since leaving the church]]

This is a
result of:: [[Faith is an abstraction of cognitive dissonance]].
Christian's have been heavily closed off to new ideas, and haven't had to deal with the many inconsistencies of the faith,
because:: [[Non-faith issues have been co-opted to keep people in the Christian church]].

- part of:: [[Worldviews should not make life seem easy and simple]]
- Similarly:: [[Deconstructing your faith is like climbing through a jungle canopy]]

This is kind of what it feels like to [[socialization|socialize]] as an [[Autism|autistic]] person. You are aware of all the different pieces that come in puzzles and that you are trying to make a puzzle, but you don't know what puzzle that is, and the [[neurotypical]] person you're talking to knows and won't tell you.
