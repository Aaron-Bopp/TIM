#### [[Religious concepts are often too powerful for a child's mind]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Fear of hell is baked into Christianity for vulnerable believers]], if it is instilled from a young age that your eternal fate is at stake. %% #TO/TEND/WEED %%
^[[[Children will not question what is modeled for them unless they are taught to]]]
[[Christianity]] teaches that the feelings of an omnipotent god are more important than yours,
and you must submit yourself to this god in order to avoid hell.
[[Negative influences impact us more than positive influences]] and especially as children this will stick with us:
[[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]

[[Parents need to model the ability to deal with emotion to their children]],
but religious [[parents]] repeatedly teach their children that all of their problems can be solved in [[faith]].
Because Christians have always had such a simple and obvious choice to avoid this damnation, 
^[[[Worldviews should not make life seem easy and simple]]]
[[Christians struggle to feel empathy because they must believe that non-christians are going to hell]]

#TO/TEND/GRAFT 
- [[The brain is powerful enough to create supernatural experiences]]
- [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]]
- [[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]
- [[Children make wide assumptions about the world]]
- [[Parents need to model the ability to deal with emotion to their children]]
- [[Trans children will repress their dysphoria if they have been effectively taught it is unacceptable]]
- [[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things]]
- [[Worldviews should not make life seem easy and simple]]
