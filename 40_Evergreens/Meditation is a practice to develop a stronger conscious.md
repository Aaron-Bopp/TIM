#### [[Meditation is a practice to develop a stronger conscious]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Consciousness is our capacity to introspect]], but the [[diversity]] of our experiences means that the ways that [[meditation]] is practiced will differ from person to person:
[[How to develop a meditation practice]]

Different styles of [[meditation]] will help us find the best way for our [[consciousness]] to adapt.

#TO/TEND/PRUNE
[[Zen]] helps you develop [[consciousness]] by making you aware of the input from your [[Indriya]], but [[Trataka]] helps you strengthen your ability to focus on one thing and allow your [[subconscious]] to be closer to the world:
[[Meditation is a practice to gain control over your thoughts]]

If we calm the [[consciousness|conscious]] it will allow us to have closer connection to the [[subconscious]] which is why [[Meditation helps us detach negative attachments]].

The method behind this is a calming of the [[ANS|Autonomic Nervous System]]: [[Meditation helps us regulate our nervous system]]
but on a much more [[spirituality|spiritual]] level we are interacting with the building blocks 
^[[[Brahman]]]
of the [[universe]]:
[[Consciousness is the fundamental unit of existence]]
