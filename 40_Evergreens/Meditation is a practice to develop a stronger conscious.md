^[[[notes_Different Meditative Styles]]]

[[Zen]] helps you develop [[conscious|consciousness]] by making you aware of your [[Indriya]] but [[Trataka]] helps you strengthen your ability to focus on one thing and allow your [[subconscious]] to be closer to the world:
[[Meditation is a practice to develop a stronger conscious]]

If we calm the [[conscious]] it will allow us to have closer connection to the [[subconscious]] which is why [[Meditation helps us detach negative attachments]].

The method behind this is a calming of the [[ANS|Autonomic Nervous System]]: [[Meditation helps us regulate our nervous system]]
but on a much more [[spirituality|spiritual]] level we are interacting with the building blocks 
^[[[Brahman]]]
of the [[universe]]:
[[Consciousness is the fundamental unit of existence]]
