#### [[What maintains our social order]] 

What are the methods that keep our [[society]] from collapsing (or keep it in a state of perpetual collapse)?

#####  shared [[belief]]

If we believe [[Social order is built off of a shared belief in an imagined reality]] then we must believe that there is a connection between our shared [[belief]] and the maintenance of our [[material conditions]].
[[Yuval Noah Harari]] believes our belief in myths is this connection and that losing these beliefs would shake and change our [[social order]].
^[[[10_Sources/books - Sapiens#^297681744]]]
The problem is that even if we could change the mind of every person on the planet, it would not change the world we live in until we acted.
While the social order was built through shared imagination, it cannot be changed through imagination, it can only be changed through action.

##### [[social construct]]

[[Social constructs are material manifestations of shared belief]].
I would argue that once a [[Imagined reality]] has become a [[social construct]] it will have *non*-imagined (or material) effects on the world. Once this has happened, letting go of that [[belief]] will not affect that [[social construct]], we need to tear it down. ^5d2266

##### [[violence]]

Violence is likely not the answer, as the ability to organize humans to violently maintain the [[social order]], must itself be contained,
i.e. cynics don't build empires.

This is part of why [[There is no direct relation between physical strength and social power]] 

##### [[social control]]

This allows you to enforce the [[belief]] and the [[behavior]] in some sort of [[feedback loop]].
[[Yuval Noah Harari]] says that one key to maintaining a [[Imagined order]] is
to never admit the order is imaginary.
This is important in the way that hierarchies are maintained:

[[What is the origin of social hierarchy]]

[[David Sloan Wilson]] backs this up in his book [[10_Sources/books - Darwin's Cathedral|Darwin's Cathedral]], citing mutual vigilance and social control as the way we achieve [[social order]].
^[[[10_Sources/books - Darwin's Cathedral#^295490297]]]

This also makes this 
part of:: [[What is the origin of religion]]
as [[Religion promotes high social control]]

##### Why is it important to know this?

This
answers:: [[How do we effect change in society]]

works with:: [[Why is it hard to understand how our environment effects us]]
