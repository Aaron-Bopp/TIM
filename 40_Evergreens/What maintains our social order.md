#### [[What maintains our social order]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

from:: [[What is the cognitive origin of our social order]]

##### [[belief]]

If we believe that the foundation of our [[social order]] is an [[Imagined order]] based off our shared [[Imagined reality]], then we must believe that there is a connection between our shared [[belief]] and the maintenance of our [[material conditions]].
[[Yuval Noah Harari]] believes our belief in myths is this connection and that losing these beliefs would shake and change our [[social order]].
^[[[books_Sapiens#^297681744]]]
I would argue that once a [[Imagined reality]] has become a [[social construct]] it will have *non*-imagined (or material) effects on the world. Once this has happened, letting go of that [[belief]] will not affect that [[social construct]], we need to tear it down.

##### [[violence]]

Violence is likely not the answer, as the ability to organize humans to violently maintain the [[social order]], must itself be contained,
^[[[books_Sapiens#^297681745]]]
i.e. cynics don't build empires.
^[[[books_Sapiens#^297681746]]]

This is part of why [[There is no direct relation between physical strength and social power]] 

##### [[social control]]

This allows you to enforce the [[belief]] and the [[behavior]] in some sort of [[feedback loop]].
[[Yuval Noah Harari]] says that one key to maintaining a [[Imagined order]] is
to never admit the order is imaginary.
This is important in the way that hierarchies are maintained:
^[[[books_Sapiens#^299110301]]]
[[What is the origin of social hierarchy]]

[[David Sloan Wilson]] backs this up in his book [[books_Darwin's Cathedral|Darwin's Cathedral]], citing mutual vigilance and social control as the way we achieve [[social order]].
^[[[books_Darwin's Cathedral#^295490297]]]

This also makes this 
part of:: [[What is the origin of religion]]
as [[Religion promotes high social control]]

##### Why is it important to know this?

This
answers:: [[How do we effect change in society]]

works with:: [[Why is it hard to understand how social order effects us]]
