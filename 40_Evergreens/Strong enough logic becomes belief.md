Who?
- Scientists 
- [[Dr. K]]
 - dummies [[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]]
[[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]]

[[perception]] is reality, so your perception of logic is [[belief]]

This [[perception]] can be wrong, or your logic can be wrong

An incel's [[perception]] or reality is wrong, but their [[rationalizations]] based of those perceptions are wrong

Scientists [[perception]]
