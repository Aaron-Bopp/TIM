#### [[Strong enough logic becomes belief]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

#TO/PONDER/CONCEPT 
You can get so caught up in complex logic, that you can no longer see the full problem, and merely believe that your logic up to that point is true. 
%%
Who?
- Scientists 
- [[Dr. K]]
 - dummies [[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]]
[[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]]

[[perception]] is reality, so your perception of logic is [[belief]]

This [[perception]] can be wrong, or your logic can be wrong

An incel's [[perception]] of reality is wrong, but their [[rationalizations]] based of those perceptions are wrong

Scientists [[perception]]s can be wrong, but their logic makes up for it

Mathematicians do not rely on perception they only rely on logic

[[Humans are addicted to believing]]%%
