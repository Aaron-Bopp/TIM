#### [[Strong enough logic becomes belief]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Who?
- Scientists 
- [[Dr. K]]
 - dummies [[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]]
[[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]]

[[perception]] is reality, so your perception of logic is [[belief]]

This [[perception]] can be wrong, or your logic can be wrong

An incel's [[perception]] of reality is wrong, but their [[rationalizations]] based of those perceptions are wrong

Scientists [[perception]]s can be wrong, but their logic makes up for it

Mathematicians do not rely on perception they only rely on logic

[[Belief is an addiction]]
