#### [[How the patriarchy effects young men's understanding of masculinity]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`
#TO/TEND/REFACTOR title #TO/DO/WRITE/ANSWER 

> Those people who speak of masculinity as an essence, as an inborn characteristic, are confusing [[masculinity]] with [[masculinism]], the masculine ideology. Masculinism is the ideology that justifies and naturalizes male domination.

> For boys, then, the question is not whether to take on a typical male sex role, but rather how to position themselves according to the masculine discourses available to them.
