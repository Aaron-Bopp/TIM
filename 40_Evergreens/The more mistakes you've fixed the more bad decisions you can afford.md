#### [[The more mistakes you've fixed the more bad decisions you can afford]] 

![['Don't be the reason that rules exist' - Nathan Eloe#qoute]]

Gaining experience requires failure

##### Repeatedly failing and fixing it gives you the right to make bad decisions.

A bad decision for a beginner is not the same as a bad decision for an expert. A bad decision for an expert is one that takes away their time from the most meaningful tasks for less fruitful or fulfilling tasks: [[Powerful tools make dangerous toys]]

A bad decision for a beginner is one the will not teach them how to succeed or teach them to make more mistakes. 
^[[[Better tools allow us to be less disciplined and more productive]]]
A hard rule may be the more difficult path but will setup future [[success]]. Hard disciplines breed masters, easy disciplines attract wannabes.
