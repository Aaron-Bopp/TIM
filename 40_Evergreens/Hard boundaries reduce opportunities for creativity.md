#### [[Hard boundaries reduce opportunities for creativity]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This is 
part of:: [[Prioritize understanding over organization or categorization]] and [[Your second brain should be an inspirational hub of creativity]].
If you silo yourself into one line of thinking you will hurt your ability to accept new [[information]]. 

[[The way systems work can create cognitive bias]] but
[[Learning how systems work can be a gateway to creating thought]],
so you should [[Write your notes with a system not within a system]].

##### Counterpoint:: [[Good friction causes the brain to engage]] and the same is true for creativity

Working in constraints can help you grow and create new things.
[[There is a difference between thinking and creating]], but perhaps in this way they are similar.
