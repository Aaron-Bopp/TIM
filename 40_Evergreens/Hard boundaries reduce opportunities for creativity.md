part of:: [[Prioritize understanding over organization or categorization]].
If you silo yourself into one line of thinking you will hurt your ability to accept new [[information]].

We create a [[web of thought]] because [[Densely linked webs of thought provide intuitive access to knowledge]],
and we recognize [[The fragility of information in knowledge management]] so we can focus our [[understanding]].
