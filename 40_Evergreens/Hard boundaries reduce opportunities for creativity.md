#### [[Hard boundaries reduce opportunities for creativity]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

If you silo yourself into one line of thinking you will hurt your ability to accept new [[information]]. This is why we often find it easier to learn as children, and why [[childhood]] [[trauma]] can be so impactful: 
[[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]]

- [[Hard rules create cognitive bias]]
	- [[Only organize as much as your data requires]]
- [[Your second brain should be an inspirational hub of creativity]]
	- [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow# Counter Evergreen notes don't allow for new ideas]]
- [[Write your notes with a system not within a system]]
- [[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]]
