#### [[You need to teach yourself what you read]] 

This
answers:: [[How to understand what you read]],
in addition to:: [[You need to remember what you read]]

Just because you are reading does not mean you are understanding
and just because you are understanding does not mean you will remember.
If we want to truly learn from what we read, we need to be teaching it to ourselves.
A good guideline for this is
[[Blooms taxonomy]].
The best way I have found to do this is through [[evergreen notes]],
because
[[Evergreen notes help us bridge the gap between knowledge and understanding]].

%% #TO/TEND/MULCH 
Any insight that you can find original or not is vital to your understanding.
The main point is not just to rephrase the author,
although that is helpful,
the point also not to quiz yourself on what the author is telling you,
although that also can be helpful,
the point is to work with the material enough that you could teach it to someone else,
so first you need to teach it to yourself.

leads to:: [[You need to take what you read out of context]]
