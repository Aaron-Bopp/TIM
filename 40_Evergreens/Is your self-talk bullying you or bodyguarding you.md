#### [[Is your self-talk bullying you or bodyguarding you]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`
This is a practice exercise from [[books_You and Your Gender Identity|You and Your Gender Identity by Dara Hoffman-Fox]]

With enough practice, you'll be able to tell if your [[self]]-talk is coming from an Internal Bully or from your Bodyguard. The key is to ask yourself: 
- Which words are being used in my [[self]]-talk? 
- What is the tone and intention of my [[self]]-talk?

Self-talk is a manifestation of your [[self-image]], and like your [[self-image]] can be accurate or inaccurate. 
#TO/TEND/GRAFT 
- [[Self-hatred is born out of dissonance between self-image and self-perception]]
