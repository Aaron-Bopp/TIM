#### [[Is your self-talk bullying you or bodyguarding you]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`
This is a practice exercise from [[books_You and Your Gender Identity|You and Your Gender Identity by Dara Hoffman-Fox]]

With enough practice, you'll be able to tell if your [[self]]-talk is coming from an Internal Bully or from your Bodyguard. The key is to ask yourself: 
- Which words are being used in my [[self]]-talk? 
- What is the tone and intention of my [[self]]-talk?
