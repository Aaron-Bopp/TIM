#### [[Is your self-talk bullying you or bodyguarding you]] 
This is a practice exercise from [[books - You and Your Gender Identity|You and Your Gender Identity by Dara Hoffman-Fox]]

> With enough practice, you'll be able to tell if your [[self]]-talk is coming from an Internal Bully or from your Bodyguard. The key is to ask yourself: 
> - Which words are being used in my [[self]]-talk? 
> - What is the tone and intention of my [[self]]-talk?

Self-talk is a manifestation of your [[self-image]], and like your [[self-image]] can be accurate or inaccurate. 
For more on how your [[mind]] can lie to you:
- [[Self-hatred is born out of dissonance between self-image and self-perception]]
- [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]]
- [[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]]

Negative self-talk can 
lead to:: [[Confidence is a feedback loop]]
