#### [[Our authority figures curate and reinforce what we are allowed to imitate]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

In [[Social Learning Theory]], imitation is one of four key mechanism for social learning. This means that children are more likely to imitate the actions of authority figures, most often [[parents]]: [[Parents need to model the ability to deal with emotion to their children]]

This leads to so many elements of modern society such as [[gender roles]], [[racism]], and [[inter-generational trauma]]. Primarily because [[Parents need to model the ability to deal with emotion to their children]].

This fact is true in both synchronous interactions like fear responses and [[self-soothing]], but also in asynchronous responses like in [[Gender self-socialization model]]. This means that children may see an action and then not reproduce for months or years later. [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]], when behaviors become engrained in our pyschy, we will rarely question them. [^1]

[^1]: [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]]

- [[Children will not question what is modeled for them unless they are taught to]]
- [[How can parent's best help their children]]
- [[Humans long to know what to do]]
