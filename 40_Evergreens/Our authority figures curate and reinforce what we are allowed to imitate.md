#### [[Our authority figures curate and reinforce what we are allowed to imitate]] 

In [[Social Learning Theory]], imitation is one of four key mechanism for social [[learning]], 
and children are more likely to imitate the actions of the people they are most often in contact with, and later on the people who they trust the most.
Our parents have so much power over how we turn out, whether they realize it or not.

This leads to so many elements of modern [[society]], such as [[gender roles]] and [[inter-generational trauma]],
and can lead to prejudiced beliefs being passed on.

This is true in both synchronous interactions like [[fear]] responses and [[self-soothing]], but also in asynchronous responses like in the [[Gender self-socialization model]]. 

[[Humans long to know what to do]], when behaviors become engrained in our psyche, we will rarely question them:
[[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]

- From:: [[Parents need to model the ability to deal with emotion to their children]]
- made worse by:: [[Children will not question what is modeled for them unless they are taught to]]
- important for:: [[How can parent's best help their children]]
