#### [[Our authority figures curate and reinforce what we are allowed to imitate]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

From:: [[Parents need to model the ability to deal with emotion to their children]]

In [[Social Learning Theory]], imitation is one of four key mechanism for social [[learning]], 
and children are more likely to imitate the actions of authority figures, most often [[parents]].
%%Why? #TO/PONDER/IDEA %%

This leads to so many elements of modern society such as [[gender roles]], [[racism]], and [[inter-generational trauma]]. This is
made worse by:: [[Children will not question what is modeled for them unless they are taught to]]

This is true in both synchronous interactions like [[fear]] responses and [[self-soothing]], but also in asynchronous responses like in the [[Gender self-socialization model]]. 

[[Humans long to know what to do]], when behaviors become engrained in our psyche, we will rarely question them:
[[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]

This is important
for:: [[How can parent's best help their children]]
