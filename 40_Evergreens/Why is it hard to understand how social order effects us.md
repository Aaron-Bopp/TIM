#### [[Why is it hard to understand how social order effects us]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

> ![[books_Sapiens#^297681749]]

Why can't we realize that we live in an [[imagined order]]?

This is a question posed in [[reference_Sapiens|Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari]], that closely 
ties into:: [[What is the cognitive origin of our social order]]
![[reference_Sapiens#^dd0325]]
[[inter-subjective]]

Other possible reasons:
- We are indoctrinated
- We can't objectively observe what we are a part of
- We want to believe ^[[[books_Sapiens#^297681750]]]
- We are materially affected by this [[social order]]
- We want to change this [[social order]]?
- The fact that it is imagined doesn't change anything about it

I think that in modern times we have for the most part realized that we live in a [[Imagined order]] except perhaps for christians? It seems like this question is a lot more meaningful when contrasted with the long held belief in a "natural law" or natural order. These days we have mainly come to the conclusion that our [[social order]] is imagined, but we are still trying to figure out 

I do think that we struggle to understand how [[society]] effects us
