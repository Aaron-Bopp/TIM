#### [[Once hierarchy is in place vested interests will keep it in place]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

part of:: [[What is the origin of social hierarchy]]

Usually, no one person has the power to put change or put hierarchy into the current [[social order]],
but in times of [[war]] and great social upheaval 
some sort of hierarchy is usually put into place.
Once that hierarchy is in place,
it will be much harder to remove.
Over time people will start to benefit more and more from the hierarchy and eventually they will start working against any effort to remove it.
