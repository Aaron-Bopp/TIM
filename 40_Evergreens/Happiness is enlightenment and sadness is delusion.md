#### [[Happiness is enlightenment and sadness is delusion]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Bhuddism]] states that the cause of suffering is [[ignorance]] and [[desire]] because you are not seeing the world as it actually is and wanting things that do not exist, but it also states that truth of suffering is that it exists;it has a cause; it has an end; and it has a cause to bring about its end. [^1]  The purpose of life is the pursuit of bliss, and it is delusion to avoid it.

This is true [[optimism]]. [[True optimism is acknowledging the suffering of the world and defying it anyway|acknowledging the suffering of the world and defying it anyway]]. Even people who have fallen into [[pessimism]]  [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness|must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]]. This is no easy task, so [[Bhuddism outlines a path and practice to end suffering, but does not promise it]] rather than making it [[Worldviews are wrong if they make life seem easy and simple| seem easy ]] and leading people into [[cognitive dissonance]].

#TO/TEND/CONCEPTUALIZE the contrast here[[Sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion]] and here [[Bhuddism is the study of happiness through detachment|The nature of happiness is not doing what you love its detachment from the decisions of the life]].
