#### [[Happiness is enlightenment and sadness is delusion]] 

[[Buddhism]] states that the cause of [[suffering]] is [[ignorance]] (not seeing the world as it actually is) and [[desire]] (wanting things that do not exist), but it also states that truth of suffering is that it exists; it has a cause; it has an end; and it has a cause to bring about its end. [^1]  The purpose of life is the pursuit of bliss, and it is delusion to avoid it.

This is “true [[optimism]]“: [[True optimism is acknowledging the suffering of the world and defying it anyway|acknowledging the suffering of the world and defying it anyway]]. Even people who have fallen into [[pessimism]]  [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness|must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]]. 

This is no easy task, so [[Buddhism outlines a path and practice to end suffering, but does not promise it]] rather than making it [[Worldviews should not make life seem easy and simple| seem easy ]] and leading people into [[cognitive dissonance]].

#TO/PONDER/IDEA what is the difference between [[contentment]] and [[happiness]]? 
the contrast here[[Sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion]] and here [[Buddhism is the study of happiness through detachment|The nature of happiness is not doing what you love its detachment from the decisions of the life]].

#TO/PONDER/RELATIONSHIP
- [[Purpose is derived from within, duty is derived from without]]
- [[Right kinds of thoughts lead to right kinds of actions]]

 
> too many people are living their lives with dead eyes, as an ordeal, an obligation
what the world "needs" is people who have come alive, who are joyful, who love living
everything else is downstream of that
