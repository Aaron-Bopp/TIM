#### [[Happiness is enlightenment and sadness is delusion]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Buddhism]] states that the cause of suffering is [[ignorance]] (not seeing the world as it actually is) and [[desire]] (wanting things that do not exist), but it also states that truth of suffering is that it exists; it has a cause; it has an end; and it has a cause to bring about its end. [^1]  The purpose of life is the pursuit of bliss, and it is delusion to avoid it.

This is “true [[optimism]]“: [[True optimism is acknowledging the suffering of the world and defying it anyway|acknowledging the suffering of the world and defying it anyway]]. Even people who have fallen into [[pessimism]]  [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness|must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]]. 

This is no easy task, so [[Buddhism outlines a path and practice to end suffering, but does not promise it]] rather than making it [[Worldviews should not make life seem easy and simple| seem easy ]] and leading people into [[cognitive dissonance]].

#TO/TEND/CONCEPTUALIZE the contrast here[[Sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion]] and here [[Buddhism is the study of happiness through detachment|The nature of happiness is not doing what you love its detachment from the decisions of the life]].
