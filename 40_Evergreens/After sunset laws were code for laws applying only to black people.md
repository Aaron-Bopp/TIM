#### [[After sunset laws were code for laws applying only to black people]]

These sunset laws were variants of [[black codes]],
which would take simple things like carrying a razer in your pocket (carrying a concealed weapon), walking down a railroad track (trespassing), and quitting your job (breaking a labor contract).
