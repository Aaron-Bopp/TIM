#### [[Anxiety should be a tool at your disposal not an impedance to your life]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Being paralyzed by your [[anxiety]] is not your brain's desired outcome, [[Our brains are built around survival]] and [[Social anxiety isn't irrational it's just overcompensation| our anxiety is just overcompensation]].
This does not mean our [[anxiety]] is any less impactful in our lives, but with the proper support structure and practices like [[mindfulness]] and [[meditation]] we can limit the debilitating effects of anxiety and focus on the things our brain is trying to warn us of: [[You're not afraid of falling off the cliff you're afraid of jumping off the cliff]]

[[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]] and [[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]]. Your anxiety is telling you to be wary of something, and sometimes that threat is something that we are not [[conscious|consciously]] aware of: [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]]

see:: [[Neurodiverse people can use their brain to their advantage]]
