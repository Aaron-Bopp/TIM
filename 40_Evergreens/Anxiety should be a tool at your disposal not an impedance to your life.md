#### [[Anxiety should be a tool at your disposal not an impedance to your life]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Being paralyzed by your [[anxiety]] is not your brain's desired outcome.
[[Our brains are built around survival]],
if anything, anxiety's purpose is to warn you of danger so you CAN act, not so that you are unable to act.
This does not mean our [[anxiety]] is any less impactful in our lives,
[[Most anxiety isn't irrational it's just overcompensation]],
but [[Anxiety is a defense-mechanism of the brain]] and sometimes that means that means our [[anxiety]] has more say over our life than we want it to:
[[Anxiety prevents us from living in the present]]

With the proper support structure and practices like [[mindfulness]] and [[meditation]] we can limit the debilitating effects of anxiety and focus on the things our brain is trying to warn us of: [[You're not afraid of falling off the cliff you're afraid of jumping off the cliff]]

In some ways our [[anxiety]] is already working for us, 
if we know how to understand it.
[[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]],
and if your anxiety is being consistently triggered by something that is worth looking into.
[[Triggers are stored interactions that lead to strong emotional responses]],
and
[[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]].
That [[anxiety]] might be aware of something that [[conscious]] you is not.

At the end of the day, the same [[feedback loop]] that fuels [[anxiety]] can be used to fuel [[confidence]]:
[[Confidence is a feedback loop]]

similarly:: [[Neurodiverse people can use their brain to their advantage]]
