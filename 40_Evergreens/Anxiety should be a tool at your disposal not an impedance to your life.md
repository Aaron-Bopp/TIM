#### [[Anxiety should be a tool at your disposal not an impedance to your life]] 

Being paralyzed by your [[anxiety]] is not your brain's desired outcome.
[[The ultimate goal of the mind is to keep thinking]],
if anything, anxiety's purpose is to warn you of danger so you CAN act, not so that you are unable to act.
This does not mean our [[anxiety]] is any less impactful in our lives,
[[Your anxiety is telling you everything that could go wrong, not what will go wrong]],
and sometimes that means our [[anxiety]] has more say over our life than we want it to.
^[[[Anxiety prevents us from living in the present]]
and [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]] are two examples]

[[Anxiety is a defense-mechanism of the brain]].
With the proper support structure and practices like [[mindfulness]] and [[meditation]] we can limit the debilitating effects of anxiety and focus on the things our brain is trying to warn us of. 
^[To better understand these warning systems, take a look at [[Our brains are built around survival]] and [[You don't want to jump off the cliff you're just afraid of falling]]]

In some ways our [[anxiety]] is already working for us, 
if we know how to understand it.
[[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]],
and if your anxiety is being consistently triggered by something that is worth looking into.
[[Triggers activate stored emotional responses for certain situations]],
and
[[Our brain actively inhibits us from processing repressed emotions]].
That [[anxiety]] might be aware of something that [[consciousness|conscious]] you is not.

At the end of the day, the same [[feedback loop]] that fuels [[anxiety]] can be used to fuel [[confidence]]:
[[Confidence is a feedback loop]]

similarly:: [[Neurodiverse people can use their brain to their advantage]]
