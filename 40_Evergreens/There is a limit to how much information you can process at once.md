#### [[There is a limit to how much information you can process at once]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[We learn by transforming information into understanding]], so when we come across a new piece of [[information]] we often feel the urge to save it somehow, in the fear that we we will miss out of this opportunity to learning.
[[FOMO|Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO)]] can create [[friction]] in [[learning]] and lead to [[The Collector's Fallacy]], which will eventually lead you being overwhelmed.
[[Productivity tools are often most useful in how much work they inspire you to do]], 
so FOMO and other [[anxiety]] around not be able to get enough done are a net loss.

This is 
why:: [[A healthy second brain requires a surplus of entry points]]. 
If we are confident that information will eventually be reencountered when we put it in our [[second brain]], we can counter this [[anxiety]].
Additionally, [[Evergreen notes help us bridge the gap between knowledge and understanding]],
so they can increase the amount of information we can process.

part of:: [[We will evolve when we make learning as easy as thinking]]
