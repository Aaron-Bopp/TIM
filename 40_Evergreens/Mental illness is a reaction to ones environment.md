#### [[Mental illness is a reaction to ones environment]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Mental disorders]] can be brought on by internal stimuli (brain chemistry, [[neurodiversity]], hormones), or external stimuli ([[trauma]], [[socio-economic]] position, dangerous environments), but in both places mental illness is your brains' reaction to its environment.

This environment includes our physical environment (the one we experience), our chemical environment (what is going into the body, and what is the brain producing), and our emotional environment (how our brain is reacting to our physical and chemical environments).

While some of these stimuli are unavoidable ([[capitalism]]) other can be affected and regulated.

Ways to alter our environment:
- [[Tips for concentration]]
