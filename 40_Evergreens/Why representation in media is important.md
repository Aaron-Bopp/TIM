When Lily talks about the distraught she faced while in the closet,
I think that is an example of 
[[Self-hatred is born out of dissonance between self-image and self-perception]]. 
Part of the reason that coming out is such a big deal is because we live in such a strongly gendered [[society]]. 
This makes [[coming out]] more than it needs to be because there is a strong likelihood of backlash, which leads to [[Queer people]] repressing themselves,
^[[[Self-repression is the most natural response for trans people in strongly gendered environments]].]
which only makes being in the closet worse.

Representation in media is vitally important for this reason, because it allows Queer people to see an example of acceptance, 
and correct that dissonance between [[self-image]] and [[self-perception]].

The backlash against the push for representation in media is an example of: [[To those with privilege, losing it feels like oppression]].
People who fit into the status quo don't even understand why representation is important, because they have always been represented.
They feel like [[diversity]] is being forced because they have never noticed the lack of [[diversity]].
To them it feels like they are suddenly being lessened in importance, but that is only because they were being over-represented before.
In the end, they should be able to recognize
you don't need to be able to see yourself in everything, but everybody should be able to see themselves in something.
