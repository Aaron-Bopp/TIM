#### [[Negative influences impact us more than positive influences]] 

This is true especially in [[childhood]], because we [[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]], but it is also true as we try to [[socialization|socialize]] with others and seek out their [[validation]]. This is especially noticeable if you create things: one bad review is worse than a hundred good reviews: [[Longform media lets you reach people where they are at, short form media lets you reach people where you are at]]

There may be a root in [[Evolutionary Psychology]]
or it could be more related to [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]].
Either way, negative influences root their selves in our [[insecurity|insecurities]] and [[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]]. Valuing a negative [[influence]] more than a positive one could mean we are more prepared against negative outcomes.
