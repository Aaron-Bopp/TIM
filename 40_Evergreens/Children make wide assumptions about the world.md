#### [[Children make wide assumptions about the world]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This is because of [[How memory works]],
[[Negative influences impact us more than positive influences]],
and [[Our brain actively inhibits us from processing repressed emotions]].
This means the [[childhood]] is a time where we can form experience that shape the rest of our life:
[[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]

This leads to things such as:
- [[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]]
- [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]]
- [[Trans children will repress their dysphoria if they have been effectively taught it is unacceptable]]

This puts of lot of pressure on our [[parents]] as they have a massive ability to influence the assumptions:
[[How can parent's best help their children]]
