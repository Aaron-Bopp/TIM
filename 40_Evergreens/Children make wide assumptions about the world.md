#### [[Children make wide assumptions about the world]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This is because [[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]],
and [[Negative influences are stronger than positive influences]].

- [[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]]
- [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]]
- [[Our authority figures curate and reinforce what we are allowed to imitate]]
- [[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things]]
- [[How can parent's best help their children]]
- [[Knowledge of the world is painful]]
- [[Stupid rules are made to be broken]]  %% #TO/PONDER/ME  %%
- [[Trans children will repress their dysphoria if they have been effectively taught it is unacceptable]]
