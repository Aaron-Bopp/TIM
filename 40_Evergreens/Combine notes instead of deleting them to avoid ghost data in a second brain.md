#### [[Combine notes instead of deleting them to avoid ghost data in a second brain]] 

[[Deleting a note in a web of thought can have unforeseen consequences]] discusses how nodes metadata can last longer than their data. One way this happens is when you do not delete all links to a note before you delete a note. Instead of doing this, it is often possible to combine the note with another similar note, and let all the links be converted to that note. This can save a lot of [[friction]] when trying to delete your notes: [[The more mistakes you've fixed the more bad decisions you can afford# An experienced note taker knows when to just delete a note]]

The main benefit to combining over deleting is that any links to that note should be replaced with a similar note, but this can result in a different kind of mistake, where you may change the meaning of a note when it changes to the new note. So it may be useful to look through backlinks and see where you need to completely remove the link, remove the link but leave the text, change the link to something else or let it be merged with a new note. This is useful for dealing with [[The fragility of information in knowledge management]]

#### Counterpoint:: Let ghost data give you a clean slate

Sometimes there is note where I created it a long time ago, but the [[information]] within has never really matured and conflicts other notes, but I struggle to figure out what the real meaning of the note should be because I have so many preconceived notions. At times like this it can be helpful to just delete the note, but thanks to the backlinks not being deleted, whenever I come across them I have an opportunity to remake that note with a clean slate.
