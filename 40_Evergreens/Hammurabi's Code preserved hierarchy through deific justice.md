#### [[Hammurabi's Code preserved hierarchy through deific justice]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Hammurabi was ordained by the gods to be king and to have control. He was given the right to enforce the [[social hierarchy]] that the gods had laid out. Any punishment was not the decision of Hammurabi but his just following of the [[natural law]] set out by the gods.

The [[justice]] of [[Hammurabi's code]] is preserved through it's transactional nature. The reasoning is simple and laid out.
This may have been why is was an effective measure of [[social control]].
