#### [[Triggers activate stored emotional responses for certain situations]] 

Certain stimuli will bring you back to a certain moment.
Even if the moment it brings back to you wasn't specifically traumatic, the dissonance between that moment and your current beliefs may be triggering of other emotional reactions.

In [[Vedic Psychology]], this is a [[Samskara]]. When we first experience an emotion that reaction is stored in our and when we encounter that experience again that emotion is drawn just as it was when we first experienced. Over time, it is the job of our [[Buddhi]] to rewire how we respond to the experience, essentially lessening the power of the [[Samskara]].

- made worse by:: [[Our brain actively inhibits us from processing repressed emotions]]
- result of:: [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]]
- explains:: [[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]
