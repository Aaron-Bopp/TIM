#### [[Humans are a product of evolution]] 

In the same way that we can look at [[Giraffes]] and function of their long necks, 
we can look at human characteristics and see adaptive functionality.
[[Human evolution]] has shaped our body and psyche's in numerous ways.
We cannot overstate the influence of [[Evolution]] on [[human behavior]], 
but we also cannot see it as the only influence.
Remember:: [[Biological processes can only give context to behavior not predict it]].

[[Evolutionary Psychology]] is the study of how evolution enables certain behaviors, but doesn't predict them.
While we can look at a large scale for evolutionary traits,
we can't match them up to behaviors in individual people.

What this does mean is that
if we see [[human behavior]] manifesting regardless of upbringing and in multiple environment's,
we can start to look for a evolutionary explanation for that [[behavior]].

Traits that have a negative impact on the individual
should reduce the likely hood of that trait being passed on.
Traits that benefit the individual but negatively impact the group should also not be passed on.
Traits that hurt the individual but benefit the group should be passed on if the criteria for [[group selection]] are met.
Traits that promote selfishness should be passed on unless that trait breaks the rules of [[reciprocal altruism]].
Traits that do not have a functional purpose may be a [[spandrel]] or a result of [[sexual selection]].

This is a 
result of:: [[Natural selection is a designing agent]].
[[Natural selection]] has enabled certain types of behavior time, but it has also created systems that are selective.
^[[[Evolution can create systems capable of natural selection]]]
[[Human behavior is selective]].

- [[Our brains are built around survival]]
    - [[Neuroscience]]
    - [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]]
    - [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]]
- [[Humans love to group eachother]] <- [[kin selection]]
- [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]]
	- [[Humans transfer their wonder into creativity]]
	- [[Humans are drawn to the unknown and repelled by the known]]
	- [[Humans are designed to make certainty out of uncertainty]]
- [[The materialistic view of religions examines why humans invented and clung to religion]]
