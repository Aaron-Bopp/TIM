#### [[Humans are a product of evolution]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

If we see [[human behavior]] manifesting regardless of upbringing and in multiple environment's,
we can start to look for a evolutionary explanation for that [[behavior]].
^[remember:: [[Evolutionary Psychology is just a framework not a prescription of behavior]]]
This is because the [[natural selection]] process is purposeful in how it selects traits.

Traits that have a negative impact on the individual
should reduce the likely hood of that trait being passed on.
Traits that benefit the individual but negatively impact the group should also not be passed on.
Traits that hurt the individual but benefit the group should be passed on if the criteria for [[group selection]] are met.
Traits that promote selfishness should be passed on unless that trait breaks the rules of [[reciprocal altruism]].
Traits that do not have a functional purpose may be a [[spandrel]] or a result of [[sexual selection]].

- [[Our brains are built around survival]]
    - [[Neuroscience]]
    - [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]]
    - [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]]
- [[Humans love to group eachother]] <- [[kin selection]]
- [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]]
	- [[Humans transfer their wonder into creativity]]
	- [[Humans are drawn to the unknown and repelled by the known]]
- [[The materialistic view of religions examines why humans invented and clung to religion]]
