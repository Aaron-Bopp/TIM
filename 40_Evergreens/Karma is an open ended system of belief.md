#### [[Karma is an open ended system of belief]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Karma]] defines how the world works, instead of how you should work in the world.
This is what makes it an open-ended system of [[belief]] over [[Christianity]], or even some other [[eastern philosophy|eastern]] [[religion|religions]]. 
This is because [[Karma is based in the law of cause and effect]], but does not prescribe any actions based off of that observance.
While there are many beliefs that follow from this, believing in [[karma]] does not require following any of them.

- [[Right kinds of thoughts lead to right kinds of actions]]
- [[Accepting responsibility is not only about your actions]]
- [[You can't control what happens]]
