#### [[You will never be pushed to understand marginalization unless you are part of a marginalized group]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

For some it will be very difficult to fit their [[identity]] into the world around, so they will be forced to struggle through and find [[purpose]] and [[meaning]] in that journey, but others will fit in easily and never fully understand themselves. These people are taught to be [[ignorance|ignorant]] of [[struggle]]. This is the essence of [[privilege]], that you are allowed to [[ignorance|ignorant]] of other's [[oppression]].

This is 
part of why:: [[Worldviews should not make life seem easy and simple]]
and is
extremely key in:: [[Race is a social construct]]
