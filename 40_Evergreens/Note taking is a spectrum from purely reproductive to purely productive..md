#### [[Note taking is a spectrum from purely reproductive to purely productive.]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Conceptual notes]] notes that are purely taken on individual concepts
[[Sequential notes]] notes that are taken in the sequence of the thing they are notating like a lecture or book
transformative notes: notes that transform the material into things like questions and answers or prompts

##### What are the starter types of note taking?
> Flash cards (index cards you flip over like the kid game memory) / cornell notes (it's named for the school, no special meaning) / and "the index card method" which is simultaneously the same thing as flash cards and also the literal opposite
