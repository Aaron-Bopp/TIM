#### [[Theology preserves hierarchy through deific blessing]] 

This has included [[Christianity|Christian]] theologians claiming that all Africans are descended from Noah's son Ham, and that Noah's curse was passed on them causing them to be slaves. 
^[Especially ironic since we now know that all [[homo sapiens]] are originally African]

Less obviously some creation stories will prescribe certain races to soil or mud depending on their place in the [[social order]]. 
This not only separates classes in through deific blessing, but also through physical traits like purity.
This is 
displayed by:: [[The caste system preserved hierarchy through purity]].

- explained by:: [[Religion externalizes social control mechanisms]]
- part of:: [[Oppressors invent reasoning for their oppression]]
