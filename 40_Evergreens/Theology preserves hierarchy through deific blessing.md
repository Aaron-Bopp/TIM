#### [[Theology preserves hierarchy through deific blessing]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This has included [[Christianity|Christian]] theologians claiming that all Africans are descended from Noah's son Ham, and that Noah's curse was passed on them causing them to be slaves. 
^[Especially ironic since we now know that all [[homo sapiens]] are originally African]

Less obviously some creation stories will prescribe certain races to soil or mud depending on their place in the [[social order]]. 
This not only separates classes in through deific blessing, but also through physical traits like purity.
[[The caste system preserved hierarchy through purity]] is an example of this, as purity was both a physical reality and enforced by [[religion]].
