#### [[Your second brain should be an inspirational hub of creativity]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

If your primary goal is to create thought, then your system should be setup in a way that prioritizes that workflow. [[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]] is one such methodology, but your purposes and your mind will influence how you set up your [[second brain]]. Your mind may gravitate towards structure and routine, or it may yearn for the freedom of spontaneus creation. Either way, the act of creating your [[knowledge management|knowledge management system]] can be used as a catalyst or conduit to create thought: [[Learning how systems work can be a gateway to creating thought]]

One universal truth is that your [[second brain]] should not be a hindrance to creating. [[Friction is the number one hindrance to learning]] and [[Fear is the number one hindrance to trying]], so [[When in doubt, write what you think]]

Structure is only helpful in that it reduces friction, but it should not be a hindrance to your creativity: [[Only use organization systems as far as they are useful]]

As you are creating thought it is important to recoginize [[The fragility of nodes in a second brain]]:
- [[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]]
- [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]]
- [[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge]]
