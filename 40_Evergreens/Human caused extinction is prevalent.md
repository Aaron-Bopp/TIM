#### [[Human caused extinction is prevalent]] 

From our very humble beginnings,
^[[[Cracking bones and eating the marrow may have been human's first niche]]]
human's have developed into the top predator and a force of destruction on par with asteroids in terms of extinct species.

From our prehistoric hunting of mammoths in [[Siberia]],
to our mass extinctions in [[Australia]] and [[America]], 
to man-made [[climate change]],
we are by far the most destructive force in history in zoological terms,
driving [up to one million](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01448-4) species extinct.


- part of:: [[Greater cooperation and communication has lead to the success of humans as a species]]
- explained by:: [[Humans have had little time to adjust to being the top predator]]
