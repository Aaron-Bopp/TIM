#### [[Human caused extinction is prevalent]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

From our very humble beginnings,
^[[[Cracking bones and eating the marrow may have been human's first niche]]]
human's have developed into the top predator and a force of destruction on par with asteroids in terms of extinct species.

Examples:: Australia and the Americas had many megafaunas and large creatures like groundsloths before we settled there. There aren't any good explanations for those extinctions other than us.

- [[Greater cooperation and communication has lead to the success of humans as a species]]
- [[Humans have had little time to adjust to being the top predator]]
