#### [[Capitalism necessitates class division]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

One of the successes of the [[Rise of Modern Conservatism]] is to have convinced [[Conservatism|Conservatives]] that capitalism works for the working class by demonizing [[Communism]] and shifting the [[Overton window]] so far right: [[McCarthyism is an attack on totalitarianism not communism]] 

[[Ronald Reagan invented modern conservatism]], and claimed to support [[supply-side economics]], but eventually had to use much more [[progressive]] legislation to stop [[economy|economic]] problems during his terms in order to support the [[middle class]]: [[Republican voters do not hold their leaders accountable]]

Everybody can't be a capitalist.
