#### [[You should the love the loves of those who you love]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[Loving the Loves of Your Loves - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZhnL_cTrfQ) from [[John Green]]

Mirroring the joy that your loved ones is a basic way of showing your love for them.

I think this generally a great thing to do for other people especially those who you [[love]],
and is probably a pretty natural thing in general: 
[[Humans love to group eachother]]
