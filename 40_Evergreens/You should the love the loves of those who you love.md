#### [[You should the love the loves of those who you love]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Mirroring the joy of your loved ones is a basic way of showing your love for them.
This is the most basic form of [[empathy]], 
I think this generally a great thing to do for other people especially those who you [[love]],
and is probably a pretty natural thing in general: 
[[Humans love to group eachother]]
