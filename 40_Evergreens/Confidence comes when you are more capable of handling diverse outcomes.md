#### [[Confidence comes when you are more capable of handling diverse outcomes]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Confidence]] can also come when you are unaware of potential outcomes, but this confidence will quickly be shattered when things go wrong. In the long run being able to handle when things go wrong will give you much more peace of mind. 

This aspect of [[confidence]] makes it the 
counter to:: [[anxiety]].
%% #TO/TEND/WEED %%
[[Anxiety stems from a lack of confidence for the future]] and
[[Anxiety prevents us from living in the present]] by focusing on all the possible outcomes of an event.
This can be quite taxing when when we have to prepare for each of these scenarios,
but if we are confident in our abilities to do so it will lessen our [[anxiety]].


If your [[confidence]] is eroded in this area it can lead to [[depression]]:
[[Depression is past focused, hopelessness is future focused]]
