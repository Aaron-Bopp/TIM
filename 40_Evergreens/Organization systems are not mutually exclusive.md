#### [[Organization systems are not mutually exclusive]] 

part of:: [[Prioritize understanding over organization or categorization]]

The beauty of the digital age is that hardly anything boxes us in any more. 
I can have an [[Obsidian (software)|Obsidian]] vault inside my [[Obsidian (software)|Obsidian]] vault, I can use folders and tags and outlines to organize my notes in completely different ways, or I can use them all in the same way, or I can use each one in multiple ways. 
The possibilities are endless,
[[heterarchy]] or [[hierarchy]],
[[Johnny Decimal System|Johnny Decimal]] or [[Dewey Decimal System|Dewey Decimal]],
tags or links,
and yet people still ask for the "right" way to organize. 

The problem isn't that there is no "right" way to organize, it's that we should never be looking for only one way to organize.
Most of the time, organization systems don't even conflict because they are completely different paradigms. 
^[Usually if have to use only one organization system it is because you are working as a team at a organization or university, whether or not that system is good is one thing, but having everyone use the same system has it's advantages]

You can take advantage of the [[Densely linked webs of thought provide intuitive access to knowledge|intuitive access of a web of thought]] while also benefitting from the [[Decimal based organization systems provide the easiest access to common notes|easy top level access that decimal based systems provide]]. You can [[Use Obsidian tags as temporal classifiers]] and to organize knowledge, or you can forego tags entirely and just use [[topic notes]].
In my vault I make use of the [[Johnny Decimal System]], [[MOC]]s, outlines, tags, indexes and folders. I have folders that are made up by the type of note, this structure is mirrored in tags, but there are some small differences 
^[my personal notes are in a different folder from my [[evergreen notes]], but they still have the evergreen tag]
that make having both valuable.

A good first step is, [[Only organize as much as your data requires]]. If you don't even have a enough notes to overflow your file explorer, you probably don't need to be thinking to hard about [[organization]].
For me the next step was to [[Using spaced repetition for your conceptual notes]], but depending on your use case this might be different.
In the end:: [[Write your notes with a system not within a system]]
