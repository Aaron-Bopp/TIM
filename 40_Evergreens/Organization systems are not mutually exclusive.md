#### [[Organization systems are not mutually exclusive]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Tags provide flexibility, mocs provide structure.
MOCs provide flexibility, Folder provide portability
Johnny decimal categorizes, MOCs orgnanize
Interlinking provides connection, MOCs provide structure

There is simply no reason to limit yourself to one organization system if you can help it. Most of the time organization systems don't even conflict because they are completely different paradigms. In my vault I make use of the [[Johnny Decimal System]], [[MOC]]s, outlines, tags, indexes and folders. I have folder that are made up by the type of note, this structure is mirrored in tags, but there are some small differences (my personal notes are in a different folder from my evergreen notes, but they still have the evergreen tag) that make having both valuable. I can use either tags or file paths to do queries. I follow the johny decimal system of divide into ten things to create outlines, but I have all the files flat in the folder. This means I get the benefits of having a flat folder structure and I get to organize things into categories
