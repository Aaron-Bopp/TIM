#### [[An experienced note taker knows how to work efficiently]]

#TO/TEND/WATER 
This means knowing when you can offload work to your [[second brain]] and free yourself to do the more important work.
For me one of the major [[friction]]s of [[note writing|note taking]] is deciding when to do work.
[[Productivity tools are often most useful in how much work they inspire you to do]] and my [[second brain]] inspires me to do so much work, but sometimes I will put time into a task I know I want to get done, but after putting five or ten minutes into it, I am less happy than I was before. 
I can alleviate this by ignoring that task until I feel inspired to do it.
You can do this through [[my TO(DO) and EVER(GREEN) structure]], by cataloguing work that would like to do and tackling it when you are in the right headspace.
You can ignore breaking your concentration to fill out a new note, knowing that the title and backlinks will remind you when you look at it again.
You can safely move a note out of your inbox knowing that [[spaced repetition]] will bring it up again.
