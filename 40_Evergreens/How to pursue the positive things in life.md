#### [[How to pursue the positive things in life]] 

The hardest part about pursuing the positive things in life is our conditions on both a material and spiritual level.
[[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]],
and getting your [[mental health]] in order is going to be vital to pursue [[happiness]].
Meanwhile, [[Sometimes we can't grow until we change our environment]] 
so trying to improve your [[mental health]] may be very difficult.

I think the root of these difficulties is in the answer to  [[What is the cognitive effect of living in an unjust world]],
but often we are not thinking about the world when we are stalled, we are just lost in our own lives.
