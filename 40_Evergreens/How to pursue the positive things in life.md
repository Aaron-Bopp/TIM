#### [[How to pursue the positive things in life]] 

The hardest part about pursuing the positive things in life is our conditions on both a material and spiritual level.
On a material level [[Insecure material conditions increase cognitive load and reduce outcomes]].
This is a big part of [[You can't blame people for failing to rise above their circumstances]] and can make it very hard for us make progress towards things that we want even if we have the desire.
On a spiritual level,
[[Right kinds of thoughts lead to right kinds of actions]].
We need to properly center our lives around the things that truly matter.
Complicating all of this is
[[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]].
Getting your [[mental health]] in order is going to be vital to pursue [[happiness]].
Meanwhile, [[Sometimes we can't grow until we change our environment]] 
so trying pursuing any of these paths may be impossible without making significant changes.

I think the root of these difficulties is in the answer to  [[What is the cognitive effect of living in an unjust world]],
but often we are not thinking about the world when we are stalled, we are just lost in our own lives.
