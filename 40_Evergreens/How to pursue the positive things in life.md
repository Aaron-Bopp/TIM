#### [[How to pursue the positive things in life]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

**Why do we *stall* in life**? #TO/PONDER/SOCIETY

Statistically it seems likely that
[[The most reliable path to success is repeatedly trying to succeed]]
might be true.

[[Buddhism]] might suggest that the key is in having the right thoughts, 
because [[Right kinds of thoughts lead to right kinds of actions]].
In this case, [[meditation]] will be one of your key practices:: [[Meditation is a practice to gain control over your thoughts]]

The hardest part about pursuing the positive things in life is our conditions on both a material and spiritual level.
[[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]],
and getting your [[mental health]] in order is going to be vital to pursue [[happiness]].
Meanwhile, [[Sometimes we can't grow until we change our environment]] 
and [[Insecure material conditions increase cognitive load and reduce outcomes]],
so trying to improve your [[mental health]] may be very difficult.

I think the root of these difficulties is in the answer to  [[What is the cognitive effect of living in an unjust world]].

#TO/TEND/GRAFT 
- [[Happiness is enlightenment and sadness is delusion]]
	- [[Humans have decided to reject an unjust world]]
	- [[Hope is not optimism it is a practice for producing change]]
	- [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]]
- [[sometimes we can't grow until we change our environment]]
	- [[we are confined to the tools of our time]]
	- [[how can parent's best help their children]]
- [[You should the love the loves of those who you love]]
- [[Be the change you want to see in the world]]
