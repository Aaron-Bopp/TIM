#### [[The history of meditation is a mixture of science and spirituality]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Eastern philosophy]] is often viewed as much more spiritual than [[Western philosophy]]
^[or at least seems to be to me, as [[Western philosophy]] is largely [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Christianity]] is based in your relationship with [[god]]]
yet as we continue to reexamine ancient techniques such as [[yoga]] and [[meditation]] and beliefs such as [[Buddhism]] and [[karma]] in the light of modern research we see them hold true.
This could be attributed to [[survivorship bias]], but it could also be attributed to the methods that [[Yogi|Yogis]] used to examine and understand what they were teaching.
