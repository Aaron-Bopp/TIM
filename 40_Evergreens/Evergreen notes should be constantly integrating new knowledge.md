#### [[Evergreen notes should be constantly integrating new knowledge]] 

part of:: [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]]

With [[evergreen notes]],
you don't need to have a fully formulated idea to start writing, so 
[[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]].
As you continue to spend time with your notes you will develop them, not just based on the idea's you had at the time, but on new ideas. As you reread over old notes you will find connections to new notes or old notes that you have new understanding of. In this way,
[[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]].

The details of this are bit more complicated.
Without constant vigilance our [[second brain]] will fall into disrepair
because:: of [[The fragility of information in knowledge management]].
