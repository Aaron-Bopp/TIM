#### [[Evergreen notes should be constantly integrating new knowledge]] 

When first [[learning]] about a subject, you are actually likely to make notes about the largest and most general concepts first,
because experts in those subjects are likely to share their conclusions without requiring you to understand the mechanics behind them.
Then if we decide we do want to further our understanding,
ideas that may have just been a sentence two at first, slowly become large enough in your mind to become their own notes.
Instead splitting your initial note into much smaller pieces
you can take advantage of [[Conceptual notes vary in size and scope]]
and make this note an entry point leading to the smaller concepts within in it.
Thankfully, [[Note titles should be abstractions of the note content]], makes this incredibly easy.
You can often just take sentences and
slightly refactor them into links to reflect
your deeper understanding.

> Every note linked out from that note was either created after or at the same time, and most of the notes created after are actually explanations for that trait not results.

- part of:: [[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]]
- works with:: [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]]

What if our learning works the opposite way, and we actually can't even begin to understand the conclusions until we know the basics?
Well the process works just as well in the other direction.
We write small in concept, but highly technical notes to develop our intuition, and as we learn more we connect those notes together to create of [[web of thought]].
Suddenly we have a springboard to launch us into making powerful insights, and we have a place to fall back to if we get struck by confusion.
