#### [[Evergreen notes should be constantly integrating new knowledge]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Thankfully, [[evergreen notes]] makes this incredibly easy,
because:: [[Conceptual notes vary in size and scope]].
When first [[learning]] about a subject, you are actually likely to make notes about the largest concepts first.
It's only with concerted effort and time that you can start to understand the lower level concepts.
This means that ideas that may have just been a sentence two at first, slowly become large enough in your mind to become their own notes.
Instead of just adding that information into your original notes, or completely recreating the note, 
because:: [[Note titles should be abstractions of the note content]],
you can often just slightly refactor the note to link to your deeper understanding.

> [!example]
> [[Your anxiety is telling you everything that could go wrong, not what will go wrong]] was one
> of my first notes, created in June 2021.
> Every note linked out from that note was either created after or at the same time, and most of the notes created after are actually explanations for that trait not results.
> Despite that, the note title has never changed, and the scope has stayed relatively the same, but my [[understanding]] has gotten much deeper.
> Over time I was able to change sentences into links, and add causes to observations.
