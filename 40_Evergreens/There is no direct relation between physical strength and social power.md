#### [[There is no direct relation between physical strength and social power]] 

Strength and [[violence]] have always been seen as the root of [[Patriarchy]], 
but the evidence behind that [[belief]] is lacking.
Pound for pound women are behind men, 
%% #TO/DO/CITE %% 
but life isn't a weight lifting competition.
Women outperform men in resistance and endurance.
Indeed, women have often been the ones engaging hard physical labor, such as [[farming]].

There is a proportion of women that are stronger and faster than some men, 
but the same proportion does not live up for societies with and without [[Patriarchy]].

Therefore, this is likely not the
answer of:: [[What is the origin of patriarchy]]
