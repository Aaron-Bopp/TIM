#### [[There is no direct relation between physical strength and social power]] 

Strength and [[violence]] have always been seen as the root of [[Patriarchy]], 
but the evidence behind that [[belief]] is lacking.
Pound for pound women are behind men, 
but life isn't a weight lifting competition.
Women often outperform men in resistance and endurance,
and just because there are average differences in strength and size does not mean that all men have more physical strength than all women.
%% Indeed, women have often been the ones engaging hard physical labor, such as [[farming]]. %%

In modern society, we have often gatekept the professions with the least physical labor for themselves such as clerics and politicians.
While men were often the hunters in hunter-gatherer society,
that is likely more a result of social elements than purely physical ones, as much hunting does not require direct strength but rather willingness to be alone for hours on end.


Therefore, this is likely not the
answer of:: [[What is the origin of patriarchy]]
