#### [[There is no direct relation between physical strength and social power]] 

Strength and [[violence]] have always been seen as the root of [[Patriarchy]], 
but the evidence behind that [[belief]] is lacking.
Pound for pound women are behind men, 
but life isn't a weight lifting competition.
Women outperform men in resistance and endurance.
Indeed, women have often been the ones engaging hard physical labor, such as [[farming]].
While men where often the hunters in hunter-gatherer society,
that is likely more a result of social elements than purely physical ones, as much hunting does not require direct strength but rather willingness to be alone for hours on end.

In modern society have often gatekept the professions with the least physical labor for themselves such as clerics and politicians.

Therefore, this is likely not the
answer of:: [[What is the origin of patriarchy]]

> ![[^^the greater power observed across
