#### [[There is no direct relation between physical strength and social power]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Strength and [[violence]] have always been seen as the root of [[Patriarchy]], 
but the evidence behind that [[belief]] is lacking.
Pound for pound women are behind men, 
%% #TO/DO/CITE %% 
but life isn't a weight lifting competition and woman out perform in resistance and endurance than men.
Indeed, woman have often been the ones engaging hard physical labor such as [[farming]].

There are many women that are stronger and faster than many men, 
but the same proportion does not live up for societies with and without [[Patriarchy]].

Therefore this is likely not the
answer of:: [[What is the origin of patriarchy]]
