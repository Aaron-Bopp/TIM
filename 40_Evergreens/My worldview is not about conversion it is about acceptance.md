#### [[My worldview is not about conversion it is about acceptance]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

While I am an atheist, I don't really try to convert people, I still have lots of good relationships with Christians, and I still see value in [[faith]]. When I discuss [[belief]] and [[worldview]] with other people, I want to learn about how they see and understand the world so that I can better understand them and update my [[worldview]].

I can't deny Christianity's successes because
[[The materialistic view of religions examines why humans invented and clung to religion]].
[[Christianity|Christians]] have done good in this world and I must acknowledge it, but that does not mean I excuse harmful behaviors. 

[[Faith can be a useful tool for grounding yourself]],
but because [[Belief reinforces your worldview]] it can 
make people resistant to change. 
In general, people do not like to view themselves as the bad guy, so if I can put myself in their shoes I do not see them as the bad guy either,
^[[[Empathy isn't understanding how you would make the decision it's understanding why they made the decision]], but [[Empathy does not disallow judgment]]]
but due to the way [[Christianity]] answers [[The three main questions of life]], it allows for blind spots that christians need to repeatedly work through.
^[[[What are the blindspots of the Christian worldview]]]

In my experience, Christian's views are not inherently objectionable.
It is their unwillingness to change their [[understanding]], or misguided support of harmful practices that are objectionable.
^[
This is sometimes the result of personal choices:
[[Searching for THE answer is dangerous]] 
Or it is caused by a lack of need or want to break out of their limited [[worldview]]:
[[You will never be pushed to understand marginalization unless you are part of a marginalized group]]]
It's only when I find that their [[worldview]] is guiding them towards these things that I try to change their mind.
^[Unfortunately, [[We are confined to the tools of our time]], so this is often difficult to impossible]
