#### [[My worldview is not about conversion it is about acceptance]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

While I am an atheist, I don't really try to convert people, I still have lots of good relationships with Christians, and I still see value in [[faith]]. When I discuss [[belief]] and [[worldview]] with other people it is not my intention to convert them, rather I want to learn about how they see and understand the world so that I can better understand them, and learn from them.

In my experience, most people's [[worldview]]s are not inherently objectionable.
It is their apathy towards [[injustice]], or misguided support of it that is objectionable.
^[
This is sometimes the result of personal choices:
[[Searching for THE answer is dangerous]] 
Or it is caused by a lack of need or want to break out of their limited [[worldview]]:
[[You will never be pushed to understand marginalization unless you are part of a marginalized group]]]
It's only when I find that their [[worldview]] is guiding them towards these things that I attack it: [[Transformative justice is the alternative to punitive justice]]

In general, people do not like to view themselves as the bad guy, so if I can put myself in their shoes I do not see them as the bad guy either.
^[[[Empathy isn't understanding how you would make the decision it's understanding why they made the decision]], but [[Empathy does not disallow judgment]]]
I understand why people have faith, because [[Faith can be a useful tool for grounding yourself]],
but I know that because [[Faith is an abstraction of cognitive dissonance]] it can often mask harmful beliefs. 
Due to the way [[Christianity]] answers [[The three main questions of life]], it allows for blind spots that christians need to repeatedly work through,
%% #TO/PONDER/IDEA of the blindpsots that [[Christianity]] creates %%
this is why [[Christians struggle to feel empathy because they must believe that non-christians are going to hell]].
My ability to empathize cannot get in the way of holding people accountable for beliefs
that either directly or indirectly hurt others, just as how
[[Fear cannot be a deterrent for deconstructing your faith]]

In addition, [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]], if [[Christianity|Christians]] have done good in this world I must acknowledge it, but that does not mean I excuse harmful behaviors, 
especially in the case of children: [[Religious concepts are often too powerful for a child's mind]]
