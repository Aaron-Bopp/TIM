#### [[My worldview is not about conversion it is about acceptance]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

While I am an atheist, I don't really try to convert people, I still have lots of good relationships with Christians, and I still see value in [[faith]]. When I discuss belief and [[worldview]] with other people it is not my intention to convert them, rather I want to learn about how they see and understand the world so that I can better understand them, and learn from them.

In my experience most people's [[worldview]]s are not inherently objectionable, it is their apathy towards [[injustice]], or misguided support of it that is objectionable. In general people do not like to view themselves as the bad guy, so if I can put myself in their shoes I do not see them as the bad guy either. This ability to empathize cannot get in the way of holding people accountable for beliefs that either directly or indirectly hurt others. [[Empathy does not dissallow judgment]]
