#### [[You can be taught to invalidate your own emotions]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Our authority figures curate and reinforce what we are allowed to imitate]], and in [[childhood]] our most prominent authority figures are our [[parents]]. If our parents model [[emotional invalidation]] or invalidate us, we will learn this [[behavior]].

This can be especially dangerous for [[neurodiversity|neurodiverse]] and [[transgender|trans]] children because [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]]. These two populations are especially at risk because of the power of their [[brain]]s and the seriousness of their [[cognitive dissonance]]. 
^[
For neurodivergent kids this lies more in
[[Neurodivergent people cannot stop their brain from solving problems]] 
and for trans kids it lies more in 
how [[Our understanding of gender begins at a very early age]]
and [[Children make wide assumptions about the world]] 
but these populations heavily overlap anyways
]

For example, [[Trans children will repress their dysphoria if they have been effectively taught it is unacceptable]] which is why [[You can discover your transness at any point in life]].
