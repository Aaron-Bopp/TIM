#### [[What is the link between evolution and social behavior]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Functionally integrated social groups become organisms in their own right]] explores how eukaryotic cells are actually highly integrated groups of [[bacteria]], which hints at the social element of [[Genetic evolution]]

> Intragenomic conflict refers to the evolutionary phenomenon where genes have phenotypic effects that promote their own transmission in detriment of the transmission of other genes that reside in the same genome. The selfish gene theory postulates that natural selection will increase the frequency of those genes whose phenotypic effects cause their transmission to new organisms, and most genes achieve this by cooperating with other genes in the same genome to build an organism capable of reproducing and/or helping kin to reproduce. The assumption of the prevalence of intragenomic cooperation underlies the organism-centered concept of inclusive fitness. However, conflict among genes in the same genome may arise both in events related to reproduction (a selfish gene may "cheat" and increase its own presence in gametes or offspring above the expected according to fair Mendelian segregation and fair gametogenesis) and altruism (genes in the same genome may disagree on how to value other organisms in the context of helping kin because coefficients of relatedness diverge between genes in the same genome).

leads to:: [[Evolution can create systems capable of natural selection]]

This
explains:: [[Moral social control promotes pro-social behavior in groups]]
as we can now see [[social control]] as a trait that [[Genetic evolution]] can select for.
