#### [[What is the link between evolution and social behavior]] 

[[David Sloan Wilson]] would probably say that link is in [[group selection]]. 
According to him, [[Group selection solves the fundamental problem of social life]], being that it transfers social fitness into biological fitness through competition between groups. This is not just a theory of [[social behavior]], but also of [[natural selection]]. 
[[Highly integrated social control allows groups to act as adaptive units]] examines the way that [[social control]] effects fitness from cults to chromosomes, 
as well as exploring how eukaryotic cells are actually highly integrated groups of [[bacteria]].
While Wilson acknowledges that are still limits to the application of group selection, 
he would likely cite a connection between its effect on small scales to the existence of [[social behavior]].

This 
leads to:: [[Evolution can create systems capable of natural selection]]

This
explains:: [[Social control promotes highly altruistic behavior within groups]]
as we can now see [[social control]] as a trait that [[Genetic evolution]] can select for.
