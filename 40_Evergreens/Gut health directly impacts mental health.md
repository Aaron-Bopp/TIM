#### [[Gut health directly impacts mental health]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This phenomena is now being referred to as the [[brain-gut axis]],
but this has been a practice of [[Ayurveda]] for millennia.

Our understanding of this is that the [[bacteria]] in our [[gut]] are a vital part of producing [[Neurotransmitter]]'s like [[Serotonin]].
^[[[notes_Brain Gut Axis]]]

- [[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]]
- [[Drugs work by effecting your chemical environment]]
- [[The immune system is adaptive]]
