#### [[Farming outcompeted foraging by allowing for higher populations]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

> ![[books_Sapiens#^297301079]]

As early humans transitioned from [[human foraging]] to [[farming]], their overall quality of life went down not up. Plague's of infectious [[disease]] and starvation were unheard of in foraging times, partially because [[Foraging kept populations down]] and because [[Foraging allowed for a diverse diet]], but mainly because their were never enough people around for their deaths to classify as a plague.

In reality farming lead to a variety of problems. Injuries were common as the human body was not adapted to a life of tilling fields and hauling chaff.

As everyone was needed in the fields, mother spent less time nursing their children, which lead to weaker immune systems and higher child mortality.

However, farming was able to overtake foraging as the main method of survival in just few millennia by capitalizing on [[Evolution]]. Simply by influencing humans to have more children, evolution was able to overcome the disadvantages of farming life.

This was not the only evolutionary force acting on humans, as [[Wheat domesticated humans]].

This is part of [[Greater cooperation and communication has lead to the success of humans as a species]]
