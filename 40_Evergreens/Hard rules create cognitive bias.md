#### [[Hard rules create cognitive bias]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`


> [!example]
> The [[Spaced Repetition (plugin)]] has inperfect support for nested tags. This means that when I try to review \#node/evergreen notes, it will not give me \#node/evergreen/technique notes. This lead to remove that sub tag and making it it's own \#node/technique. Does this mean this classifcation was incorrect? No, as I also tagged those notes with \#node/evergreen. All this lead to was a loss of information, due to a hard rule in [[software]].
