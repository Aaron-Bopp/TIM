#### [[The five star scale is for consumer and the ten point scale is for critiques]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

You may be thinking, this isn't right, isn't the five star scale a mini version of the ten point scale? My answer is no.
The five star scale has it's origin's in consumer reviews. First for hotels then restaurants and after the advent of the [[internet]], everything. 
We can now leave five star rating's and reviews on everything from our underwear to our favorite tv show. 
The question is, what do different amounts of stars mean, and why do we view them as a reliable source of [[information]]. The answer is it depends and we shouldn't.

Any person with buyer's anxieties can tell you about the unreliability of Amazon reviews. 
We are much more scared of a 4.9 with 10 reviews than a 4.6 with a 1000 reviews, and yet we might be willing to buy a 3.6 with 100 reviews.
This isn't just because of the doubtless amounts of fake reviews, but it is about the fact that we know that the review writer's are unreliable.
Joe from Missouri might given one star because he got a broken product but didn't update his rating when he was shipped a replacement, while Sally from Washington might have rated her's five stars when she's only had it for a day.
Actually using the reviews on a product involves actually looking through them, seeing what has happened and to see what you can expect.
The thing is, this doesn't mean 5-star reviews are pointless, in fact this is almost how they should work.

There is a difference between a consumer and a creator, a consumer review and critique, a online comment and personal suggestion, the difference is whether we should be trusting the person.
The fact is that most people don't put too much weight behind a five star review, or even if they do you don't know if they are well versed enough to tell the difference between something good and something great.
The five star review module is one without nuance, on most sites you can't even rate by half stars.
Most things are made to be consumed by thousands of people, we can't expect all of them to have intimate knowledge of the artform or have a refined taste of what they are consuming. 
That is entire point of the consumer review, it is meant to be for the common person to share their thoughts. 
This is where the beauty of the five star model comes in,
most people will give something good or great a four or five star review, but also those people couldn't be trusted to distinguish between 6.6 and a 8.9.

Now, I am not saying that I have not found timeless wisdom in a 5 star reviews, but most of that wisdom has come from reviews of washing machines or vacuum cleaners. 
I simply don't trust a random person's opinion on a piece of art like a movie or a tv show.
When I write a five star review, I do it with as much care as I think other should, which is not much.
This doesn't mean my five star reviews are inaccurate to what I thought of the product, in fact they are likely more accurate to your experience that somebody who holds back their five star review for something "flawless"
