#### [[Buddhism is the study of happiness through detachment]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

The nature of [[happiness]] is not doing what you [[love]] its [[emotional detachment|detachment]] from the decisions of the life.
We can see a basis for this in [[Attachment fuels anxiety]].
If we can attach from the unnecessary burdens of life we can lessen our [[anxiety]] and increase our [[happiness]].
This detachment is not [[nihilism]], it is not giving up, it is a process of letting go.
That is the source of true [[happiness]].
Detachment is separation from the axis of [[emotions]].
It's like finding enjoyment in a scary movie,
you can be tantalized by your fear response because you know that you aren't going to die.
[[Enlightenment]] is a state of consistent [[happiness]].
[[Dr. K]] talks about this here: [Dr. Mike Talks with Harvard Psychiatrist Dr. K](https://youtu.be/T_31hFh1XKM?t=4618)

The reason this is enlightening is due to the fact of [[Karma Fal]] or [[You can't control what happens]].
If we accept this and move forward anyways that is the opposite of [[nihilism]] that is true [[optimism]].

I think we can see this in how [[Buddhism]] was spread vs other [[religion|religions]].
