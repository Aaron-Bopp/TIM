#### [[Radicalization is when you are convinced that the things you need to change are out of your control]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

The incel movement is based of two major things
1. [[mysogyny]]
2. the myth of the chad

The myth of the chad is the thing that is important here. This is the idea that the only kind of man that is appealing to [[women]] is once who fit's into a very narrow definition of attractiveness. This leas many incels to feelings of almost [[body dysmorphia]] where they are completely unable to accept their [[body]]. You can see then that [[mysogyny]] really lies in this as well, and the root of this [[insecurity]] is toxic [[gender roles]] and [[Patriarchy]].

This ideal body is completely unattainable and that is what leads incels to Radicalization or the "red pill."

An interesting connection may be to left-wing radicals, who are radicalized by the complete brokeness of the system.
