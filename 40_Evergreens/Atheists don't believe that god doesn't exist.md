#### [[Atheists don't believe that god doesn't exist]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

You can't believe a negative. 
Their [[belief]] is based on either
they believe that they don't need to believe,
or they believe in something else.

The first requires a massive capacity for [[cognitive dissonance]], which most atheists don't have.
The second is much more broad, and can mean a variety of things.
1. They believe in the process of science
2. They believe in themselves

Atheists insistence that god doesn't exist is an acknowledgement of these other beliefs.
If they believe in science, they believe that there is not enough evidence for god.
If they believe in themselves, they just don't believe they can be wrong.
