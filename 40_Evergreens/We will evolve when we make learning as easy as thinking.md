#### [[We will evolve when we make learning as easy as thinking]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This is the aspiration of [[My TIM]], and is reflected in it's core goals:
[[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge]]
and [[Your second brain should be an inspirational hub of creativity]].

#TO/TEND/GRAFT 
- [[Friction is a hindrance to learning]]
- [[A totally integrated machine should be infinitely scalable]]
- [[A totally integrated machine should automate as much of the thinking process as possible]]
- [[We are confined to the tools of our time]]
- [[Humans have decided to reject an unjust world]], but [[cognitive dissonance]] prevents us from realizing this dream, hence [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]]
