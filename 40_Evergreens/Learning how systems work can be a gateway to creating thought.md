#### [[Learning how systems work can be a gateway to creating thought]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

How we understand a system influences how we use that system, and the systems we have learned in the past influence decisions we make in new systems. 
A system that gives too much freedom, or too many options, may only reduce your ability to create.
^[this is part of why [[Powerful tools make dangerous toys]]]
At some point, you need to find the tool that works best for you and that may be a more restrictive tool like [[Roam Research (software)|Roam Research]], or less restrictive like [[Obsidian (software)|Obsidian]].

Even within these tools, there are many [[systems for thought]] that will influence how you use them. People will often be locked into indecision because their tool is too open, and does not force them into one system. 
While this can be overwhelming it is also what make these tools great.
In the end, 
[[Productivity tools are often most useful in how much work they inspire you to do]], so you should choose the tool that works best for you:
[[Choosing a note writing system is choosing a system for thought]]

##### What did [[evergreen notes]] teach me

For me the thing that evergreen notes really unlocked for me was [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]].
This is why I say,  [[When in doubt, write what you think]], and [[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]], as I believe that taking the first step is often the hardest.
[[My TIM]] is what has come of this, is an amalgamation of many different system that have learned and absorbed. 

I also learned that [[Names matter because they effect people's perception and understanding]].
This is why [[Conceptual note is a better term than atomic note]] because it influences how people interpret and design their [[knowledge management|personal knowledge system]].

For more:: [[Communities are knowledge graphs]]

##### Counter:: systems create hard rules and [[Hard rules create cognitive bias]]

Learning systems can help create thought, but it does so by [[influence|influencing]] thought. This means that if a system is pointing you in the wrong direction it will negatively impact your ability to create and learn. 
^[[[The way systems work can create cognitive bias]]]
This is why you should [[Prioritize understanding over organization or categorization]]. 

Here are some thoughts that may guide how you decide on and create your system with creating hard rules: 
- [[Write your notes with a system not within a system]]
- [[Note structures should help curate knowledge]]
- [[Friction is a hindrance to learning]]
- [[The fragility of information in knowledge management]]
