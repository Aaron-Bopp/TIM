#### [[Learning how systems work can be a gateway to creating thought]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

How we understand a system influences how we use that system, and the systems we have learned in the past influence decisions we make in new systems. 
This is why [[Conceptual notes are lexically superior to atomic notes]] because it influences how people interperet and design their [[knowledge management|personal knowledge system]].

A system that gives too much freedom, or too many options, may only reduce your ability to create, this is part of why [[Powerful tools make dangerous toys]]. At some point, you need to find the tool that works best for you and that may be a more restrictive tool like [[Roam Research (software)]], or less restrictive like [[Obsidian (software)]]. Even within these tools, there are many systems of thought that will influence how you use them. People will often be locked into indecesion because their tool is too open, and does not force them into one system. While this can be overwhelming it is also what make these tools great. This is why I say,  [[When in doubt, write what you think]], and [[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]].  [[My TIM]] is what I have decided is the best system for me, but it is in itself a amalgamation of many different system that I have built over time.

Here are some thoughts that may guide how you decide on and create your system
- [[Note structures should help curate knowledge]]
- [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]]
- [[Prioritize organization over categorization to avoid cognitive bias]]
- [[Friction is the number one hindrance to learning]]
- [[The fragility of nodes in a second brain]]
