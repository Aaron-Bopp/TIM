#### [[Write your notes with a system not within a system]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Choosing a note writing system is choosing a system for thought]],
but [[Organization systems are not mutually exclusive]].
Don't let yourself get bogged down with questions like, "Am I using the system the way the creator intended?" 

[[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]], let yourself find what works along the way.
[[Learning how systems work can be a gateway to creating thought]] so 
shop around and experiment with different systems.
[[A healthy second brain requires a surplus of entry points]] so the more tools you can find the more productive you will be:
[[Better tools allow us to be less disciplined and more productive]]

- [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]]
- [[Use philosophies as far they are useful and nothing more]]
- [[Hard rules create cognitive bias]]
