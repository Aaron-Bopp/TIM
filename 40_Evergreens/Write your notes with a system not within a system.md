#### [[Write your notes with a system not within a system]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Don't let yourself get bogged down with questions like, "Am I using the system the way the creator intended?" 
[[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]], let yourself find what works along the way. 

- [[Better tools allow us to be less disciplined and more productive]]
- [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]]
- [[Use philosophies as far they are useful and nothing more]]
