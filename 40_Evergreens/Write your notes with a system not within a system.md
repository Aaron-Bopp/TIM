#### [[Write your notes with a system not within a system]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Choosing a note writing system is choosing a system for thought]],
but [[Organization systems are not mutually exclusive]].
Don't let yourself get bogged down with questions like, "Am I using the system the way the creator intended?" 

These are your notes write them your way, 
and [[When in doubt, write what you think]].

1. [[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]], let yourself find what works along the way.  
1. [[Learning how systems work can be a gateway to creating thought]] so shop around and experiment.
1. [[A healthy second brain requires a surplus of entry points]] so don't feel like you have to find the "right" solution
1. [[Better tools allow us to be less disciplined and more productive]] so use your tools to your advantage and don't  stress about it.
1. [[Use philosophies as far they are useful and nothing more]]. You know what's best for your brain.
%% 1. [[Productivity tools are often most useful in how much work they inspire you to do]] %%
