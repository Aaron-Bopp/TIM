#### [[Karma is based in the law of cause and effect]] 

For every action, there is a reaction.
If we trace those reactions back we can find the actions that caused them, and if we look we can see that those actions were in themselves reactions.
Doing this, we can see why "everything happens for a reason."
That doesn't mean it's a good thing or that it was purposeful, but there was a cause for that effect.
This is principle is encapsulated in [[karma]].
If we do repeatedly do good things in our lives, they should have positive effects on our lives.
Of course, not everybody comes into life equal. 
Your position in life is based on your parent's position, where you are born, and what is happening in the world when you are born.
Everything that has ever happened has led to the situation of your birth.
That is why [[karma]] transfers across lifetimes.
