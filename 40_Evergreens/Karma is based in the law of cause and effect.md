#### [[Karma is based in the law of cause and effect]] 

For every action there is a reaction.
If we trace reactions back we can find the actions that caused them, and if we look we can see that those actions were in themselves reactions.
Doing this we can see why *everything happens for a reason*.
That doesn't mean it's a good thing or that is was purposeful, but there was a cause for that effect.
This is [[karma]] at it's core.
If we do repeatedly do good things in our lives, they should have positive affects on our lives.
Of course not everybody comes into life equal. 
That is why [[karma]] transfers across lifetimes.
^[[[articleKarma and Reincarnation in Hinduism]]]
