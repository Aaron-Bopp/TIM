The size of a concept grows and shrinks with our [[understanding]] of it, available [[information]], and the detail of note covering it. You will have [[conceptual notes]] that partially or completely encompass other notes, but serve as overview or outlines of that note and related others. Those larger scope notes are most valuable as entry points for yourself and for notes that are distantly related. The smaller scoped notes are excellent for expanding your understanding, and gradually linking in closely related notes.

This is core to how [[evergreen notes]] 
[[Evergreen notes should be updated over time|integrate knowledge]]
and 
[[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow|grow over time]].
You may start with a note that is broad, but as you understand more about the subject, you realize that something you covered with just a few sentences before is actually much more complex.
With [[conceptual notes]], you can easily take those sentences, refactor them into their own note, and have the revised reference in the original note. You could have just expanded that information into the current note, but now that information can be accessed elsewhere, and the parent note doesn't cover information outside its area.
