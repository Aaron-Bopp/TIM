#### [[Faith can be a useful tool for grounding yourself]] 

I think that [[religion]] can be a healthy way to avoid the uncertainty of not knowing the answer to [[The three main questions of life]] and can lead to a happy and fruitful life. Especially 
because:: [[Belief helps us push through hardship]].
This is 
part of:: [[My worldview is not about conversion it is about acceptance]], 
because I cannot ethically justify pushing against someone's [[faith]] when it isn't doing harm and is helping them.

However,
[[What are the blindspots of the Christian worldview|The Christian worldview causes blindspots]],
and there many reasons why the grounding aspect of faith may doing more harm than good.
It may be uncomfortable to question something that feels right and true,
but [[Fear cannot be a deterrent for deconstructing your faith]].
Just because something feels right does not mean it is right.
[[Sometimes we can't grow until we change our environment]] and if the comfortability of faith
is keeping you inside of a corrupt church or system you won't be able to grow.
^[This could be seen as an 
example of:: [[The way systems work can create cognitive bias]]
because the grounding aspect of faith might make you blind to biases it causes in you, i.e. "Why can't they just be a good person?", "How do they not understand that behavior is unacceptable" or [[Many Christians confuse not sinning for morality]]
