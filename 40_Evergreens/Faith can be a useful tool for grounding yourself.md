#### [[Faith can be a useful tool for grounding yourself]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

I think that [[religion]] can be a healthy way to avoid the uncertainty of not knowing the answer to [[The three main questions of life]] and can lead to a happy and fruitful life.

Prayer is basically [[meditation]] which has been shown to bring about supernatural experiences. ( #TO/DO/CITE )  

- [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]]
- [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]]
- [[Faith is an abstraction of cognitive dissonance]]
- [[We are confined to the tools of our time]]
