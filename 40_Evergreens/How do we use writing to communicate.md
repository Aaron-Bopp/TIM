#### [[How do we use writing to communicate]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Is writing just the symbols that represent [[language]] either partially ([[partial script]]) or fully ([[full script]])?

[[Math is it's own language]], is it only [[writing]] or is it more?

explains:: [[The Inca empire was maintained without a full script writing system]]
