#### [[A repressed identity creates a mistrust of self-love and self-esteem]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

#TO/TEND/WATER note
[[A secure identity is the best defense against social anxiety]],
but a [[repressed]] [[identity]] can lead to a variety of problems,
including struggling to understand where your [[emotions]] are coming from and why.
^[[[Overly interrogative parents can lead to alexithymic children]]]
If you don't understand who you are, you will struggle to understand why certain things make you feel good and certain things make you feel bad.
This leads to [[social anxiety]] as you will be spending so much time trying to figure out *why* you're feeling so anxious that you won't be able to live in the moment
^[[[Anxiety prevents us from living in the present]]]
The reason you can't pinpoint your [[anxiety]] is that
[[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]]
and [[Our brain actively inhibits us from processing repressed emotions]]

[[A secure identity is the best defense against social anxiety]], but it can be hard to actually develop a secure [[identity]] because
[[Social anxiety is a feedback loop]].

- [[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]]
- [[Presentation is the realization of our self-perception and identity is the realization of our self-image]]
- [[A inwardly judgmental and outwardly accepting home creates trust issues]]
