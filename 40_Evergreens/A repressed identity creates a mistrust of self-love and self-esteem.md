#### [[A repressed identity creates a mistrust of self-love and self-esteem]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

If you don't understand who you are, you will stuggle to understand why certain things make you feel good and certain things make you feel bad. This leads to [[social anxiety]] as you can pinpoint the reasons behind your [[anxiety]]: [[A secure identity is the best defense against social anxiety]]

[[Presentation is the realization of our self-perception and identity is the realization of our self-image]], but if you have a repressed identity, you don't have an accurate [[self-image]] to realize: [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do#Cause repressed identity]]

- [[A inwardly judgmental and outwardly accepting home creates trust issues]]
- [[A secure identity is the best defense against social anxiety]]
	- [[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]]
		- [[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]]
