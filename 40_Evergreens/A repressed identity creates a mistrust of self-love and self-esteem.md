#### [[A repressed identity creates a mistrust of self-love and self-esteem]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[A secure identity is the best defense against social anxiety]],
but a [[repressed]] [[identity]] can lead to a variety of problems,
including struggling to understand where your [[emotions]] are coming from and why.
If you don't understand who you are, you will struggle to understand why certain things make you feel good and certain things make you feel bad.
This leads to [[social anxiety]] as you will be spending so much time trying to figure out *why* you're feeling so anxious that you won't be able to live in the moment
^[[[Anxiety prevents us from living in the present]]]
The reason you can't pinpoint your [[anxiety]] is that
[[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]]
and [[Our brain actively inhibits us from processing repressed emotions]]

[[A secure identity is the best defense against social anxiety]], but it can be hard to actually develop a secure [[identity]] because
[[Social anxiety is a feedback loop]].

- [[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]]
- [[Presentation is the realization of our self-perception and identity is the realization of our self-image]]
- [[A inwardly judgmental and outwardly accepting home creates trust issues]]
