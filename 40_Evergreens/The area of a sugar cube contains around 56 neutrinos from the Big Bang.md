#### [[The area of a sugar cube contains around 56 neutrinos from the Big Bang]] 

Of course there are billions of neutrinos flowing through us at any moment, but just like the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], there are [[neutrinos]] around us from the very beginning of [[the Big Bang]]. The [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] was [[photons]] that were then cooled to about 3 Kelvin as they spread out and were absorbed, but [[neutrinos]] didn't interact with hardly anything, and were cooled to about 2 Kelvin.
