#### [[Worldviews should not make life seem easy and simple]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[You will never be pushed to understand marginalization unless you are part of a marginalized group]].
If a [[worldview]] makes life seem easy, it will shape the way you view people who are struggling.
The pursuit of [[self-actualization]] is different for every person, but if you aren't part of a [[marginalization|marginalized]] group and your [[worldview]] tells you that all you need to do is one simple thing, you will view those people as lazy or wrong.

This is especially seen in [[individualism|individualistic]] cultures like [[America]], and in worldviews that are focused on salvation and not [[self-improvement]] ([[Christianity]]): [[The actual path to being a good person isn't explored by Evangelicalism]]

#TO/TEND/GRAFT 
- [[Worldviews should be open ended and adaptive]]
- [[Be the change you want to see in the world]]
