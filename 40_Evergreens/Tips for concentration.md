#### [[Tips for concentration]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Concentration is something that is required to most things done in today's society. Many things can cause a lack of concentration ranging from simple distraction to serious illness's like [[depression]] and [[neurodiversity]] like [[ADHD]]. Here some ways that I have found to help concentrate

1. Interact with what you are trying to understand in more than one way. 
	- If you are reading: write notes/highlight, and/or have it read aloud while you read. 
	- If you are doing something, talk out loud what you are doing and how, in programming its called rubber duck debugging, but it can help you stay involved and notice problems. 
2. Eliminate distractions and make the only thing you do in your workspace work. If you work at an office this is easy, but if you work from home it can be as much as moving your monitor to the other side of you desk after work or working in one room and doing leisure in the other.
3. Be willing to give yourself breaks, but try to do activities that will rest your brain instead of stimulate it. I.E go for a walk  or meditate instead of looking at social [[media]] for 20 mins.
4. If it's possible and your lack of concentration is common reach out to your doctor to see if you can get a diagnosis and medication would help. For some, medication is the tool they need to survive and for others it is jumping off point for better habits.
5. Look into [[mindfullness]] and [[meditation]]. It's okay to get frustrated and upset, but practices likes those help
