#### [[Tips for concentration]] 

Concentration is limited resource in the modern world. Cause for lack of concentration range from simple distraction, to illness's like [[depression]], to [[neurodiversity|neurodiverse]] minds.
^[[[ADHD is not a lack of attention it is a misplacement of attention]]]

Here some ways that I have found to help concentrate:
1. Interact with what you are trying to understand in more than one way. 
	- If you are reading: write notes/highlight, and/or have it read aloud while you read. 
	- If you are doing something, talk out loud what you are doing and how, in programming its called [[rubber duck debugging]], but it can help you stay involved and notice problems. 
2. Eliminate distractions and make the only thing you do in your workspace work. If you work at an office this is easy, but if you work from home it can be as much as moving your monitor to the other side of you desk after work or working in one room and doing leisure in the other.
3. Be willing to give yourself breaks, but try to do activities that will rest your brain instead of stimulate it. I.E go for a walk  or meditate instead of looking at social [[media]] for 20 mins.
4. If it's possible and your lack of concentration is common reach out to your doctor to see if you can get a diagnosis and medication would help. For some, [[medication]] is the tool they need to survive and for others it is jumping off point for better habits.
6. Find tools that reduce [[friction]] thus reducing required concentration, e.g. [[spaced repetition]]: [[Friction is a hindrance to learning]]
7. Understand how your brain works and try to work with it: [[Neurodiverse people can use their brain to their advantage]]
