#### [[Faith is an abstraction of cognitive dissonance]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Christian's use faith as a shield to protect themselves from the horrors of the real world, and of their own creation. You cannot fully blame them for this, as our brains are not really built to handle a world that is this painful or to think far enough ahead to understand the full extent of our actions. We are built to believe in something better: [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]]

- [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]]
- [[The brain is powerful enough to create supernatural experiences]]
- [[Q justifies conservatives discontent]] new form of this
- [[The Politicization of the Christian Church]]
- [[Christians struggle to feel empathy because they must believe that non-christians are going to hell]]
