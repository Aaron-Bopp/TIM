#### [[Faith is an abstraction of cognitive dissonance]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Just like [[Faith can be a useful tool for grounding yourself]] because it answers [[The three main questions of life]], it also abstracts the [[cognitive dissonance]] of life by answering them.

Christian's use faith as a shield to protect themselves from the horrors of the real world, and of their own creation.
^[[[The Politicization of the Christian Church]]] 
You cannot fully [[blame]] them for this, as our brains are not really built to handle a world that is this painful or to think far enough ahead to understand the full extent of our actions. We are built to believe in something better: [[Humans have decided to reject an unjust world]]

- [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]] #TO/TEND/GRAFT 
	- [[The brain is powerful enough to create supernatural experiences]]
	- [[Is cognitive dissonance the reason for harmful behaviors]]
	- [[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]]
- [[The Politicization of the Christian Church]]
	- [[Q justifies conservatives discontent]] new form of this
- [[Christians struggle to feel empathy because they must believe that non-christians are going to hell]]

- [[The Christian worldview is incompatible with most other worldviews]]

##### Counter:: [[faith]] is no longer enough to satisfy people's [[cognitive dissonance]]

![[The church will fail if christians keep aligning themselves with hate instead of love#^128168]]
