#### [[Faith is an abstraction of cognitive dissonance]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

- causes [[Humans are addicted to believing]]

"Be in the world not of the world because if you are of the world you start believing worldly things like evolution and that people who don't believe the same thing as me aren't inherently inferior." This is just a sample of the kind of things you are expected to believe in the church. Yet [[Christianity]] gets away with asking it's practitioners to repeatedly go against the world because of one simple thing: [[faith]].

"Have faith and you will be saved." This is the thing a Christian's eternal destiny relies on, and if their [[faith]] wavers, it is no ones fault but their own. This pushes Christian's into living with this [[cognitive dissonance]] %%What is "this cognitive dissonance? %% and contributes to [[The Christian worldview is incompatible with most other worldviews]]

%%
#TO/WRITE something about how we are born into this world not knowing anything, and are repeatedly told that everything has a meaning when it doesn't unless we give it a meaning
The cognitive dissonance is that there is a loving god that has created this world, but the world we live in is unjust. 
%%

[[Faith can be a useful tool for grounding yourself]] because it answers [[The three main questions of life]], and in doing so it ignores the [[What is the cognitive effect of living in an unjust world|The cognitive effect of living in an unjust world]].
^[This is why [[Christians struggle to feel empathy because they must believe that non-christians are going to hell]], because believers and non-believers have fundamentally different ways of thinking about the world.]

Christian's use faith as a shield to protect themselves from the horrors of the real world, and of their own creation.
^[[[The Politicization of the Christian Church]]] 
You cannot fully [[blame]] them for this, as our brains are not really built to handle a world that is this painful or to think far enough ahead to understand the full extent of our actions.
^[[[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things]]]
 We are built to believe in something better: [[Humans have decided to reject an unjust world]]

This has been built into our psyche for millennia
^[Which means this trait is something that is selected for because [[Humans are a product of evolution]]]
and is one of the reasons behind why the [[The brain is powerful enough to create supernatural experiences]]. Our brain created these stories to help us understand the thunder and lightning, push ourselves to survive, and to find meaning after we have lost loved ones. In a way this is similar to how [[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]], as our sense that we are have meaning and purpose as humans, helps protect us.

##### Counter:: [[faith]] is no longer enough to satisfy people's [[cognitive dissonance]]

#TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH  does the rise in access to information through the internet impact [[belief systems]] and [[Christianity]], with the [[Rise of Conspiracy Culture]], people are turning to conspiracies instead of [[faith]] to satisfy their [[cognitive dissonance]], [[Q justifies conservatives discontent]], [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]] ^128168
