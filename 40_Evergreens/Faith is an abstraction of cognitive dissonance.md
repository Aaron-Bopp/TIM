#### [[Faith is an abstraction of cognitive dissonance]] 

> [!summary]
> 
>  An [[abstraction]] is a way to remove complexity of operation without losing functionality. 
>  For example, a coffee maker removes the complexity of heating and distributing water at just the right temperature, without you doing it manually, while still making a good cup of coffee.
>  [[Faith]] removes the complexity of having to contrast your [[religious belief]] with contradictory evidence, without having to go through the stress of [[cognitive dissonance]], while still reconciling those ideas into your [[worldview]].

"Be in the world not of the world," because if you are of the world you start believing worldly things like [[evolution]] and that people who don't believe the same thing as you aren't inherently inferior. 
[[Christianity]] expects you to accept that your [[worldview]] doesn't line up with the facts of your everyday existence. This creates [[cognitive dissonance]] as your understanding of the teachings of [[Christianity]] clash with your understanding of the world.

"Have faith and you will be saved," is the [[belief]] a Christian's eternal destiny relies on, and if their [[faith]] wavers, it is no one's fault but their own. What other choice do Christian's have but to live with their [[cognitive dissonance]], lest their eternal [[salvation]] be jeopardized.
Of course, this is an impossible situation to be in. 
Most Christian's will put lots of energy into either ignoring the state of the world as sinful or non-existent, or by crafting [[rationalizations]] that balance their Christian and worldly beliefs.

Christian's use faith as a shield to protect themselves from the horrors of the real world, and of their own creation.
^[[[The Politicization of the Christian Church]]] 
You cannot fully [[blame]] them for this, as our brains are not really built to handle a world that is this painful or to think far enough ahead to understand the full extent of our actions.
^[[[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things]]]
We are built to believe in something better: [[Humans have decided to reject an unjust world]]

This trait is 
part of:: [[What are the blindspots of the Christian worldview]]

This has been built into our psyche for millennia.
^[Which means this trait is something that is selected for because [[Humans are a product of evolution]].
This has lead to a variety of scientific views of religion, including [[Religion as a rational bid for supernatural reward]]
and [[Religion as a group level adaptation]]. ]
Our brain created these stories to help us understand the thunder and lightning, push ourselves to survive, and to find meaning after we have lost loved ones. 
[[The brain is powerful enough to create supernatural experiences]]

%% #TO/TEND/MULCH 
#TO/PONDER/IDEA something about how we are born into this world not knowing anything, and are repeatedly told that everything has a meaning when it doesn't unless we give it a meaning
The cognitive dissonance is that there is a loving god that has created this world, but the world we live in is unjust. 
[[The ego is the brain's response to the realization that we are just another individual in the world]]

[[Faith can be a useful tool for grounding yourself]] because it answers [[The three main questions of life]], but in doing so it ignores the [[What is the cognitive effect of living in an unjust world|The cognitive effect of living in an unjust world]].
^[This is why [[Christians struggle to feel empathy because they must believe that non-christians are going to hell]], because believers and non-believers have fundamentally different ways of thinking about the world.]

##### Counter:: [[faith]] is no longer enough to satisfy people's [[cognitive dissonance]]

#TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH  does the rise in access to information through the internet impact [[belief systems]] and [[Christianity]], with the [[Rise of Conspiracy Culture]], people are turning to conspiracies instead of [[faith]] to satisfy their [[cognitive dissonance]], [[Q justifies conservatives discontent]], [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]] ^128168
