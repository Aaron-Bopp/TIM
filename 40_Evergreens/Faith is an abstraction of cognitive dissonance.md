#### [[Faith is an abstraction of cognitive dissonance]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`


"Be in the world not of the world because if you are of the world you start believing worldly things like evolution and that people who don't believe the same thing as me aren't inherently inferior"
#TO/WRITE something about how we are born into this world not knowing anything, and are repeatedly told that everything has a meaning when it doesn't unless we give it a meaning
The cognitive dissonance is that there is a loving god that has created this world, but the world we live in is unjust. 

[[Faith can be a useful tool for grounding yourself]] because it answers [[The three main questions of life]], and in doing so it ignores the [[What is the cognitive effect of living in an unjust world|The cognitive effect of living in an unjust world]]


Christian's use faith as a shield to protect themselves from the horrors of the real world, and of their own creation.
^[[[The Politicization of the Christian Church]]] 
You cannot fully [[blame]] them for this, as our brains are not really built to handle a world that is this painful or to think far enough ahead to understand the full extent of our actions. We are built to believe in something better: [[Humans have decided to reject an unjust world]]

- [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]] #TO/TEND/GRAFT 
	- [[The brain is powerful enough to create supernatural experiences]]
	- [[Is cognitive dissonance the reason for harmful behaviors]]
	- [[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]]
- [[The Politicization of the Christian Church]]
	- [[Q justifies conservatives discontent]] new form of this
- [[Christians struggle to feel empathy because they must believe that non-christians are going to hell]]

- [[The Christian worldview is incompatible with most other worldviews]]

##### Counter:: [[faith]] is no longer enough to satisfy people's [[cognitive dissonance]]

#TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH  does the rise in access to information through the internet impact [[belief systems]] and [[Christianity]], with the [[Rise of Conspiracy Culture]], people are turning to conspiracies instead of [[faith]] to satisfy their [[cognitive dissonance]], [[Q justifies conservatives discontent]], [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]] ^128168
