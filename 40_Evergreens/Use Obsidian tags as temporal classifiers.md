#### [[Use Obsidian tags as temporal classifiers]] 

In [[Obsidian (software)|Obsidian]] tags are a piece of metadata that you can add to a note, [^1] and when clicked they open a search box with the appropriate search query. You cannot add any [[markdown]] or metadata to them, which makes them much less powerful than notes, but they can still be very valuable in your [[knowledge management|knowledge management system]]. 
^[The [[Tag Wrangler (plugin, obsidian)]] plugin has added support for tag pages, which would alleviate some of these downsides, but would likely not synergize well with this use of tags]
You can make hierarchies of tags, which allows for groups of similar tags to be placed together. This way, you can group related ideas, without having to push them into one specific category.
^[[[Only categorize as much as your data requires]]]

[^1]: [[Deleting a note in a web of thought can have unforeseen consequences]]

While the nesting of tags can help to provide structure to what notes are about, I don't like them to describe what the note covers. [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]], and applying a hierarchical tag structure to them would inhibit this.
^[[[Webs of thought provide heterarchical structure]]]
This is why I use tags as **temporal classifiers,** meaning that they apply a temporary classification to a note. This is the idea behind my [[my TO(DO) and EVER(GREEN) structure]].

##### Temporary metadata is an entry point to your [[second brain]]

Temporary metadata allows us to enter into our notes in a dynamic way. Whether it be status' that will change as notes grow, or work items that can be added and removed, interacting with the metadata will help us improve our notes.

This means that they can be used in combination with other metadata, such as note modified time. If I search for my \#TO tags and sort by ascending time I can see the most recent things I needed to do, and if I sort by descending time I can see the things I've procrastinated the longest. While tags are not directly connected to modified time (I can modify a note without removing the tag), it does mean I have seen that note recently and thus have seen that tag. This is just another way of interacting with your [[second brain]]:
[[A healthy second brain requires a surplus of entry points]]

##### Classifications group notes with similar metadata

Every piece of thought in my [[second brain]] is tagged with #node. This includes my [[source notes]], [[topic notes]], and of course [[evergreen notes]], but it does not include anything in my 00_Meta and 20_Entry folders. This is because those folders are purely to help [[My TIM]] function, and to help other people access it. I exclude these notes from this tag, because they are artificial connections that do not help me create thought. 

Having this tag means that I can access every piece of thought that is helpful to my learning easily and quickly, and will not have to deal with any other things clogging up my searches, backlinks, or [[Dataview]] queries.

I can use the sublevels of this tag to classify how a note is useful to me, and these become very powerful through the use of various plugins. Tags can be used as the parameter for a [[Dataview]] search, which means that you don't need to store all notes of a certain in a folder. They can also be used with plugins like [[Spaced Repetition (plugin)]] to allow you to review all or your \#evergreen notes. This is why I include tags in all of my major note templates. These classifications do not have to be related to what the note is about, but rather describe the metadata of the note: [[Note structures should help curate knowledge]]

##### Counterpoint:: Tags can provide organization of ideas 

If tags can be classifiers of types of notes, why can't they be classifiers of the ideas of notes? [[Information]] can certainly be classified, and because multiple tags can be added, if an idea spans multiple content areas you can just add more tags. There's excellent discussion of this here: [A Guide On Links vs. Tabs In Obsidian - Knowledge management - Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/a-guide-on-links-vs-tabs-in-obsidian/28231)

While I think there is benefit to organization, I think that notes accomplish this better than tags in [[Obsidian (software)|Obsidian]].
