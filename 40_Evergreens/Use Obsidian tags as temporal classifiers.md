#### [[Use Obsidian tags as temporal classifiers]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

In [[Obsidian (software)|Obsidian]] tags are a piece of metadata that you can add to a note, [^1] and when clicked open a search box with the appropriate search query. You cannot add any markdown or metadata to them, which makes them much less powerful than notes, but they can still be very valuable in your [[knowledge management|knowledge management system]]. You can make hierarchies of tags, which allows for groups of similar tags to be placed together. This way, you can group related ideas, without having to push them into one specific category.

While the nesting of tags can help to provide structure to what notes are, I don't like them to describe what the idea of a note is. [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]], and applying a hierarchical tag structure to them would inhibit this.
^[[[Webs of thought provide heterarchical structure]]]
This is why I use tags as **temporal classifiers,** meaning that they apply a temporary classification to a note. This is the idea behind my [[my TO(DO) and EVER(GREEN) structure]].

##### Temporary metadata is an entry point to your second brain

Temporal just means that when I create tags, I do so knowing that I will eventually change or remove them. This means that they describe some current aspect of the note, that may change over time, and I can use the tag to group notes that have that aspect.

This means that they can be used in combination with other metadata, such as note modified time. If I search for \#TO tags and sort by ascending time I can see the most recent things I needed to do, and if I sort by descending time I can see the things I've procrastinated the longest. While tags are not directly connected to modified time (I can modify a note without removing the tag), it does mean I have seen that note recently and thus have seen that tag. This is just another way of interacting with your [[second brain]]: [[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge]]

##### Classifications group notes with similar metadata

Every piece of thought in my [[second brain]] is tagged with #node. This includes my [[source notes]], [[topic note|topic notes]], and of course [[evergreen notes]], but it does not include anything in my 00_Meta and 20_Entry folders. This is because those folders are purely to help [[My TIM]] function, and to help other people access it. I exclude these notes from this tag, because they are artificial connections that do not help me create thought. 
^[[[Your second brain should be an inspirational hub of creativity]]]
Having this tag means that I can access every piece of thought that is helpful to my learning easily and quickly, and will not have to deal with any other things clogging up my searches, backlinks, or [[Dataview]] queries.

I can use the sublevels of this tag to classify how a note is useful to me, and these become very powerful through the use of various plugins. Tags can be used as the parameter for a [[Dataview]] search, which means that you don't need to store all notes of a certain in a folder. They can also be used with plugins like [[Spaced Repetition (plugin)]] to allow you to review all or your \#evergreen notes. This is why I include tags in all of my major note templates. These classifications do not have to be related to what the note is about, but rather describe the metadata of the note: [[Nodes in the second brain are made up of impermanent data and permanent metadata]]

##### Counter:: Tags can provide organization of ideas 

If tags can be classifiers of types of notes, why can't they be classifiers of the ideas of notes? Information can certainly be classified, and because multiple tags can be added, if an idea spans multiple content areas you can just add more tags. There's excellent discussion of this here: [A Guide On Links vs. Tabs In Obsidian - Knowledge management - Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/a-guide-on-links-vs-tabs-in-obsidian/28231)

While I think there is benefit to organization, I think that notes accomplish this better than tags in [[Obsidian (software)|Obsidian]]:
- [[Prioritize organization over categorization]]
- [[Stub notes are data structures for implicit knowledge gathering]]
- [[Organization systems are not mutually exclusive]]
- [[Only organize as much as your data requires]]
