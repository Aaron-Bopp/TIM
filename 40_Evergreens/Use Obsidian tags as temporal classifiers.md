#### [[Use Obsidian tags as temporal classifiers]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

In [[Obsidian (software)|Obsidian]] tags are a peice of metadata that you can add to a note, [^1] and functionally do little more than open a search box with the appropriate search query. You cannot add any markdown or metadata to them, which makes them much less powerful than links and notes, but they can still be very valuable in your [[knowledge management|knowledge management system]].  You can make hierarchies of tags, which allows for groups of similar tags to be placed together. The way you can group related ideas, without having to push them into the same folder: [[Prioritize organization over categorization to avoid wasted energy]]. 
[^1]: [[Nodes in the second brain are made up of impermanent data and permanent metadata]]

While the nesting of tags can help to provide structure to what notes are, I don't like them what the idea of a note is. [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]], and applying a hierarchical tag structure to them would inhibit this. This is why I use tags as **temporal classifiers,** meaning that they apply a temporary 

Tags become much more powerful through the use of various plugins. Tags can be used as the parameter for a [[Dataview]] search, which means that you don't need to store all notes of a certain in a folder. They can also be used with plugins like [[Spaced Repetition (plugin)]] to allow you to review all or your \#evergreen notes. This is why I usually include tags in all of my major note templates ([[Note taxonomy]])
