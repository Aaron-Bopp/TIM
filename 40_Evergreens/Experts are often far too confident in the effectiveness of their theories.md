#### [[Experts are often far too confident in the effectiveness of their theories]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Many would say that [[Evolution]] is the greatest idea ever invented,
due to the many complex systems in has described.
[[Computer Science]] has revolutionized the world in ways we are still [[understanding]], 
and is probably to most powerful tool that has ever been created.
So it would be easy to take your understanding of these incredibly powerful things,
and try to use them to solve everything, as they have already solved so much.

Unfortunately, this usually leads to disaster.

It's not uncommon for a widely respected expert in one field, to try and take their skills to another and totally fail. 
Just because you can understand one incredibly complex thing, does not mean that you can understand another without doing all of the ground work.
This seems to be the most common in the areas with best tools,
^[Perhaps this is 
contrasts:: [[Better tools allow us to be less disciplined and more productive]]
]
but likely happens anywhere there are incredibly complex things.
Obviously, most people at the upper echelons of these fields are happy to stay in their lane,
but many will try and graft their solutions onto problems in other areas.
