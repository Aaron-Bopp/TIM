#### [[Experts are often far too confident in the effectiveness of their theories]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Many would say that [[Evolution]] is the greatest idea ever invented,
due to the many complex systems it has described.
[[Computer Science]] has revolutionized the world in ways we are still [[understanding]], 
and is probably the most powerful tool that has ever been created.
So it would be easy to take your [[understanding]] of these incredibly powerful things,
and try to use them to solve other problems, as they have already solved so much.

Unfortunately, this usually leads to disaster.
^[Perhaps this false [[confidence]] is more likely to occur in really powerful tools, which would mean it 
contrasts:: [[Better tools allow us to be less disciplined and more productive]]

[[Crypto currency]] is an excellent example of this. While understanding the [[Blockchain]] and being able to create a [[Crypto currency]] involves quite a bit of [[knowledge]], none of that knowledge is a solid [[understanding]] of [[economy|Economics]], [[climate change]], or just human nature. The quote above is referring to the unfortunately common trait of computer scientists to assume that they can solve any problem with code.

This idea is also heavily explored in [[course_Human Behavioral Biology|Human Behavioral Biology]], which is a course that explores how many of the hard sciences claim to be able to explain [[human behavior]], but constantly contradict eachother. This trait is behind the creation of [[Lobotomy]], [[Eugenics]], and many other things that we would like to forget.
