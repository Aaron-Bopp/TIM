#### [[Be the change you want to see in the world]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

If you want to see change in the world it is not enough to stand by and [[hope]] for better times,
because:: [[Hope is not optimism it is a practice for producing change]].
If you have [[Humans have decided to reject an unjust world|decided to reject an unjust world]],
you need to take part in it.

With:: [[Knowledge of an unjust world is painful|knowledge that the world is unjust]]
it can be easy to fall into [[Sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion]], 
but we need to take part in [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]]

On a personal level this 
includes:: [[How to pursue the positive things in life]]
and on a societal level this 
includes:: [[How do we effect change in society]]

This is possibly an 
answer to:: [[What is the cognitive effect of living in an unjust world]]

%%
[[Christianity|christian]]s are surprisingly good at this because of [[Christians struggle to feel empathy because they must believe that non-christians are going to hell]] #TO/PONDER/SOCIETY is this because they have more capacity to push through [[cognitive dissonance]]: [[Is cognitive dissonance the reason for harmful behaviors]]
- %%
