#### [[Everybody can't be a capitalist]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

One of the successes of the [[Rise of Modern Conservatism]] is to have convinced [[Conservatism|Conservatives]] that capitalism works for the working class by demonizing [[Communism]] and shifting the [[overton window]] so far right: [[McCarthyism is an attack on totalitarianism not communism]] 

[[Ronald Reagan invented modern conservatism]], and claimed to support [[supply-side economics]], but eventually had to use much more [[progressive]] legislation to stop [[economy|economic]] problems during his terms: [[Republican voters do not hold their leaders accountable]]
