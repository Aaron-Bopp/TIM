#### [[Capitalism runs on class division]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Capitalism]] cannot function unless the people are separated into a class of workers and class of owners. 
Said another way,
[[Capitalism]] would fail if everyone was a capitalist. 

One of the successes of the [[Rise of Modern Conservatism]] is to have convinced [[Conservatism|Conservatives]] that [[capitalism]] works for the working class.
[[McCarthyism is an attack on totalitarianism not communism]], 
but demonizing [[Communism]] works. 
Over the past sixty years Conservatives have been largely successful in shifting the [[Overton window]] right enough that [[Conservatism states that conspiracy is more believable that cooperation|conspiracy is more believable that cooperation]].

#TO/TEND/MULCH 
[[Ronald Reagan invented modern conservatism]], and claimed to support [[supply-side economics]], but eventually had to use much more [[progressive]] legislation to stop [[economy|economic]] problems during his terms in order to support the [[middle class]].
It doesn't matter that he did the opposite of what ran on,
[[Republican voters do not hold their leaders accountable]],
so he was allowed to get by on good looks and [[the culture war]].
