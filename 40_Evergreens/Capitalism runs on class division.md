#### [[Capitalism runs on class division]] 

[[Capitalism]] cannot function unless the people are separated into a class of workers and class of owners. 
Said another way,
[[Capitalism]] would fail if everyone was a capitalist. 

One of the successes of the [[Rise of Modern Conservatism]] is to have convinced [[Conservatism|Conservatives]] that [[capitalism]] works for the working class.
[[McCarthyism is an attack on totalitarianism not communism]], 
but demonizing [[Communism]] works. 
Over the past sixty years Conservatives have been largely successful in shifting the [[Overton window]] right enough that [[Conservatism states that conspiracy is more believable that cooperation|conspiracy is more believable that cooperation]].

[[Ronald Reagan invented modern conservatism]], and claimed to support [[supply-side economics]], but eventually [[Anti-government stances lead to economic crashes]] and Regan had to up government spending to support the [[middle class]].
In spite of this, the myth of "trickle-down [[economics]]" continued for years, 
because [[Republican voters do not hold their leaders accountable]].
