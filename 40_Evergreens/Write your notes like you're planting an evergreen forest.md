#### [[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Fear is the number one hindrance to trying]], so [[When in doubt, write what you think]].

You don't need to know how to cut down a forest when you start spreading seeds. You will strike a balance between the stress of having an unorganized system and the stress of having to design your system. [^1]  All you need to start an evergreen forest is seeds, and a place to plant them. You do not need to fully understand the system when you start planting the forest. An evergreen can grow in a field of bushes as long as the ground is fertile: [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]] 

[^1]: [[Prioritize organization over categorization to avoid wasted energy]]

That being said, if you don't know what an evergreen forest looks like you don't know which kind of seeds to plant and how to foster them. Having an unattended forest can be very overwhelming, but it can also provide the knowledge and context you need in order to choose the correct system Looking to examples and mentors is key in building a [[knowledge management|personal knowledge system]] because [[Learning how systems work can be a gateway to creating thought]]. Making a elaborate system can be fun it can also distract you from your work,[^4] but [[Choosing a note writing system is choosing a system for thought]]

[^4]: [[Powerful tools make dangerous toys]]

If you spend to much time is a system that won't be able to flourish in to an evergreen forest, you will be reluctant to switch: [[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]]
