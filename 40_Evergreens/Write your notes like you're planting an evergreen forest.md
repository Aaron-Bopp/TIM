#### [[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Knowledge changes over time and so do we, so why do we expect our notes to stay the same forever. It is impossible to know everything about anything, so how can we expect that of ourselves when we are writing. If you want to have a [[knowledge management|knowledge management system]] full of complex thought, you need to start with the seeds. 
[[Fear is the number one hindrance to trying]] so 
[[When in doubt, write what you think]] and
soon you will have a forest of knowledge at your fingertips.

If you want my advice, start with [[evergreen notes]],
because [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]].
Previous writing is just fertilizer for evergreen notes,
and writing evergreen notes is just practice for future thought. 

However, if you don't know what an evergreen forest looks like, you don't know which kind of seeds to plant and how to foster them.
Having an unattended forest can be very overwhelming,
but it can also provide the [[knowledge]] and context you need in order to choose the correct system.
This is why
looking to examples and mentors is key in building a [[knowledge management|personal knowledge system]],
because [[Choosing a note writing system is choosing a system for thought]].

You will need to strike a balance between the stress of having an unorganized system 
and the stress of having to design your system.
While [[Learning how systems work can be a gateway to creating thought]],
making too elaborate system can distract you from your work.
^[[[Powerful tools make dangerous toys]]]
As you are building your [[systems for thought]] remember that 
[[Organization systems are not mutually exclusive]] 
and to 
[[Write your notes with a system not within a system]]

You don't need to know how to cut down a forest when you start spreading seeds, 
but if you spend too much time is a system that won't be able to flourish into an evergreen forest, you will be reluctant to switch: [[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]]

Entering the world of [[knowledge management]] can be a very intimidating thing,
but you will soon be drawn into the world and be surprised at how fast you are learning:
[[Communities are knowledge graphs]]
