#### [[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

You don't need to know how to cut down a forest when you start spreading seeds. 
[[Fear is the number one hindrance to trying]], so [[When in doubt, write what you think]].

Entering the world of [[knowledge management]] can be a very intimidating thing,
but you will soon be drawn into the world and be surprised at how fast you are learning.
^[[[Communities are knowledge graphs]]]
You will strike a balance between the stress of having an unorganized system 
and the stress of having to design your system, [^2]
and soon you will have a forest of knowledge at your fingertips.

[^1]: [[Communities are knowledge graphs]]
[^2]: [[Prioritize organization over categorization to avoid wasted energy]]

However, if you don't know what an evergreen forest looks like you don't know which kind of seeds to plant and how to foster them.
Having an unattended forest can be very overwhelming,
but it can also provide the knowledge and context you need in order to choose the correct system
Looking to examples and mentors is key in building a [[knowledge management|personal knowledge system]],
because [[Learning how systems work can be a gateway to creating thought]].
Making an elaborate system can be fun it can also distract you from your work,[^3]
but [[Choosing a note writing system is choosing a system for thought]]

[^3]: [[Powerful tools make dangerous toys]]

If you want my advice, start with [[evergreen notes]]:
[[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]] 
 If you have a seed, plant it and let it grow. Often times an imperative, descriptive title and backlinks are all note needs to have longevity, other time you may need to a sentence or two of context so that you don't forget what you were thinking.
 
If you spend too much time is a system that won't be able to flourish into an evergreen forest, you will be reluctant to switch: [[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]]
