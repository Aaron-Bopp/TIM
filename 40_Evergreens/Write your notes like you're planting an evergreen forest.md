#### [[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]] 

> [!summary]
> 
> Don't focus too hard on whether a piece of information is evergreen or not. Record the insights that seem valuable, and time will tell what is really useful. On the flip side, think about what coming across these notes will be like in months or years. Don't take things for granted just because they are obvious to you now.

You don't need to know how to cut down a forest when you start spreading seeds.
It can often be intimidating to start a [[note writing]] practice,
but in the end there are no rules, and you won't find what works for you until you try.

Having an unattended forest can be very overwhelming,
but it can also provide the [[knowledge]] and context you need in order to choose the correct system.
Looking to examples and mentors is key in building a [[knowledge management|personal knowledge system]],
because [[Learning how systems work can be a gateway to creating thought]].

You will need to strike a balance between the stress of having an unorganized system 
and the stress of having to design your system.
While [[Choosing a note writing system is choosing a system for thought]],
but spending too much time on an elaborate system can distract you from your work.
As you are building your [[second brain]],
[[Prioritize understanding over organization or categorization]]
and even more importantly
[[Write your notes with a system not within a system]].
Soon you will be drawn into the world and be surprised at how fast you are [[learning]]
because [[Communities are knowledge graphs]].
