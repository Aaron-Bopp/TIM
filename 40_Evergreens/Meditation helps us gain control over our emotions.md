#### [[Meditation helps us gain control over our emotions]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Meditation is a practice to gain control over your thoughts]], but it also deals directly with the systems that govern our [[emotions]].

[[Meditation regulates your hormones and stress physiology]], allowing us to reduce the effects of these primal [[defense-mechanisms]].
Additionally, [[Meditation helps us regulate our nervous system]] 
so we can be in better control of how we respond to begin with.
Finally, [[Meditation helps us detach negative attachments]]
so we can heal past engagements that our [[brain]] has decided are unforgettable.

This is 
part of::[[Meditation improves mental, physical, and emotional health]]
