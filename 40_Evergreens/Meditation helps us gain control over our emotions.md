#### [[Meditation helps us gain control over our emotions]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Meditation is a practice to gain control over your thoughts]], but it also deals directly with the systems that govern our emotions.

The reason that certain [[meditation]] styles work for different people lies in the differences between our brains. 
If your [[limbic system]] is failing to regulate your [[emotions]], [[meditation]] can help your [[Frontal Lobe|Frontal Lobes]] to gain [[control]].
^[[[notes_Science of Meditation]]]

[[Complex emotions are imperfect understandings of primal urges]]. 
We still carry many of the mechanisms that make it so [[Our brains are built around survival]].
This is where the physical aspects of [[meditation]] come in.
[[Meditation regulates your hormones and stress physiology]], allowing us to reduce the effects of these primal [[defense-mechanisms]].
Additionally, [[Meditation helps us regulate our nervous system]] 
so we can be in better control of how we respond to begin with.
Finally, [[Meditation helps us detach negative attachments]]
so we can heal past engagements that our [[brain]] has decided are unforgettable.
