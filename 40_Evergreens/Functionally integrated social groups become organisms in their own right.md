This requires a liberal use of the word social and strong understanding of the functional arrangement.
One example given is that of chromosomes. 
The genes that are stored on the chromosomes are physically inseparable from each other forcing them to replicate as a unit. This allows the process of [[natural selection]] to take place at a higher level (no longer among genes but among cells).
