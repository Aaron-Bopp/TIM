#### [[How to balance investment]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Investment is a balance of risk vs access. Long-term accounts like [[401k]] and [[Roth IRA]] provide little risk but little access, while investment accounts provide easier access for more risk.

The market has never been down over a 20 year period, and outside of 1998-2008 it has never been down over a ten year period. This means that as long as you are not within 10 years of retirement the money in your [[401k]] and [[Roth IRA]] are safe.

These two accounts are both valuable to invest in but have slight differences

The main benefits of a [[401k]] are the employer contribution, 
^[Employer's will match a percentage of your contribution]
it being a pre-tax contribution, and the large amount you can invest.
^[$20,500]
There are also various legal protections for 401k's that don't apply to most people.

The downside of a [[401k]] are that you will pay capital gains tax on the money you receive from the fund in retirement, and that the money in the fund is very hard to access.

A [[Roth IRA]] is also a long term fund, but it's benefits are slightly different. Roth IRA's are contributed to post-tax, but you don't have to pay capital gains tax on the money you receive.
The amount you can contribute is much less, ^[$6000] but the money is slightly more accessible
