#### [[The Politicization of the Christian Church]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

The modern church is focused on building a [[counter-culture]] movement that is loyal to a fault. [[homophobia]] takes sin from the realm of actions to lifestyle, [[creationism]] erodes peoples [[faith]] in science, [[abortion]] forces people to vote for one political party without even caring about the rest of its platform. I just see Christians being taken advantage of time and time again because they believe so deeply. [^1]

- [[Non-faith issues have been co-opted to keep people in the Christian church]]
	- ex: How [[Ronald Reagan invented modern conservatism]]
	- [[The moral majority movement was the original 'making things political']]
- [[People have been conditioned to believe the bible has to be infallible]]
	- ex: [[The bible is god breathed]]
