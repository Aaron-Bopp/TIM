#### [[You can't blame people for failing to rise above their circumstances]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Most humans will not rise above their situation.
^[In fact, it could be said that no person does depending on your belief in [[free will]]: 
[[Do we have free will]]]
Modern [[America|American]] [[Culture]] often blames people for not "pulling themselves up by their bootstraps." 
This widespread belief is mainly due to [[propaganda]] that is spread about [[America]]'s superiority,
^[and thus is largely rooted in [[white supremacy]]:
[[Whiteness was created to marginalize people of color]]]
but can be seen around the world.
People lack the [[empathy]] to understand why other people would make decisions differently than they would, but [[Empathy isn't understanding how you would make the decision it's understanding why they made the decision]].
I think a lot of the reliance on this belief is built up because of [[inter-generational trauma]] and because of the [[socio-economic]] situations of the last 50-100 years: [[Colonization and slavery lead to generational disparities in black communities]]

Blaming people for failing to rise above their situation is not only unfair, it is unsupported by evidence. #TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH
