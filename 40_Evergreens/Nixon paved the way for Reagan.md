#### [[Nixon paved the way for Reagan]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Nixon]] was elected into the White House endorsing the ideas of "law and order," the "silent majority," and as spokesman of middle-[[America]] [^1], which are still at the core of the [[Republican]] party. While his presidency would later be marred with corruption, this only paves the way for small-[[government]] anti-corruption candidates like [[Reagan]] to sweep the country in 1980, and Trump in 2020.

This is beginning of the [[Rise of Modern Conservatism]] because [[Ronald Reagan invented modern conservatism]]

It's interesting to look at the way [[Watergate]] was handled, and then look at the scandals of recent presidents: [[Republican voters do not hold their leaders accountable]].
