#### [[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This environment includes our physical environment (the one we [[experience]]),
our chemical environment (what is going into the body, and what is the brain producing),
and our emotional environment (how our [[mind]] is reacting to our physical and chemical environments).
Whether through chemical imbalances 
^[[[ADHD]], [[gender dysphoria]], [[depression]]]
or [[repressed]] [[emotions]] 
^[[[Insecure material conditions increase cognitive load and reduce outcomes]]]
it makes sense that these internal stimuli our mental state would reflect our environment,
but sometimes external stimuli like societal structure 
^[[[capitalism]]]
or [[material conditions]],
^[[[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]]]
produce more complex emotional reactions.

%% #TO/TEND/MULCH [[Complex emotions are intellectual understandings of primal urges]], is an internal reaction to an internal stimuli.
[[Biology supports the validity of trans people]] and [[Complex emotions are intellectual understandings of primal urges]], so often there will be many comorbid [[mental illness]] that can be treated, when the chemical imbalances in your brain are the root cause.
