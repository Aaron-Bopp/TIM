#### [[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This environment includes our physical environment (what our [[senses]] our returning),
our chemical environment (the chemical our [[brain]] and [[body]] produce and consume),
and our emotional environment (how our [[mind]] is reacting to our physical and chemical environments).
Whether through chemical imbalances 
or [[repressed]] [[emotions]] 
it makes sense that these internal stimuli our mental state would reflect our environment,
but sometimes external stimuli like societal structure 
or [[material conditions]],
produce more complex emotional reactions.

Ways to alter our environment: 
- [[Tips for concentration]]
- [[Meditation is a practice to gain control over your thoughts]]

#TO/TEND/GRAFT 
- [[Anxiety prevents us from living in the present]]
- [[Anxiety causes us to reject nuance]]
- [[Sometimes we can't grow until we change our environment]]
- [[Insecure material conditions increase cognitive load and reduce outcomes]]
