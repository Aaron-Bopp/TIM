#### [[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This environment includes our physical environment (what our [[senses]] are returning),
our chemical environment (the [[neurotransmitter]]s our [[brain]] and [[body]] produce and consume),
and our emotional environment (how our [[mind]] is reacting to our physical and chemical environments).
Whether through chemical imbalances 
or [[repressed]] [[emotions]] 
it makes sense that these internal stimuli 
would reflect our environment,
but sometimes external stimuli like societal structure 
or [[material conditions]],
produce more complex emotional reactions.

This is 
part of:: [[Sometimes we can't grow until we change our environment]].
