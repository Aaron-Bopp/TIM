#### [[How to title your notes]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

The titles of your notes are often the most important piece about them. Whether you are looking through a file system or seeing the note linked from somewhere else, if the note title is not accurate you're access to that note's information will be impeded.

Many different systems have different ways of titling notes. In traditional [[Zettlekassen]] systems the note is often titled with a UUID or time stamp that means any note created will not collide with any existing note. Part of the reason this is done so that the note can have a consistent reference, and another is so that there is as little barrier as possible to creating a note. Both of these can be solved in other ways and often are to avoid have a long string of unintelligible characters on every note.

[[evergreen notes]] systems take a different approach. Note's are usually written completely in plain text and sometimes contain special marker symbols. [[Andy Matuschak]] said that note title's should be like [[API]]'s. This is to mean that note titles convey the necessary information for knowing what kind of information is in the note. This method provides notes that are more easily interpreted when linked, or when seen in a file structure.

In [[My Second Brain]] this is how I title note's
The only constraint on the way notes are titled is uniqueness. If you are creating a new note and run into a naming conflict it can mean one of a few things.
1. The old note's title is too broad and should be changed
2. the new note's title is too broad and should be changed
3. Both note's titles are too broad and they should be related by a [[topic note]]. 
4. Both note's title are accurate and they should be combined/edited together

Note titles can also very on their use within the [[web of thought]]. [[Webs of thought are densely linked]].
