#### [[Motivation and obsession are indistinguishable to an outside perspective]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

What is the inner feeling behind [[motivation]]? What is the inner feeling behind [[obsession]]?

- [[The most reliable path to success is repeatedly trying to succeed]]
- [[Right kinds of thoughts lead to right kinds of actions]]
- Similarly to [[Our brain actively inhibits us from processing repressed emotions]], our [[brain]] has some level of control over what we are thinking about: [[Neurodivergent people cannot stop their brain from solving problems]]
Pushing yourself is something that is unique to humans.
- contrasts:: [[Humans are a product of evolution]]
