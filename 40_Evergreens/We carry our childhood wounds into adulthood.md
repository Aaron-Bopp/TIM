#### [[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]] 

When we are children, our emotional state is very malleable.
%% #TO/TEND/MULCH If we experience a strong emotion for the first time, %%
This means that we can often be surprisingly resistant,
but it also means that negative experiences can have lifelong impacts, 
especially if we are not taught good [[coping-mechanisms]].
These childhood wounds vary in severity. 
Some might be as simple as your dog eating an ice cream cone out of your hand or somebody refusing to play with you, they can be more intellectual in nature such as feelings of abandonment or worthlessness, or they can be as severe as [[trauma]].
These wounds will manifest in two ways, as triggers based on similar scenarios,
^[explained by:: [[Triggers activate stored emotional responses for certain situations]]]
and as strong assumptions about how the world works.
^[explained by:: [[Children make wide assumptions about the world]]]

These wounds are able to stay with us for so long 
because:: [[Our brain actively inhibits us from processing repressed emotions]].
It is only with focused effort and openness that we can even discover what these wounds are
and start to retrain our reactions to them.
^[This 
explains:: [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]].]

Sometimes the fact that these wounds are so powerful can produce extremely resilient and self-sacrificial behavior.
While the wounds can have large impacts on our lives, they don't make us *us*. 
In the end:: [[It's always worth it to work through trauma]].
