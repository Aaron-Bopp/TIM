#### [[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]] 

[[Children make wide assumptions about the world]] and 
negative experiences cause us to make the largest assumptions 
because:: [[Negative influences impact us more than positive influences]]. 

These wounds make their way into adulthood in mainly through the heavy interaction of two traits.

[[Triggers activate stored emotional responses for certain situations]] will bring up heavy emotional responses to situations as simple as asking for help or being complimented on our appearance,
but [[Our brain actively inhibits us from processing repressed emotions]] prevents us from understanding where those emotions are coming from.

This 
results in:: [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]] and [[Confidence is a feedback loop]]
and is 
made worse by:: [[Self-hatred is born out of dissonance between self-image and self-perception]] and  [[Most anxiety isn't irrational it's just overcompensation]].

 > <cite>[[Dr. K]]</cite>

While the wounds can have large impacts on our lives, they don't make us *us*. This is
why:: [[It's always worth it to work through trauma]]
