#TO/DO/FIND video about childhood wounds

Especially in [[childhood]], negative experiences cause us to make wide assumptions about the world. Because [[Negative influences are stronger than positive influences]], these experiences can become integral parts of our [[personality|personalities]] or form into [[mental illness]].

Childhood influences cause us to make massive, sweeping assumptions about our lives, because our understanding of the world is so limited and [[Our brains are built around survival]]. Any formative experience will impact a large portion of our understanding of the world because we do not understand the context or the importance of that experience. 

- [ ] #TO/TEND/CONCEPTUALIZE [[social anxiety]] disorders can lead to introverted, highly socially aware individuals, and addressing that [[anxiety]] can sometimes be seen as the destruction of an essential part of that person. These assumptions can also result in [[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]]. [[Social anxiety isn't irrational it's just overcompensation]] so while some of these feelings are valid, on the whole removing these anxieties will only allow you to flourish. possibly related to [[Anxiety should be a tool at your disposal not an impedance to your life]]
