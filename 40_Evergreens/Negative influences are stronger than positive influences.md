#### [[Negative influences are stronger than positive influences]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This is true especially in childhood, because we [[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]], but it is also true as we try to [[socialization|socialize]] with other and seek out their [[validation]]. This is especially noticeable if you create things: one bad review is worse than a hundred good reviews: [[Longform media lets you reach people where they are at, short form media lets you reach people where you are at]]

There may be a root in [[Evolutionary Pyschology]] [^1]  or it could be more related to [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]]. Either way, negative influences root theirselves in our [[insecurity|insecurities]] and [[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]]. Valueing a negative [[influence]] more than a positive one could mean we are more prepared against negative outcomes.
