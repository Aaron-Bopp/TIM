#### [[Atheists don't lack belief they lack religious belief]] 

You can't believe a negative. 
Their [[belief]] is based on 
another source of [[truth]].

For some this source of [[truth]] is themselves. Either believing that nobody needs [[belief]] or that they don't need [[belief]]. In reality this is a form of belief in and of itself.
This requires a massive capacity for [[cognitive dissonance]], which most atheists don't have.

The second is belief in a process.

Atheists insistence that god doesn't exist is an acknowledgement of these other beliefs.
If they believe in science, they believe that there is not enough evidence for god.
If they believe in themselves, they just don't believe they can be wrong.
^[symptom of:: [[Our ego defends every belief we hold conscious or subconscious]]]
