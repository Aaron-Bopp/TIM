#### [[Gender has historically been non-binary]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

> For as long as human civilization has existed, there have been people [^2] whose experience of their internal [[gender]] does not align with the physical features of their body. The Gala, a middle [[gender]] priest class of the Sumerian empire, existed over 4,500 years ago. The [[Indigenous]] cultures of North [[America]] recognized a third gender [^3] far before European colonialism, and still do to this day. Roman emperor Elagabalus (218 AD) insisted on being referred to as Lady rather than Lord, and even put forward a ransom for anyone who could conduct genital reconstruction surgery. [^1]
