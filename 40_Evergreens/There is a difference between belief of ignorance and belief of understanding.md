#### [[There is a difference between belief of ignorance and belief of understanding]]

- [[Atheists don't lack belief they lack religious belief]]
- [[Strong enough logic becomes belief]]

Belief of [[ignorance]] is belief that you do not know everything about anything. This belief should drive a want to understand more and to find out more about the world. It develops into philosophies that make growth and change part of their process. You cannot have a belief of [[ignorance]] without being able to admit that you might be wrong.

Belief of [[understanding]] is belief that you have stumbled upon the correct explanation for something. You believe that what you think and know about something is complete enough to be true. This develops into philosophies that are self-referential and try to close loops as quickly as possible. Unanswered questions must be dealt with as they represent chinks in the armor of the worldview.

Generally belief of ignorance is more common is [[science]] and belief of understanding is more common in [[religion]], people of either persuasion can follow either.

Scientific racism and eugenics 
%% and even some of the messaging around [[COVID-19]] %%
fall into belief of understanding. While rooted in science, they believe that have come to the final place of understanding that science will produce and that it should not be questioned.

There are also some religious people that have a belief of ignorance, such as [[Guy Consolmagno]] or [[David Wolpe]] who believe that there is a greater truth that is God, but that they are ignorant of it and must pursue it in much the same way as science pursues knowledge.

It is much easier for use to fall into belief of [[understanding]].
