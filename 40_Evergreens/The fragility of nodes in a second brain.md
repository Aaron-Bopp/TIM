#### [[The fragility of nodes in a second brain]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Nodes in the second brain are an abstraction of our first brain]], if something is irrelevant it will slowly fade, but in our [[second brain]] nothing dissapears. Rather, it becomes fragile, cluttering and distracting until it is destroyed. [^1] This is why the second brain needs help from the first, to remove clutter and to provide strong connections. 

[^1]: This is because [[Nodes in the second brain are made up of impermanent data and permanent metadata]] and the metadata of nodes connect them to others. Even when you delete a note, the metadata of that note remains explicitly in the vault

In [[My TIM]] I have created a classification structure and one of it's purposes is to group nodes that are most fragile together. The fragility of these nodes define how likely they are to be removed, or to become irrelevant. 

##### Node classification

[[Source notes]] are the most fragile because we interact with them the least. New studies come out, new books are published, the tide of public opinion turns and suddenly your source is no longer relevant. Sources become obsolete over time, but the [[knowledge]] we glean from them grows over time, which is why we place it in [[evergreen notes]].

[[topic note|Topics]] rarely become irrelevant but can easily become clutter. Any simple idea can have large affects on the world, but that does not mean they will all have large effects in our mind specifically, that is why I subcategorize them into [[stub notes|stubs]] (there to provide the possibility of connection), [[Term notes|terms]] (there to provide easy access to their definition), and outlines (there to provide a structure). Stub's and terms can be filtered out or be included in outlines until they become important enough on to be on their own.

[[evergreen notes|Evergreens]] are the quentisential conceptual [^2] node of the second brain. They are interlinked with each other and apply to many topics. Each one provides context and recieves context from others, but can still stand on their own. Evergreens may need to be pruned, but they rarely need to be felled. These are the least fragile and the most powerful nodes, which is why they are our focus: [[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]]

[^2]: [[Conceptual notes are lexically superior to atomic notes]]

There are more subcategorizations that provide clarification on what a node will do:

- **Techniques** are evergreen in that they can always be refined or always show us how we failed. 
- **Questions** are evergreen in that they prompt us to answer them or forever ponder them. 
- **Tools** are topics in that classify knowledge and techinques
- **People** are sources as they provide knowledge and fragile in that they are human
