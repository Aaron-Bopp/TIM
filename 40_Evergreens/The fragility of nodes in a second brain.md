#### [[The fragility of nodes in a second brain]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

In our first brain there is no such thing as "fragility" there is only learning and forgetting, but in the second brain learning doesn't happen on it's own and forgetting is impossible.

All notes in the [[second brain]] are nodes, data (content) and metadata (links, fields, file info). They are an abstraction of our first brain, where all thoughts are made up of the electrons connecting neurons. The path's between these neurons are strengthed through use and weakened by disuse and through a [[web of thought]] create [[conscious|consciousness]]. If something is irrelevant it will slowly fade, but in our [[second brain]] nothing dissapears, but rather becomes fragile, cluttering and distracting until it is destroyed. This is why the second brain needs help from the first, to remove clutter and to provide strong connections. In [[My TIM]] I have created a classification structure to facilitate this. The fragility of these nodes define how likely they are to be removed, or to become irrelevant. 

[[Source notes]] are the most fragile. New studies come out, new books are published, the tide of public opinion turns and suddenly your source is no longer relevant, or wiped from the face of the earth entirely. Sources become obsolete over time, but the information we glean from them grows over time.

[[topic note|Topics]] rarely become irrelevant but can easily become clutter. Any simple idea can have large affects on the world, but that does not mean they will all have large effects in our mind, that is why I subcategorize them into stubs (there to provide the possibility of connection), terms (there to provide easy access to their definition), and outlines (there to provide a structure). Stub's and terms can be filtered out or be included in outlines until they become important enough on to be on their own.

[[evergreen notes|Evergreens]] are the quentisential node of the second brain. They are interlinked which each other and apply to many topics. Each one provides context and recieves context from others, but can still stand on it's own. Evergreens may need to be pruned but they rarely need to be felled. These are the least fragile and the most powerful nodes, which is why they are our focus.

There are more subcategorizations that provide clarification on what a node will do:
- **Techniques** are evergreen in that they can always be refined or always show us how we failed. 
- **Questions** are evergreen in that they prompt us to answer them or forever ponder them. 
- **Tools** are topics in that classify knowledge and techinques
- **People** are sources as they provide knowledge and fragile in that they are human
