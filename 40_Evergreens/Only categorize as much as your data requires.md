#### [[Only categorize as much as your data requires]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

It can be tempting to try to categorize all the [[knowledge]] that you are gathering in your [[second brain]], but over-categorization can lead to wasting time on categorizations that in the end will be inaccurate. 
Try to create [[topic note|topic notes]] when you are overwhelmed, and stop creating them when you start feeling confined, or start categorizing things just to categorize them. [[topic note|Topic notes]] should be a boon to accessing your knowledge, not a distractor: [[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge]]

It is easier to cutout sections of large topic notes and create subtopics, than it is to have to recategorize a swath of notes. 

[[Organization systems are not mutually exclusive]], do not confine yourself to one [[system of thought]]. When you start to feel [[friction]], trust that feeling: [[Friction is a hindrance to learning]]

Over-organization will just lead to incorrect categorization: [[Prioritize organization over categorization]]
