#### [[You can discover your transness at any point in life]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Our understanding of gender begins at a very early age]] and through the [[Gender self-socialization model]] we can see that children don't have to be forced to conform to their assigned gender or have their true gender shunned in order to repress themselves. While many in the trans [[community]] have obvious signs from their childhood,
lack of those signs doesn't mean they weren't there and doesn't make your transness any less valid:
[[Any experience of gender is acceptable]]

You very well could have understood your [[gender]] and simply be unable to remember it,
because [[Trans children will repress their dysphoria if they have been effectively taught it is unacceptable]].
