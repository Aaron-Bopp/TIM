#### [[You can discover your transness at any point in life]] 

Through the [[Gender self-socialization model]] we can see that children don't have to be forced to conform to their assigned [[gender]] or have their true gender shunned in order to repress themselves. 
While many in the trans [[community]] have obvious signs from their [[childhood]],
lack of those signs doesn't mean they weren't there and doesn't make your transness any less valid,
[[Our understanding of gender begins at a very early age]] so 
you very well could have understood your [[gender]] and simply be unable to remember it
because:: [[Trans children will repress their dysphoria if they have been effectively taught it is unacceptable]].

This is
why:: [[Any experience of gender is acceptable]].
