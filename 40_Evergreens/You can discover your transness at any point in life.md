#### [[You can discover your transness at any point in life]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Our understanding of gender begins at a very early age]] and through the [[Gender self-socialization model]] we can see that children don't have to be forced to conform to their assigned gender or have their true gender shunned in order to repress ourselves. While many in the trans [[community]] have obvious signs from their childhood lack of those signs doesn't mean they weren't there and doesn't make your [[transgender|transness]] any less valid because [[Any experience of gender is acceptable]], and [[Any experience of gender dysphoria is acceptable]].

[[Trans children will repress their dysphoria if they have been effectively taught it is unnaceptable]] you very well could have understood your gender and simply be unable to remember it.
