#### [[You can discover your transness at any point in life]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Our understanding of gender begins at a very early age]] and through the [[Gender self-socialization model]] we can see that children do have to be forced to conform to their assigned gender or have their true gender shunned in order to repress ourselves. While many in the trans community have obvious signs from their childhood lack of those signs doesn't mean they weren't there and doesn't make your [[transgender|transness]] any less valid.
