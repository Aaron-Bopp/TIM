#### [[Humans have had little time to adjust to being the top predator]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

One of the boons of [[Evolution]]'s incredibly long periods of change is that everything in an [[ecosystem]] is given time to adapt to and understand the changes in other species. [[Homo sapiens]] completely ruins this. At break neck (evolutionary) speeds we have advanced
from scavenger's
^[[[Cracking bones and eating the marrow may have been human's first niche]]]
to annihilator's. 
^[[[Human caused extinction is prevalent]]]
While this has had obvious effects on the food chain, it may also have less obvious effects on our psyche. While we have the security and influence of a top predator, we still have the anxieties, fears, and instincts of an underdog.
