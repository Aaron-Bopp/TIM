#### [[Meditation regulates your hormones and stress physiology]] 

20 minutes of [[meditation]] every day or every other day will impact your [[stress]] physiology through turning off your [[Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal (HPA) Axis|Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal Axis]] which reduce stress inducing [[hormone]]s like [[Cortisol]]. This has a variety of positive impacts to your [[immune system]] and [[brain]].
^[[[notes_Science of Meditation]]]

Our body will regularly produce [[hormone|hormones]] to produce a higher chance of survival.
^[[[Our brains are built around survival]]]
Unfortunately, those [[hormone|hormones]] can lead to unneeded [[anxiety]], and are why [[Most anxiety isn't irrational it's just overcompensation]]

This is how [[meditation]] could also affect [[ADHD]] as [[ADHD]] is largely affected by [[hormone|hormones]] like [[Dopamine]]:
[[ADHD is not a lack of attention it is a misplacement of attention]]

For more on how [[meditation]] can effect the [[body]]
