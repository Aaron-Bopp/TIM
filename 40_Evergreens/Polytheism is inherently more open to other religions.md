#### [[Polytheism is inherently more open to other religions]]

If your [[religion]] allows for belief in multiple different gods, then it is likely that it includes some mechanism that allows for different gods to come into the fold.
It would be pretty hard to be collecting different gods,
and then to suddenly decide alright these are the ones and any other gods are fake.
This can also be explained through different understandings of the same gods, or as different gods being different manifestations of underlying forces.

#TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH does this hold true for [[Hinduism]] today

part of:: [[The materialistic view of religions examines why humans invented and clung to religion]]

#TO/TEND/GRAFT 
- [[Worldviews should be open ended and adaptive]]
- [[Religious claims of absolute truth are always insubstantiable]]
