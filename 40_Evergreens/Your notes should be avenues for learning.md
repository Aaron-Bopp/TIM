#### [[Your notes should be avenues for learning]] 

Notes are more than just text or connections, they are a workplace for you to gather [[information]] and gain [[understanding]].

Each of my types of notes exemplifies this in different ways.
%% [[source notes]] are little more than a place to write some basic notes or store some highlights, but how much I have referenced them shows my progress at processing what I read.  %%
[[Topic notes]] are places to gather [[information]], define terms, and disambiguate between other's ideas. Usually, they aren't very insightful, but they can be powerful for making headway on more difficult topics.

> [!example]
> 
> When I first got into [[physics]], I would watch various Youtube videos that gave me basic, high-level understanding of the various topics. These videos weren't dense or educational enough to take notes on, but they did help me get a basic [[understanding]]. After I finished a video I would write a short summary to see how well I understood the video. 
> ^[This recall also helped me remember what was in it]
> Then I would go an make [[topic notes]] about the terms in the videos, and use the [[Wikipedia (plugin, obsidian)]] to import the intro page for each term. 
> I would then read through and revise the page to my liking based off my understanding from the videos.
> Having the videos to be [[cognitive scaffolding]] was very helpful in understanding what information was important, and know I have a short summary of these terms that I can review with [[spaced repetition]] and continue to revise. 
> This proved to be an efficient way to get value out of video content and Wikipedia.

There are three types of [[knowledge]] that are relevant to us.
- What is known
- What you know about what is known
- What you know

The only way we can learn is by transforming [[information]] from being what other people know, to what we know,
