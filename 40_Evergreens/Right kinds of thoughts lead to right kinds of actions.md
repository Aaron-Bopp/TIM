#### [[Right kinds of thoughts lead to right kinds of actions]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Every action must be proceeded by an thought. If we fill our [[mind]] with productive thoughts then we will have productive actions. If we can focus our thoughts on one action over time we will see positive benefits or [[karma]]. [[Dharana]] is training our [[mind]] to do this, and though it we develop our [[motivation]]:
[[Motivation is focusing on one task until completion]]

 [[Self-belief is fundamental to good karma]]
