#### [[Right kinds of thoughts lead to right kinds of actions]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Every action must be proceeded by a thought. If we fill our [[mind]] with productive thoughts then we will have productive actions. If we can focus our thoughts on one action over time we will see positive benefits or [[karma]]. [[Dharana]] is training our [[mind]] to do this, and though it we develop our [[motivation]]:
[[You can't control what happens you can only control what you do]]

 - [[Self-belief is fundamental to good karma]]
 - [[Consciousness is the fundamental unit of existence]]
	 - [[Consciousness is our capacity to introspect]]
	 - [[Meditation is a practice to develop a stronger conscious]]
- [[The most reliable path to success is repeatedly trying to succeed]]
