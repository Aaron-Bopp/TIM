#### [[How and when Obsidian's graph can be useful]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

If have less than ~200 notes, don't think to much about the graph. It can be really fun to look at, but you will be tempted to overlink, to make notes just to add links to them and it will distract you from actually adding value to your vault. [[Programming is a powerful tool and a dangerous toy]]. If you have more than ~200 notes and want to get value out of your graph read on. 

First: Maximize link force, minimize link distance, and find a balance between repel force and centering force where you can start to see groupings of related notes. This will work somewhat for just [[evergreen notes]], but will work even better if you have topic notes that naturally appear in notes without you having to think about linking them.

There will start to be noticeable stuctures:
- Large groupings of evergreen notes around large topics 
- Related topics growing closer together with more shared notes
- New areas of study/thought can be seen as penninsulas and islands
- Interdisciplinary notes can be seen as connecting two largely seperate topic groups. 

As you spend more time in the graph you will start to recognize related structures of notes: a three notes that are always in a line, two notes that are always right next to eachother despite not being linked. These show you how
