#### [[Note storage is important because it defines how you access and retain knowledge]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

For a proper [[knowledge management|personal knowledge management]] system, this question is very important, and aligns with your values. 

Possible tools:
- [[Obsidian (software)]] 
- [[Roam Research (software)]]
- [[Mem (software)]]
- [[Twitter]] [^1]
- Paper notes (or slip notes ala [[Zettelkasten]]) ^[There is also this legacy article that is very fascinating [[articles_General Principles]]]

If you would like to easily access your notes anywhere without hassle and have lots of easy interfaces to work with, [[Evernote]] or [[Roam Research (software)]] would be very good options, but if you would like to be able to use tools like [[Git]], scripting, or be able to access your notes from multiple different systems plaintext files are the best choice, and the best choice for plaintext files is [[Obsidian (software)]].

[[Choosing a note writing system is choosing a system for thought]], but sometimes just starting is more important so [[When in doubt, write what you think]].
