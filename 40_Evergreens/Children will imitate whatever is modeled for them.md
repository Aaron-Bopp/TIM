#### [[Children will imitate whatever is modeled for them]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

#TO/TEND/DEOBFUSCATE this, [[Parents need to model the ability to deal with emotion to their children]], [[Our authority figures curate and reinforce what we are allowed to imitate]]

This fact of imitation and modeling is key in [[Social Learning Theory]]. This leads to so many elements of modern society such as [[gender roles]], [[racism]], and [[inter-generational trauma]]. Primarily because [[Parents need to model the ability to deal with emotion to their children]].

This fact is true in both synchronous interactions like fear responses and [[self soothing]], but also in asynchronous responses like in [[Gender self-socialization model]]. This means that children may see an action and then not reproduce for months or years later. [[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]], when behaviors become engrained in our pyschy, we will rarely question them. [^1]

[^1]: [[Our brain will do anything it can to protect itself]]

Parent's need to be aware of how their behaviors can affect their children: [[Our authority figures curate and reinforce what we are allowed to imitate]]. [[trauma]] in the home will very much transfer to the child in some way: [[Children in traumatic households expect more love than their parents can give]]
