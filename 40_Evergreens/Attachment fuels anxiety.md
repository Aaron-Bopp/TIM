#### [[Attachment fuels anxiety]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[The ultimate goal of the mind is to keep thinking]],
and attachment is a major driver for [[attention]] and thus what we put [[energy]] into.
If you are attached to some event in the future, 
your [[brain]] will take advantage of that.
^[[[notes_Thought Loops]]]
Where [[anxiety]] comes in is when you lack [[confidence]] about that thing you are attached to.
[[Anxiety stems from a lack of confidence for the future]] and 
[[Confidence comes when you are more capable of handling diverse outcomes]]

When you have a weak [[identity]], you are going to fall into this more because
[[A secure identity is the best defense against social anxiety]]
but
[[Anxiety prevents us from living in the present]]

#TO/TEND/PRUNE 
This is made more complicated by
[[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]]
but
[[Most anxiety isn't irrational it's just overcompensation]],
if you can gain perspective and [[objectivity]] over your anxiety, 
you can prevent the negative effects of
[[Anxiety causes us to reject nuance]].
This is why [[detachment]] is so powerful for reducing [[anxiety]],
it allows you to gain both of these things and break off your brain's connection to it's food source.
