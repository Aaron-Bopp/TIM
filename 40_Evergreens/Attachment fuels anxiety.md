#### [[Attachment fuels anxiety]] 

[[Emotional attachment]] is a major driver for [[attention]] and thus what we put [[energy]] into.
If you are attached to some event in the future, 
your [[brain]] will take advantage of that.
^[[[The ultimate goal of the mind is to keep thinking]], [[notes - Learned Anxiety]]]
Where [[anxiety]] comes in is when you lack [[confidence]] about that thing you are attached to, because
[[Anxiety stems from a lack of confidence for the future]]. 

This is made more complicated by
[[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]].
When you have a weak [[identity]], you are going to fall into this more because
[[A secure identity is the best defense against social anxiety]]

If you can gain perspective and [[objectivity]] over your anxiety, 
you can prevent the negative effects of
[[Anxiety tries to make us assume the worst]].
This is why [[emotional detachment]] is so powerful for reducing [[anxiety]],
it allows you to gain both of these things and break off your brain's connection to it's food source.
