Hell is rarely mentioned in the bible and when it is, it isn't a literal fiery hell. A lot of our modern [[perception]] of hell comes from comes from dante's fictional inferno, but that doesn't mean that conditioning and almost brainwashing isn't still there haunting many [[Christianity|christians]]: [[The church will fail if christians keep aligning themselves with hate instead of love]]
