#### [[God is the human capacity to believe]] 

In [[10_Sources/Readwise/Books/books - The Road|The Road by Cormac McCarthy]], we follow the story of a father and son, travelling through a barren, dangerous post-apocalyptic world. 
There is little reason for [[hope]] on the road, except for one, God.
This is not the god of the [[Christianity]], nor any other [[religion]].
This not the promise of a savior that will come and transform this world into a paradise.
This God is simply a boy, the man's son, the man's [[hope]].

> He knew only that the child was his warrant. He said: If he is not the word of God, God never spoke.

We can also see this is messianic narratives such as Jesus in *the Bible*, Kelsier in *Mistborn*, and Paul Atreides in *Dune*.
Each of these men do not single-handedly save their people,
but they do provide the thing that is most needed for a downtrodden people, hope.

In this case, to believe is to hope for better days. This understanding of hope is 
explained by:: [[Hope is not optimism it is a practice for producing change]]

This is 
part of:: [[The materialistic view of religions examines why humans invented and clung to religion]].

What is the nature of god? God is a social construction. God is our [[understanding]] of the things we cannot understand. God is a reason to go on.

- explained by:: [[Belief helps us push through hardship]]
- example of:: [[Humans have decided to reject an unjust world]]
