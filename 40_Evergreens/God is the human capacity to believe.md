#### [[God is the human capacity to believe]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

In [[books_The Road|The Road by Cormac McCarthy]], we follow the story of a father and son, travelling through a barren, dangerous post-apocalyptic world. 
There is little reason for [[hope]] on the road, except for one, God.
This is not the god of the [[Christianity]], nor any other [[religion]].
This not the promise of a savior that will come and transform this world into a paradise.
This God is simply a boy, the man's son, the man's hope.

> He knew only that the child was his warrant. He said: If he is not the word of God, God never spoke.

This is 
part of:: [[The materialistic view of religions examines why humans invented and clung to religion]].

What is the nature of god? God is a social construction. God is our [[understanding]] of the things we cannot understand. God is a reason to go on.


#TO/TEND/GRAFT 
- [[Belief pulls you forward into life]]
- [[Humans have decided to reject an unjust world]]
