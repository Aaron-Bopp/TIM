#### [[Identity is your understanding of yourself vs your interaction with the world]] 

At the core of your [[identity]] is how you view yourself ([[self-image]]) vs how you understand the world's view of you ([[self-perception]]).
If you have a weak [[self-image]] then how the world views you will completely win, resulting in little to no sense of [[self]]
e.g. [[Self-hatred is born out of dissonance between self-image and self-perception]].

Many people will think they have a strong [[self]], but this is just there concerted efforts to conform to society's views. [[Identity]] is internal, not a pattern of traits or behavior.
Other's may feel a very strong sense of [[self]] just because their sense of [[self]] is aligned with society's view of them.

If your understanding of the world is impaired that means that your [[self]] will be hard to understand,
because [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]].
In the end, [[A secure identity is the best defense against social anxiety]].

#TO/PONDER what is the definition of self in this note?
%%
#TO/TEND/MULCH 
Those who think they have a weak [[self]] have either realized that they do not have a sense of [[self]] outside of how other's treat them, or that they do not reveal their inner sense of [[self]] to other people.

However, [[self]] is more than just an objective viewing of our actions. [[self]] is also impacted by the physical reactions that our bodies go through. If we feel a certain way during an interaction that will impact our [[self]], either through a [[consciousness|conscious]] viewing and reflection on that feeling, or a [[subconscious]] reaction to either avoid or pursue that feeling again. [[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]]%%

#TO/TEND/PRUNE One of these notes
This concept relates the different concepts of identity and presentation: [[Presentation is the realization of our self-perception and identity is the realization of our self-image]]
