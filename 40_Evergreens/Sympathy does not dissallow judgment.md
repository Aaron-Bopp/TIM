We cannot hope for someone if we have [[judgement|judged]] them and if we cannot hope for someone how can we [[human advancement|advance]].



> I don’t hate TERFs. I think for the most part they are **lonely, scared people,** often [[trauma|traumatized]], and they are trying to alleviate their pain by lashing out at a safe target, which is something hurt people often do. But **that doesn’t mean that I accept or excuse their behavior.** 
> ...It is possible to [[sympathy|sympathize]] and even forgive while still setting strong boundaries around them.

But I don’t let my [[empathy]] blind me to the harm they do. [^1]
