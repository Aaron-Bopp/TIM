#### [[People have been conditioned to believe the bible has to be infallible]] 

- part of:: [[Non-faith issues have been co-opted to keep people in the Christian church]]

%% #TO/TEND/WEED  %%
This is
explained by:: how the belief that [[The bible is god breathed]] has become such a key part of [[Evangelicalism]].
This has placed too much importance on a book that could not hope to give the answers needed to live in a modern [[society]].

This discourages actually working with the doctrine to understand how you should live in the world and instead says that you must adhere to a 2000-year-old book. [[Searching for THE answer is dangerous]], but it is strictly encouraged by [[Christianity]].
This has been built up as major part in [[Christianity|Christians]] psyches and affects a lot of their [[subconscious]] decision-making.
This leads to [[What are the blindspots of the Christian worldview]]

- works with:: [[Faith is an abstraction of cognitive dissonance]]
- explains:: [[The Christian worldview is incompatible with most other worldviews]]
