#TO/TEND/GRAFT 
- [[The bible is god breathed]]
- [[Non-faith issues have been co-opted to keep people in the Christian church]]
- [[The Christian worldview is incompatible with most other worldviews]]
- [[Christians struggle to feel empathy because they must believe that non-christians are going to hell]]
- [[Humans are addicted to believing]]

- [[The biblical Christian God is evil and does not deserve to be worshipped]]
- [[The actual path to being a good person isn't explored by Evangelicalism]]
- [[Faith is an abstraction of cognitive dissonance]]
