#### [[People have been conditioned to believe the bible has to be infallible]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

#TO/TEND/GRAFT 
- [[The bible is god breathed]]
- [[Non-faith issues have been co-opted to keep people in the Christian church]]
- [[The Christian worldview is incompatible with most other worldviews]]
- [[Christians struggle to feel empathy because they must believe that non-christians are going to hell]]

This has been built up as major part in [[Christianity|Christians]] psyches and affects a lot of their [[subconscious]] decision-making.

This encourages [[Searching for THE answer is dangerous]]
- [[The biblical Christian God is evil and does not deserve to be worshipped]]
- [[Faith is an abstraction of cognitive dissonance]]
