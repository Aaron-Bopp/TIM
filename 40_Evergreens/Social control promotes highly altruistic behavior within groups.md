#### [[Social control promotes highly altruistic behavior within groups]] 


> ![[books_Darwin's Cathedral#^289554239]]

Social control reduces the amount of within-group selection by promoting behavior that benefits the group. This allows behaviors that are highly-altruistic or highly-selfless to evolve.

Group selection -> social control -> self-sacrificial altruism

This is in contrast to [[kin selection]] which would say that individuals would only act for the benefit of closely genetically related relatives,
and [[reciprocal altruism]] which would predict that individuals would only act for the benefit of those who will return the favor.
