#### [[Do what you can for who you can]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

â€¦and sometimes that just means doing everything you can for yourself.

This idea is reflected in [[eastern philosophy]] through [[Ashram]].
[[Ashram]] describes fours stage of life, 
and in only one of those, [[Vanaprastha Ashram]],  do you actually focus on helping other people. 
This matches a [[Do what you can for who you can]] especially when you contrasted with [[Western philosophy]]'s focus on individual sacrifice. 

- contrasts:: [[Be the change you want to see in the world]]
- follows up:: [[Humans have decided to reject an unjust world]]
