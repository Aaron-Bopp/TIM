#### [[Worldviews should be open ended and adaptive]] 

#TO/TEND/WATER 
- explained by:: [[Hard rules create cognitive bias]] and [[Religion promotes high social control]].
	- bad combo, if something doesn't work with your [[religion]]'s logic (or is outright forbid) you are going to be biased against it.
	- this leads to [[Theology preserves hierarchy through deific blessing]]
- because:: [[The way systems work can create cognitive bias]]
- leads to:: [[Use philosophies as far they are useful and nothing more]]

[[The Christian worldview is incompatible with most other worldviews]] because [[Worldviews should not make life seem easy and simple]]. 
As the world continues to change and grow, we see [[Christianity]] starting to clash with modern day perspectives.
^[[[The church will fail if christians keep aligning themselves with hate instead of love]]]
While [[eastern philosophy]] like [[meditation]], [[Yoga]], and even [[Buddhism]] become more and more accepted in the west.
This is because these [[worldview]]s broke down [[humanity]] to it's core elements. As we learn more about how the [[body]] and [[mind]] work, we only see more and more evidence for this viewpoint.
^[[[Ancient yogic techniques are applicable to this day]]]

Even if your [[worldview]] is open ended and adaptive, it does not always mean that you will be. [[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]], but this kind of [[worldview]] and consistent practice of [[meditation]] can help you separate from the irrationality of your [[ego]] and keep your [[self]] open to new ideas: [[Karma is an open ended system of belief]]
