#### [[How to discover your purpose in life]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Get out a piece of paper and answer the question, "What is wrong with the world?" Once you have reached the end of the paper you have some idea of what you should be doing.

This technique is stolen from [[Dr. K]], and more specifically helps you find your [[Dharma]]. [[Dharma]] is a little different than purpose, being closer to [[duty]] or [[responsibility]], but if you are doing this task to find your [[Dharma]], you are already likely to make it your [[purpose]]: 
[[Purpose is derived from within, duty is derived from without]]

"What should my [[purpose]] be in life?" is actually a false question, but it is one we ask incessantly as it is one of [[The three main questions of life]].
