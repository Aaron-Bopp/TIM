#### [[Cooking allowed prehistoric humans to spend less energy on digesting]] 

In order to digest unprocessed plant and animal matter you need to have a long and powerful intestinal tract and spend lots of energy chewing. This is a feature of many species from cows to chimpanzee's, but not of the chimpanzee's close relatives, humans. 
By contrast we spend a much shorter time chewing and digesting and thus can put our energy into other things. This adaptation likely allowed for larger brains
may be linked to cooking.
Cooking breaks down a lot of the proteins that stomachs have to in other animals.
Similarly:: [[Cracking bones and eating the marrow may have been human's first niche]]

leads to:: [[Foraging allowed for a diverse diet]]
