#### [[Cooking allowed prehistoric humans to spend less energy on digesting]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

In order to digest unprocessed plant and animal matter you need to have a long and powerful intestinal tract and spend lots of energy chewing. This is a feature of many species from cows to chimpanzee's, but not of the chimpanzee's close relative, humans. This adaptation may be linked to cooking and and have allowed for larger brains.
