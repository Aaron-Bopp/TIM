#### [[Decimal based organization systems provide the easiest access to common notes]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

When using the [[Johnny Decimal System]], I have come to use certain codes instead of the note name to find some of my most common notes. If I type "Notepad" into [[Obsidian (software)|Obsidian]]'s quick switcher I am bombarded with a list of notes but if I type 209, [[209 Notepad]] immediately comes up. This is preferable to setting certain notes as favorites.
Even if I commonly used the favorites area, I would have to make the decision to make [[209 Notepad]] a favorite, which means I would have to recognize how much I use it, before I make it easier to use. 
%% #TO/TEND/WEED %%
By just typing the name into the quick switcher, I did not need to recognize this, my brain memorized the number on it's own and suddenly I started using the note more.
