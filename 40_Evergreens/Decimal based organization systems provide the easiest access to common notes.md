#### [[Decimal based organization systems provide the easiest access to common notes]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

When using the [[Johnny Decimal System]], I have come to use certain codes instead of the note name to find some of my most common notes. If I type "Notepad" into [[Obsidian (software)|Obsidian]]'s quick switcher I am bombarded with a list of notes but if I type 209, it immediately comes up. This is preferable to setting certain notes as favorites, because the process of memorizing the [[209 Notepad]]'s number is natural not forced. Additionally, I am always using the quick switcher, but would rarely if ever check wherever my favorites were displayed.
