#### [[A totally integrated machine should be infinitely scalable]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

If a [[TIM]] is to truly augment our capability to live, it must be [[infinite|infinitely]] scalable. Many systems are involved in this process.
1. A [[web of thought]] serves as the representation of our [[second brain]] which allows us to access our [[knowledge]]
2. [[evergreen notes]] are the methodology through which we organize and grow our knowledge
3. [[Obsidian (software)]] is the conduit for doing this with the least [[friction]] possible

- [[Webs of thought provide heterarchical structure]]
- [[Densely linked webs of thought provide intuitive access to knowledge]]
- [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]]
- [[A second brain should be an extension of your thought]]
- [[Your second brain should be an inspirational hub of creativity]]
- [[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge]]
