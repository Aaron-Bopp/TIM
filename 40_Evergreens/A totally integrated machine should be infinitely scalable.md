#### [[A totally integrated machine should be infinitely scalable]] 

If a [[TIM]] is to truly augment our capability [[learning|to learn]], it must be [[infinite|infinitely]] scalable. Many systems are involved in this process.
1. A [[web of thought]] serves as the representation of our [[second brain]] which allows us to access our [[knowledge]]
2. [[evergreen notes]] are the methodology through which we organize and grow our knowledge
3. [[Obsidian (software)]] is the conduit for doing this with the least [[friction]] possible

- What are the limits
	- [[We learn by transforming information into understanding]]
		- [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]]
		- [[Evergreen notes should be constantly integrating new knowledge]]
	- [[There is a limit to how much information you can process at once]]
		- [[Densely linked webs of thought provide intuitive access to knowledge]]
		- [[A healthy second brain requires a surplus of entry points]]
	- [[A second brain should mirror how we think]]
		- [[Use spaced repetition as a memory tool for your second brain]]
		- [[A totally integrated machine should automate as much of the thinking process as possible]]
