#### [[We need equity of access not equality of opportunity]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

#TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH definitions of [[equity]] and [[equality]]
Not everybody has the same starting point in life.
[[Belief]] in equality of opportunity would state that as long as all these people have access to the same opportunities, then it is ethical.
However, many have recognized that have the same level of access in theory does not lead to that in reality. 
There are real life [[inequality|inequalities]] that prevent different people from being able to take advantages in the same opportunities. 
^[These inequalities are the result of the two sided coin of [[privilege]] and [[marginalization]]]
Simply providing the same opportunities is not enough,
we must organize society such that people have the same access to the opportunities as well.

There is also a [[neurodiversity]] angle to this #TO/PONDER/IDEA 

- [[Insecure material conditions increase cognitive load and reduce outcomes]]
