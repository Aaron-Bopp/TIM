#### [[When in doubt, write what you think]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Starting to write notes can be intimidating for many reasons, one of which being that you don't know what to write about.
The beauty is that [[A second brain should be an extension of your thought]]. This means you can write about anything that you are thinking about and soon *your thinking will be better:* 
[[Writing is a catalyst of understanding]]

This doesn't mean your [[second brain]] has to be a journal, or a planner, or about you, it can just be whatever you're thinking about. This could mean it is where you put down your school notes, your [[TTRPG]] notes, your dreams, anything. 
Once you have broken through the [[Fear is the number one hindrance to trying|fear of trying]], you will be able to explore [[systems for thought]]: [[Learning how systems work can be a gateway to creating thought]] 

For me this meant [[Write your notes like you're planting an evergreen forest]] and [[Write your notes with a system not within a system]], but your journey will be different: 
[[Communities are knowledge graphs]]
