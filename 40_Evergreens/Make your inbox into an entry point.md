#### [[Make your inbox into an entry point]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

In a [[knowledge management]] system an inbox is the method through which you receive and categorize items into your [[second brain]]. An entry point is a way that you find your way into the [[web of thought]] so that you can find the information that you want to find. 

In a typical inbox you may have things you haven't read, have skimmed, or have read but haven't notated. These things can be entry points into your [[web of thought]] if they are already stored and referenced there, but by storing these potential items in your [[second brain]] you are able to integrate them into the same systems that make a [[second brain]] powerful.
^[[[my TO(DO) and EVER(GREEN) structure]] allows for this]
[[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]], and [[Use spaced repetition as a memory tool for your second brain]], so integrating your inbox will help you grow your existing knowledge and your potential knowledge. 

However, because [[Nodes in the second brain are an abstraction of our first brain#Nodes in the second brain are more fragile than thoughts in the first brain]], by making your inbox a part of your second brain 
you are subjecting it [[The fragility of nodes in a second brain]]. Remember, [[Friction is the number one hindrance to learning]], 
but you can help allieviate this [[friction]] by
[[Your second brain should be frictionless access to a curated base of knowledge|making your second brain a curated base of knowledge]].
