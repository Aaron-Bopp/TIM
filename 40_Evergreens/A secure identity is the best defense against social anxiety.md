#### [[A secure identity is the best defense against social anxiety]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.topicHeader(dv, this)`

[[Confidence comes when you are more capable of handling diverse outcomes]].
If you have [[confidence]] in your ability to handle awkward situations, understand your own emotions, and have [[empathy]] for other people, you will be able to handle the thoughts that fuel [[social anxiety]].

[[Identity is your understanding of yourself vs your interaction with the world]],
so a secure [[identity]] means you have an [[understanding]] of how you interact with the world and how you want to interact. This doesn't mean you are a social butterfly, but it does mean you are confident in your ability to deal with the consequences of social interactions, and you aren't basing any of your [[identity]] on the outcome of social interactions.

The key to forming a secure [[identity]] is in: [[Confidence is a feedback loop]]

By contrast:: [[You can be taught to invalidate your own emotions]]
and this is often the case [[childhood]]:
[[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]]
