#### [[A secure identity is the best defense against social anxiety]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.topicHeader(dv, this)`


[[Confidence comes when you are more capable of handling diverse outcomes]].
If you have [[confidence]] in your ability to handle awkward situations, understand your own emotions, and have [[empathy]] for other people, you have no reason to feel [[social anxiety]].
[[You can be taught to invalidate your own emotions]]
