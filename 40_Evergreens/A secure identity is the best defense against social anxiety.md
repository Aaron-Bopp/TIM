#### [[A secure identity is the best defense against social anxiety]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.topicHeader(dv, this)`

 [[Our brains are built around survival]] and what will increase our fitness ([[Neuroscience]]) and one of those is [[socialization|social fitness]]. If you are able to interact and win favor among other humans you are more likely to pass on your genes which thus increases your [[socialization|social fitness]]. The way that this primal urge manifests in our complex understanding of emotion is in [[self-worth]] and by contradiction [[insecurity]] of [[self]]. ([[Complex emotions are intellectual understandings of primal urges]]) 

 If you are insecure in your [[self]], you may feel levels of [[social discomfort]] during [[socialization]]. Part of this is because any slight to you, any level of ineptitude, or feeling of disapproval has nothing to be respelled by. [[A secure identity is the best defense against social anxiety]], but [[self]] is not always the thing being attacked.

 If you have achieved a high level of [[socialization| social fitness]] you will often be surrounded by people reinforcing your [[self-worth]], but that does not mean you are secure in your [[self]].  Often those who value outside validation the most are the most susceptible to attacks on [[self]], and often they are blind to their own insecurities because their [[socialization]] is valued so highly. 

[[You can be taught to invalidate your own emotions]]
