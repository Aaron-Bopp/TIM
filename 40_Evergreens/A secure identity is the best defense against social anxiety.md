#TO/PONDER/IDEA 
[[Confidence comes when you are more capable of handling diverse outcomes]].
If you have [[confidence]] in your ability to handle awkward situations, understand your own emotions, and have [[empathy]] for other people, you have no reason to feel [[social anxiety]].
[[You can be taught to invalidate your own emotions]]
