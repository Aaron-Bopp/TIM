#### [[Worlds views should be open ended and adaptive]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[The Christian worldview is incompatible with most other worldviews]] because [[Worldviews should not make life seem easy and simple]]. 
As the world continues to change and grow, we see [[Christianity]] starting to clash with modern day perspectives.
^[[[The church will fail if christians keep aligning themselves with hate instead of love]]]
While [[eastern philosophy]] like [[meditation]], [[yoga]], and even [[Buddhism]] become more and more accepted in the west.
This is because these [[worldview]]s broke down [[humanity]] to it's core elements. As we learn more about how the [[body]] and [[mind]] work, we only see more and more evidence for this viewpoints.
^[[[notes_Science of Meditation]]]

Even if your [[worldview]] is open ended and adaptive, it does not always mean that you will be. [[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]], but this kind of [[worldview]] and consistent practice of [[meditation]] can help you separate from the irrationality of your [[ego]] and keep your [[self]] open to new ideas: [[Karma is an open ended system of belief]]
