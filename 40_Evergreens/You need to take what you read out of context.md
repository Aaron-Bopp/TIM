#### [[You need to take what you read out of context]] 

If you are not deconstructing and reconstructing what the author is telling you you are losing so much potential.
You can't just read a book and expect to make all the possible connections the first time through.
Author's should be taking us on the best path through their conclusions,
but it's still only ONE PATH.
This means that
you are able to make connections they couldn't,
because you aren't having to make the connections they are making for you.
However, you aren't going to do this if you only try and understand the relationships they put out for you,
you need to reconstruct their relationships so that you can understand the intricacies that they couldn't communicate.
This will allow you to fully understand the material and make new and unique insights.

This
answers:: [[How to understand what you read]],
in addition to::[[You need to teach yourself what you read]]

[[Evergreen notes]] are the best method for this because
[[Evergreen notes help us bridge the gap between knowledge and understanding]]
