#### [[What is language's fundamental unit]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

If sentences are molecules, words are atoms, vowels are protons, consonants are neutrons, punctuation is electrons, and concatenation is nuclear strong force,
then paragraph's are amino acids, notes are cells, and books are organisms.
[[Evergreen notes]] are like single-celled organisms.
[[knowledge management|Knowledge management systems]] are more complex organisms, and [[AI]]'s are conscious organisms. 

- [[Nodes in the second brain are an abstraction of our first brain]]
- [[We will evolve when we make learning as easy as thinking]]
- [[Note taking is a spectrum from purely reproductive to purely productive]]
- [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]]

Books are paths through evergreen forests
