#### [[What is language's fundamental unit]] 

![[English is six languages in a trenchcoat trying to imitate a working form of communication.#qoute]]

If sentences are molecules, words are atoms, vowels are protons, consonants are neutrons, punctuation is electrons, and concatenation is nuclear strong force,
then paragraph's are amino acids, notes are cells, and books are organisms.
[[Evergreen notes]] are like single-celled organisms.
[[knowledge management|Knowledge management systems]] are more complex organisms, and [[AI]]'s are conscious organisms. 

- [[Nodes in the second brain are an abstraction of our first brain]]
- [[We will evolve when we make learning as easy as thinking]]

Books are paths through evergreen forests: [[What are the different kinds of information in books]].
but sometimes you need to stray off the path: [[You need to take what you read out of context]]

[[Dan Alloso]] thinks that the paragraph is the fundamental unit.
