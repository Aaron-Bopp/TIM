#### [[A inwardly judgmental and outwardly accepting home creates trust issues]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

#TO/TEND/WEED 
When I was a kid I grew up in a very [[religion|religious]] household,
^[[[My Deconstruction journey]]]
and so I was very aware of the consequences of not being a [[Christianity|Christian]].
^[[[Religious concepts are often too powerful for a child's mind]]]
So it was very shocking to me when we would come home from church and I would hear my [[parents]] talk about the people who they had been so nice to at church in such [[judgement|judgmental]] ways. 
This was very confusing for me, and I developed a lot of [[anxiety]] around not being able to trust what my [[parents]] would say.
