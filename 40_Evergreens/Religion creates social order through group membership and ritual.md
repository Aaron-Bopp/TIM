#### [[Religion creates social order through group membership and ritual]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This was proposed by [[Emile Durkheim]] as a [[functionalism|functionalist]] explanation for [[religious belief]].
Religion would support beliefs and practices in line with the sacred 
^[**sacred** - worthy of respect or dedication ]
and spurn ones related with the profane
^[**profane** - corrupt morally or by intemperance or sensuality]
and would in this way create the group cohesiveness needed for [[social order]].

Durkheim felt that emotional catharsis of emotional rituals such as this one in Gabon would both encourage group membership and increase group cohesion, and those familiar with the culture such as [[Malidoma Patrice Some]] said ritual was an inseparable aspect of maintaining social [[responsibility]].
