- part of:: [[What maintains our social order]]
- explained by:: [[Symbolism increases human's capacity for cooperation]]
- explains:: [[Religion promotes high social control]]

Religion would support beliefs and practices in line with the sacred

^[**profane** - corrupt morally or by intemperance or sensuality]
and would in this way create the group cohesiveness needed for [[social order]].
