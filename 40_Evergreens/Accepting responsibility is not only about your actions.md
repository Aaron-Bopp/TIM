#### [[Accepting responsibility is not only about your actions]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Sometimes accepting responsibility for something means accepting the responsibility of fixing it. Accepting responsibility for things outside of your control does not have anything to do with the actions. Actions cannot be reversed, nor can they often be rectified. Accepting responsibility means acknowledging why the event happened, what it did to you, and what it did to other people. This can mean accepting responsibility for moving past your [[trauma]], the needs of others being pushed upon you, or the sins of your ancestors that you still benefit from.  This means that [[Working through trauma can involve of a lot of letting go]]

Accepting responsibility is about moving forward for yourself and for the people affected by the event. In [[Germany]] they accept responsibility for Holocaust, despite no living person having taken part in it. They teach it in schools and are very serious about taking responsibility for it. This is not because they support or caused the actions of the Holocaust it's because they realize their part in it, their part in fixing it. American's need to have the same stance on slavery.

Accepting responsibility for these kind of things is not taught at a young age in [[America]] because that goes against [[individualism]].
