#### [[Accepting responsibility is not only about your actions]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

%%I wish I could have ancestors that I'm proud of. I wish I could look back and see [[culture]] and history that I could draw from. But I can't. #TO/PONDER/ME %%
Accepting responsibility means acknowledging why something happened, what it did to you, and what it did to other people.
Accepting responsibility for this may not have anything to do with your actions,
both because they might not have been yours, or because you just can't change the past.
Sometimes accepting responsibility for something means accepting the responsibility of fixing it, even if you had no part in it

Accepting responsibility is about moving forward for yourself and for the people affected by the event. In [[Germany]] they accept responsibility for Holocaust, despite no living person having taken part in it. They teach it in schools and are very serious about taking responsibility for it. This is not because they support or caused the actions of the Holocaust it's because they realize their part in it, and their part in fixing it.
American's need to have the same stance on slavery.

In [[eastern philosophy]] this is the idea of [[karma]]. The actions and reactions that have lead to where you are at this very moment. 
^[Don't confuse this for any moral claim, [[karma]] is just an observation of reality: [[Karma is based in the law of cause and effect]]]
In turn, your [[duty]] or [[Dharma]] is related to your [[karma]].
It does not matter if the actions that lead you to this point were yours or your ancestors, they are out of your control. 
What you are in control of is your action in the current moment.
Your [[duty]] is to accept [[responsibility]] and take action.

This doesn't mean you can rectify your past actions in the eyes of other people. You are entitled to the act of taking [[responsibility]], but not to anybodies forgiverness.
^[This is the idea of [[Karma Fal]]: [[you can't]]]



[[When should you forgive people who don't deserve it]]
[[Be the change you want to see in the world]]
This can mean accepting responsibility for moving past your [[trauma]], the needs of others being pushed upon you, or the sins of your ancestors that you still benefit from.  


Accepting responsibility for these kind of things is not taught at a young age in [[America]] because that goes against [[individualism]]: [[You will never be pushed to understand marginalization unless you are part of a marginalized group]]
