#### [[An unfulfilled need for validation results in a fear of rejection]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

We seek out validation from other's because it reinforces our [[self-perception]]. 
If we don't have a strong sense of [[self-image]] or [[self-love|self-worth]],
then we are going to seek out validation even more,
and if we are repeatedly not getting validation or are getting invalidated,
then we are going to start fearing that rejection,
especially if we don't have a [[support]] system to fall back on.
This is how so many people get stuck in unhealthy situations because they have no intrinsic sense of [[self-love|self-worth]] and they are too scared to lose any that they might have.

In some cases this can get bad enough to be considered [[Rejection Sensitivity]] disorder, which is often comorbid with [[ADHD]] or [[Autism]], or with a history of [[trauma]].
