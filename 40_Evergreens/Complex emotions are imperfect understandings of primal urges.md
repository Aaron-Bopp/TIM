Emotional responses are built into our [[biology]] but are seen through the lense of our daily lives.
This is a logical approach as [[Biological processes can only give context to behavior not predict it]],
but our genetic context cannot be ignored.
^[This may be seen as a controversial conclusion of [[Evolutionary Psychology]], but this can be a valid [[framework]]: [[Evolutionary Psychology is just a framework not a prescription of behavior]]]

What is [[existential dread]] other than a complex understanding our fear of death? 

What is [[Humans love to group eachother|humans love for grouping eachother]] other than a complex understanding of [[natural selection|kin selection]]?

What is [[The brain is powerful enough to create supernatural experiences]] but a function of [[Belief can motivate adaptation]]?

We are more complex than any other animal. We have developed a [[consciousness]] that is the essence of what makes us human, but our inexplicable instincts are still at play,
leading to:: [[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things]]

part of:: [[Humans are a product of evolution]]
