### Season 1
- Timeline: 2929-2933
- Main Characters: Ecthelion II and his wife, Arathorn II and Gilraen, Elrond, Elrohir, Elladan, Gandalf, Saruman
- Plot: 
	- We get to see the births of Aragorn and Denethor and Denethor's sisters. 
	- Ecthelion is sent by Turgon to clear Umbar of Corsairs. Ecthelion does this by brokering a treatise with the Haradrim as they have also been dealing with Corsair raids. Saruman is instrumental in this and for his help is given Isengard.
	- Arathorn is the leader of the Dúnedain and is dealing with orc and troll raids from the North. Arathorn clashes with Elrond as he wishes to make a claim for the throne of Gondor. He thinks that they should provide more soldiers for the North. Elrond obviously opposes this as he has foreseen that Arathorn's son will instead be the future leader. This is resolved by Elrond contributing more elves to the defense of Eriador, including his two sons.

### Season 2
- Timeline: 2953-2963-65 with a ten year time jump in the middle
- Main Characters: Ecthelion and his wife, Denethor, Finduilas, Morwen Steelsheen, Thengel, Aragorn, Gilraen, Elrond, Gandalf
- Plot:
	- Two years prior Sauron has openly declared himself in Mordor. Turgon has refused to ackowledge this as legitimate, believing it a poser. There is strife between Ecthelion and Turgon over this.
	- Thengel is in Gondor and has become close with Denethor. Little bit of a love triangle between Thengel, Denethor, and Finduilas as they are all staying in Dol Amroth. 
	- A plague is making its way through Gondor and Rohan. This is why Thengel and Denethor are in Dol Amroth. Ecthelion is still in Minas Tirith because Turgon's health is already not very good. This plague will take Turgon and Fengel causing Ecthelion and Thengel to take their leadership positions early. Thengel's time in Gondor and his Gondorian wife means that he will seem more Gondorian than Rhohirric. Meanwhile Denethor stays in Dol Amroth, enjoying a peaceful life.
		- Alternatively Thengel is just in Gondor because he dislikes his father and Turgon sends Denethor there because he is in denial about Sauron's return
		- It could be fun to match Turgon's death with the eruption of Orodruin
	- At the start of the season Aragorn will still be unaware of his liniege. Gandalf will push Elrond to reveal it while Elrond is hesitant due to Arathorn's hastiness. Gilraen will also be involved in this matter but for much more personal reasons. This will resolve in Aragorn being told, and going to lead the Rangers in the North for a time.
	- Here we jump ten years forward. The plague has mostly resolved, but Gondor and especially Rohan's populations will be severely hurt. Easterlings will be preparing to take advantage of this. Gandalf makes Elrond and Aragorn aware of this. It is decided that Aragorn should ride south but under pseudonym. 
	- In Rohan we see Thengel and his children preparing for war against the Easterlings. Thorongil is a greatly received addition as he is an excellent fighter and an even stronger leader. 
	- In Gondor the corsairs have made a resurgence as due to the plague Gondor has not been able to be as vigilant. This weakens their allyship with Harad, so Ecthelion sends Denethor to repair this. Denethor fails in this as his easy upbringing in Dol Amroth has not prepared him for dealings with the hardened Haradrim.
### Season 3
- Timeline: 2965
- Main Characters: Ecthelion, Thorongil, Denetho
- Plot:
	- Thorongil turns south after victory against the Easterlings. He begins to serve under Ecthelion as orcs attacks from Mordor start again. 
	
### Season 4
- Timeline: 2970
- Main Characters: 
- Plot:
	- After his victory against the Corsairs, Aragorn turns the east and south and travels for years in these lands "learning the hearts of men." While it said that he travels alone often, it is also said that he forges a strong friendship with Gandalf. 
		- Ideas for these plots
			- Encounter dark sorcery
			- Encounter Avari who never went west from Cuivienen
			- Learn in the arts of healing
			- Walk in disguise among the slaves of Nurnen
			- Encounter and possibly ride and Oliphant
			- Learn different styles of fighting
			- Aragorn could save someone who then feels like they owe him a life debt and follows him around for a time
		- There is a chance that these plots could feel very disconnected to the rest of the show, but I still think it could be done well
			- Sauron is the obvious point to connect these plots to the main story. He would be extending his influence through the south and east and eventually that could be what pushes Aragorn back.
			- The other reason they feel disconnected is that Aragorn never really makes reference to them. We would want to add callbacks to this time throughout the rest of the show, as well as possibly having some running storylines with people Aragorn meets. This would also allow us to show the fall of these people, that even though their is good in them they still side with Sauron.
		- We also want to avoid creating a white savior, or disrespecting Asian and African cultures in the process.
			- We can avoid this with Aragorn through careful crafting of his story, but the issue also comes up with the macro events of the War of the Ring itself. I think we would want to show that only a small portion of the Haradrim and the Easterlings actually come and fight with Sauron.
			- We should show that the south and east are vast and diverse cultures, and that if not for Sauron and the Corsairs would have vibrant relations with the West. We could even talk of a silk road type scenario that existed in the past, but was cut off through the actions of the Nazgul and later Sauron in Mordor.
			- The reason that none of these benevolent rulers in the south would get involved in the War should be due to lack of communication rather than lack of care.

### Season 5
- Plots: 
	- Mouth of Sauron Origin - It would be cool to make the Mouth and Gondorian character that we know and that his first great act for Sauron is betraying Ecthelion.
