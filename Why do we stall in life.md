#### [[Why do we stall in life]]

part of:: [[How to pursue the positive things in life]]

Statistically it seems likely that
[[The most reliable path to success is repeatedly trying to succeed]]
might be true, but it is hard for us to recognize this especially when we believe 
[[Sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion]].

[[Buddhism]] might suggest that the key is in having the right thoughts, 
because [[Right kinds of thoughts lead to right kinds of actions]].
In this case, [[meditation]] will be one of your key practices:: [[Meditation is a practice to gain control over your thoughts]].

For some the key might be telling them that [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]]. If they want to look at the problems of the world objectively they also have to look at the solutions.

Perhaps you can tell them [[Humans have decided to reject an unjust world]] and that [[Communities are support systems]], but if they are already struggling to find a [[community]] this may be unhelpful.

Maybe the solution is to give up on [[optimism]] and rely on [[hope]]. [[Hope is not optimism it is a practice for producing change]] has hardened many [[marginalized]] people survive and thrive under [[oppression]].

Perhaps there is nothing that you can do because [[We are confined to the tools of our time]].
In this case wait and hope for the epiphany that [[Happiness is enlightenment and sadness is delusion]] 
and that they need to [[Be the change you want to see in the world]].`
