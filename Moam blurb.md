#### [[Moam blurb]]

Hermione was sitting in Draco's laps, her head on his chest with his arms around her. This position was new but felt as shockingly natural as every other intimate moment they had shared so far. They had just finished the discussing the rules for their courtship and were sitting quietly in the comfort of their new officiality. Suddenly a new thought popped into her head as Hermione thought of yet another edge case, but she lifted herself slowly of his chest to avoid a third scowl from Draco. 

"What is it?" Draco's lips were formed into a slight frown, but the brightness of his eyes showed that his momentary aggravation would not override his brimming happiness.

"Perhaps, _Draco_, since we're discussing rules, you should call me Hermione

"I could." Draco inclined his head as if considering it. "But I like Granger. Nobody else says it quite as well as I do"

Hermione rolled her eyes so far back that she her head fell back and a half-groan half-laugh escaped. She brought her back to see Draco's smirk as he stared at her.
