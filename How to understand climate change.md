#### [[How to understand climate change]]

##### Put average temperature into perspective

[[Small changes in average global temperature have exponential effects ]]

[[Global warming isn't consistent]]

1. Understand everything as percentage of 51 billion - the amount of emissions that we emit per year as of 2019
2. We need net-zero emissions - we won't be able to get rid of all greenhouse gas emission, but we need to reduce it to the point that we can extract the remaining emission
3. Understand how much energy is need for what - [[killowatt]] == house, [[gigawatt]] == city, 100+ gigawatts  == big countries
