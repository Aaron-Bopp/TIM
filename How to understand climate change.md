##### Warming isn't consistent

> ![[books_How to Avoid a Climate Disaster#^306587585]]

[[Greenhouse gases absord only specific wavelengths of energy]]
[[Climate change increases the likelyhood of extreme weather events]]
[[Clean electricity solves a lot of problems]]

1. Understand everything as percentage of 51 billion - the amount of emissions that we emit per year as of 2019
2. We need net-zero emissions - we won't be able to get rid of all greenhouse gas emission, but we need to reduce it to the point that we can extract the remaining emission
3. Understand how much energy is need for what - [[killowatt]] == house, [[gigawatt]] == city, 100+ gigawatts  == big countries
