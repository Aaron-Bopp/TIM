1. Understand everything as percentage of [[51 billion]] - the amount of emissions that we emit per year as of 2019
2. We need net-zero emissions - we won't be able to get rid of all greenhouse gas emission, but we need to reduce it to the point that we can extract the remaining emission
3. Understand how much energy is need for what - [[kilowatt]] == house, [[gigawatt]] == city, 100+ gigawatts == big countries
