> 
> Monotheism is the belief that there is only one deity, an all-supreme being that is universally referred to as God. 
> 
> A distinction may be made between exclusive monotheism, in which the one God is a singular existence, and both inclusive and pluriform monotheism, in which multiple gods or godly forms are recognized, but each are postulated as extensions of the same God.
