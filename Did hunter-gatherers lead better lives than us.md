#### [[Did hunter-gatherers lead better lives than us]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This has been a question since [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]] and has survived to this day as the myth of the [[noble savage]].

Today this is a combination of this idea that [[hunter-gatherers]] were primarily egalitarian
^[Almost certainly not true: [[Hunter-gatherer societies were very diverse]] but still a common question [[Were hunter-gatherer societies egalitarian]]]
and a newer idea spawned by [[Neuroscience]],
that since [[Our biology has not significantly changed for thousands of years]] our brains would be more accustomed to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.
