#### [[Emotions are how our brain stores thought processes]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

- [[emergence]]
- [[Our brain actively inhibits us from processing repressed emotions]]
- [[Complex emotions are imperfect understandings of primal urges]]
- [[Triggers are stored interactions that lead to strong emotional responses]]

or perhaps more accurately they are how we store strings of sensory inputs
aka [[Samskara]]s

That gut feeling is a symbolization of past thought.

That trigger is a symbolization of all your past fears

[[What is the cognitive origin of our social order]]
