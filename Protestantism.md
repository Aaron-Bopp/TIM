#### <s class="topic-title">[[Protestantism]]</s>

> [!wikipedia] [Protestantism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism)
> 
> Protestantism began in Germany in 1517, when Martin Luther published his Ninety-five Theses as a reaction against abuses in the sale of indulgences by the Catholic Church, which purported to offer the remission of the temporal punishment of sins to their purchasers. 
> 
> Today, Protestantism constitutes the second-largest form of [[Christianity]] (after [[Catholicism]]), with a total of 800 million to 1 billion adherents worldwide or about 37% of all Christians.  
> 
> Protestantism is diverse, being more divided theologically and ecclesiastically than the Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodoxy or Oriental Orthodoxy. A majority of Protestants are members of a handful of Protestant denominational families: Adventists, Anabaptists, Anglicans/Episcopalians, Baptists, [[Calvinism|Calvinist]]/Reformed, Lutherans, Methodists,  Nondenominational, [[Charistmaticism|Charismatic]], Independent, and other churches are on the rise, and constitute a significant part of Protestantism.

Protestantism is often confused with [[Evangelicalism]]. 
While both are inter-denominational and have large amounts of overlap, Protestantism is a predecessors of [[Evangelicalism]] and most evangelicals would be considered Protestants.

> Protestants originating in the Reformation reject the Roman Catholic doctrine of papal supremacy, but disagree among themselves regarding the number of sacraments, the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, and matters of ecclesiastical polity and apostolic succession. 
> 
> They emphasize the priesthood of all believers; justification by faith alone (sola fide) rather than by faith with good works; the teaching that salvation comes by divine grace or "unmerited favor" only, not as something merited (sola gratia); and either affirm the Bible as being the sole highest authority (sola scriptura "scripture alone") or primary authority (prima scriptura "scripture first") for Christian doctrine, rather than being on parity with sacred tradition.
