#### <s class="topic-title">[[Zoroastrianism]]</s>

At it's core a [[dualism|dualistic]] [[religion]], Zoroastrianism likely contributed to many of the dualistic qualities of [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]].

> [!wikipedia] [Zoroastrianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism)
> 
> Zoroastrianism or Mazdayasna is an Iranian religion and one of the world's oldest continuously-practiced organized faiths, based on the teachings of the Iranian-speaking prophet Zoroaster.
> 
> Recent estimates place the current number of Zoroastrians in the world at around 110,000–120,000 at most, with the majority of this figure living in India, Iran, and North America; their number has been thought to be declining.
> 
> Historically, the unique features of Zoroastrianism, such as its [[monotheism]], messianism, belief in [[free will]] and [[judgment]] after death, conception of heaven, hell, angels, and demons, among other concepts, may have influenced other religious and philosophical systems, including the Abrahamic religions and Gnosticism, Northern Buddhism, and Greek philosophy.
> 
> With possible roots dating back to the 2nd millennium BCE, Zoroastrianism enters recorded history around the middle of the 6th century BCE. 
> 

> [!wikipedia]- Theology
> 
> Zoroaster proclaimed that Ahura Mazda was the supreme creator, the creative and sustaining force of the universe through Asha, and that human beings are given a choice between supporting Ahura Mazda or not, making them ultimately responsible for their choices. 
> 
> The life force that originates from Ahura Mazda, known as Asha (truth, cosmic order), stands in opposition to Druj (falsehood, deceit). Ahura Mazda is considered to be all-good with no evil emanating from the deity. Ahura Mazda works in gētīg (the visible material realm) and mēnōg (the invisible spiritual and mental realm).
>
> Zoroastrianism is not entirely uniform in theological and philosophical thought, especially with historical and modern influences having a significant impact on individual and local beliefs, practices, values and vocabulary, sometimes merging with tradition and in other cases displacing it. 
>

> [!wikipedia]- Beliefs
> 
> The ultimate purpose in the life of a practicing Zoroastrian is to become an ashavan (a master of Asha) and to bring happiness into the world, which contributes to the cosmic battle against evil. The core teachings of Zoroastrianism include:
> 
> - Following the threefold path of Asha: Humata, Hūxta, Huvarshta (lit. 'good thoughts, good words, good deeds').
> - Practicing charity to keep one's soul aligned with Asha and thus with spreading happiness.
> - The spiritual equality and duty of men and women alike.
> - Being good for the sake of goodness and without the hope of reward (see Ashem Vohu).
