**Introduction:**

To those reading this short story with little or no knowledge of the ancient times of Tolkien's world, this might confuse you. But don't get confuzzled by all the names just focus on the story and that will make it much more enjoyable. But you should know the Valar are the Gods of middle and people like Alatar, Curumo, and Olorin are Maiar and are basically angels.

**The Story of the Istari's coming into Middle-Earth**

Curumo and Alatar stood before the Valar. These two Maiar were not friends nor were they acquainted with each other, but they had been called before the counsel of the Valar together. Each served a different Valar. Alatar served the valar Oromë, and was a great maker of traps. He spent his time wandering the woods in the south of Aman. Curumo on the other hand gave little heed to forests and woodlands for he was most often in the smith halls of Aul. He spent his time creating beautiful things. Alatar was not used to being in the high Valinorean court but Curumo seemed quite at ease. Curumo was of very high stature in Valimar and valued very highly by Aulë. Alatar, while one of the closest to the Valar Oromë, rarely came to the city of the Valar. But Alatar was not stupid or slovenly, he was elegant as an old tree in a young forest. He was very loved by Oromë and when Oromë received word that three Maiar must go to Middle-earth on a very important task he had brought Alatar with him. Now Alatar, as it seemed, would be travelling to Arda to help its peoples not be overcome by the evil Maiar called Sauron. Oromë, who wandered middle-earth more than any other Valar, had consulted much with Manwe, and together they have now determined that the peoples of Middle-Earth were too weak to stand against Sauron. Therefore three Maiar were to go and help the children of Middle-earth.

"Where is Olórin," asked Manwë, "I requested that he be here," and then as if on queue Olórin the healer came bustling into the great hall of the Valar. Olórin looked rather shabby as if he had been rushed in getting up this morning. He was wearing a silver-grey cloak. His hair was windblown and uncombed. His face was tired but not bored, and his eyes carried the light that came to all that lived in the undying lands.

"My apologies great Manwë but I was held up in my journey from the south. One of the great eagles had gotten stuck in a web at the feet of Hyarmentir so I took a day to see her well." Olórin has said this all in a rush, and it took a moment for Manwë to respond.

"Olórin, it is now time for you to take on a greater task than that you have here. We have now seen need to send protection for the peoples of Arda against Melkor\'s great servant Sauron."

"Oh my lord, I am not worthy to go in the company of those as Maiar such as these. I, a simple wanderer, could not do such a thing as this. I am weak among the Maiar and could not stand up to that most powerful servant." Now something must be said for Olórin's timidness. A great tragedy had befallen him that must be accounted for. When Melkor the Dark Lord was gathering his servants Sauron had went to Olórin and had tried to seduce him to Melkor. Then in an attempt to try and warn the Valar of Melkor\'s doings Olórin had gone along with Sauron and ended up face to face with the dark lord Melkor. When Olórin tried to escape Melkor cursed him and berieved him of much of his power. The eagles of Manwë had found Olórin with his spirit nearly gone from this world and as they carried him back to the halls of Manwë they weeped, for Olórin was a great friend of the eagles. Though Manwë had revived Olórin he had never reachieved his full potential and remained very susceptible to the darkness of Melkor.

"Olórin, it is you that must do this, you must be the third messenger," as Manwë was about to continue Varda had raised her hand requesting silence. She was Manwë's greatest counselor but she had remained quiet at this meeting.

"Not as the third," she said and then slowly lowering her hand and the distant thoughtful look that she always wore returned to her face. Suddenly Yavanna who had also stayed quiet on this issue piped up and said,

"If there are to be more, then you must send dear Aiwendil with them."

"Let there be five," said Mandos, "for I have seen that five shall go as messengers of light to this world."

"Pallando will go," said Oromë, "As a friend of Alatar, and one of my greatest hunters."

"Then it is done, Curumo, you shall lead this quest into middle-earth, but all of you must not put yourselves in power over the free peoples of middle-earth. Though you are peers of Sauron you must keep your power hidden. You are to guide the firstborn and the second-born so that they may defeat the dark servant Sauron. You shall take the form of mortal men so as to disguise yourselves for a time. Curumo, you must go before the sun rises in the east and the rest shall leave before the moon rises a fortnight from now.

Alatar, Pallando, Olorin and Aiwendil stood at the docks of the grey havens as the ship they had arrived on slowly melted back into the sea. The four Istari had arrived in the land of middle-earth. Ulmo had told them that he would take them to a haven of the elves of Beleriand. Curumo had come weeks earlier in order to prepare for their arrival. All was quiet in the beautiful bay. High cliffs rose on either side to create the feeling that they were in a giant basin. All along the cliffs grew trees with golden leaves and houses nestled in between. These houses were nothing compared to the halls of the valar but the architecture seemed reminiscent to that of the Teleri. They flowed like leaves and tree branches but they still seemed sturdy. They all had balconies or a window looking out at the see for the Teleri loved the see and the sound of the waves.

Suddenly out of the archway to their right came Curumo and with him was a tall elf. It was with a start that Alatar noticed how frail Curumo looked and then as he looked at his companions he realized that they all looked like that, and some of them even worse. Manwe had told them they would be in the form of mortals but he had never imagined they would look as sorry as this. Alatar silently stepped over to the edge of the dock and looked at his reflection in the water. He had lost the golden hue of Aman. His skin no longer radiated with light of the golden land. His skin looked dry and cold, and his hair as dead grass. But there was one thing that looked familiar, if you looked closely you could see that there was still light in his eyes. A light that would guide many through the perilous times ahead.

"So, what of Sauron," said Alatar. They were now sitting in a small, circular room with a balcony looking over the bay. The ceiling was vaulted to a point and there was a door on either side of the room. One lead to a small sleeping chamber where Curumo had apparently been staying. The other lead out onto a walkway with several attached rooms. They were sitting around a low table that looked as if it had been carved from a singular piece of wood.

"I do not believe he has yet started to regain his power but he is alive. Looming at the edge of thought. The alliance of men and elves is weak, they cannot withstand Sauron at his full strength. But there is one provision that may help us, the ring of sauron is not found and hopefully it will be lost forever." Cirdan's face was calm but it seemed that there was something heavy weighing on him.

"Lost? Should it not have been destroyed. Was not Sauron destroyed and this ring taken from him." Aiwendil spoke with much fervency. "Who is it that then tarried to destroy this ring and Sauron with it?" At that point everyone seemed to stop breathing. the air was still and the room was silent.

"It was a man," Cirdan spoke gravely, "His name was Isildur, son of Elendil. He cut the ring from Sauron's hand and as soon as he touched the ring it took control of him. Elrond flagbearer of Gil-Galad took Isildur to the cracks of Mount Doom but Isildur refused. He refused to destroy the ring. He took it with him back to Gondor. Then one day, as he was riding through Itilien, he was besieged by orcs. No one knows the exact tale but they found his body on the banks of the Anduin and the ring was lost."

"So it is lost, we need not worry," said Curumo.

"Lost, yes, but not destroyed. What if it is found? What if it falls into the hands of the enemy?" Olorin spoke as if he was angry but you could hear fear in his voice.

"The Anduin is deep, and it leads to the sea. Most likely the ring of power has been washed out into Ulmo's Domain." Curumo's reply seemed to sate Olorin. Cirdan still seemed uneasy but he did not voice his opinions. "Nevertheless, Sauron is still alive and he will return. Though he cannot reach his former glory he will terrorize this world if we do not stop him. For now we must go out into this world and learn of it\--"

"But first will you not come and eat with us," said Cirdan, his voice light and happy as if the name of Sauron had never been mentioned in this room. There was a general murmur of assent in the room though it seemed like Curumo would have them leave that very night.

"Wonderful, please make yourself at home while I inform the others." With that Cirdan left the room, his cloak flowing behind him.

"It's so stuffy in here," said Aiwendil, "I must go find a garden,"

The feast hall was a glorious thing. Its walls curved to create the ceiling and met a point. At regular intervals there were pillars that looked to be living tree, but without leaves or branches. They all met at the highest point in the ceiling and from there hung a beautiful chandelier made from woven glass. It was so intricate that you could not find the source of the light. Beneath it there were long tables made of cedar wood with chairs made of oak. Finally, opposite the entrance was the great table, carved from a great mallorn tree and gilded with silver. Olorin was there talking with Cirdan, Curumo was brewing and the corner, and Aiwendil was talking with some elves that looked like they had just been come from a garden. The room was already full with happy elves and as Alatar and Pallando walked in Cirdan stood and said, "Now that all our guests have arrived, let the feast begin!" With that the company dug into the large fish platters and assortment of garden plants. It was a happy and joyous night of eating and drinking and merriment. The elves took very keenly to Olorin and Curumo, they gave name of Curinir to Curumo, which means man of skill, for he told them of all the beautiful things he had made in his homeland. Olorin and Cirdan talked long at the great table that night. In the morning after most had gone to bed but few had awakened again Olorin set out. He was arrayed in grey when he left and it gave Alatar the feeling that Aman was even farther away. The next few days passed quickly as the four remaining wizards planned for the journey ahead. It was decided that Alatar and Pallando would head south through dunland and into the kingdom of Gondor from there they would head west to travel the lands of Rhun and Nirnen and prepare their people for the return of Sauron. Curumo or Curunir as they now called him would head west from the grey havens to Rivendell where it was said many wise elves still lived. Aiwendil had decided to travel north to Lindon from which he would head west through the wilderness.

The sun rose on the small glen in which they had spent the night. The grass was wet with dew and there were birds chirping in the trees. Pallando must have already gone to get water because he was nowhere to be seen. They were just east of the North-South road south of the land called Dunland. It had been just three weeks since they had left the Grey Havens. They had first traveled east through the tower hills before the road turned south. They had passed through a quaint land called the Shire but it had been night so they did not see much of the folk that lived there. Alatar sat up and brushed himself off his journey had just begun and this world was still new to him. Already he could see the evil crevices of this world but that was why they had been sent here. The world would not fall under his watch.

The sun rose on the small glen in which they had spent the night. The grass was wet with dew and there were birds chirping in the trees. Pallando must have already gone to get water because he was nowhere to be seen. They were just east of the North-South road south of the land called Dunland. It had been just three weeks since they had left the Grey Havens. They had first traveled east through the tower hills before the road turned south. They had passed through a quaint land called the Shire but it had been night so they did not see much of the folk that lived there. Alatar sat up and brushed himself off as he was wrapping up his blanket Pallando came back into the glen.
