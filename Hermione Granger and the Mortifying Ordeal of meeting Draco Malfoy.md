#### [[Hermione Granger and the Mortifying Ordeal of meeting Draco Malfoy]]

##### Blurb

The text includes the entirety of the original story, with the only removals being of descriptive text of Hermione's actions that have been replaced by her own internal monologue. Most of the additions have been made around dialogue to explain Hermione's banter in the way that Draco's is. This is without a doubt a worse piece of writing than the original, as Hermione's extremely verbose internal monologue upsets the pacing of the story and is often out of place. The main reason this story exists is because as I read this story I would stop multiple times per chapter to imagine what Hermione was thinking, and personally thought it added to the story. If you thought that Draco's "quashing" was bad wait until you read Hermione's incessant overthinking and rationalization of her emotions. However I still recommend you read the original first as knowing Hermione's intentions removes a certain level of intrigue in the story, and makes quite of a few of the surprise moments less surprising. 

##### Chapter 13

“_Monsieur_’s dessert selection?”

“What she’s having,” said Draco.

“_Une crème caramel pour Monsieur Crotch_,” said the waiter, inscribing this precious information upon his notepad with care.

Granger touched eyes with Draco. She held a hand to her mouth.

The waiter left.

Granger squeaked out a giggle, struggled to control it, took a large breath, and was still.

“Hormone,” said Draco.

Granger collapsed into a fit of uncontrollable giggling.

“I told you not to do that,” she gasped, coming back up for air.

“There is something gratifying about making you utterly lose it.”

Granger sniffed and dabbed at her lashes with a napkin. “It’s a rare sight, I hope you’re appreciating it.”

“I am,” said Draco.

And he was. Granger’s dark eyes were bright with laughter. Her cheeks were flushed, her lips were reddened by wine. Her hair in its loose plait snaked down to her waist, a dark line against her white sundress. Her legs were curled under her; she looked dainty and fragile, and small enough to fit perfectly into a man's lap, if a man were thinking about such things. (Draco certainly wasn't.)

And the candlelight loved her. It kissed at her forehead and flickered warm touches across her collarbone. It danced in her eyes.

The effect was enchanting.

Draco sank, unaware, into a state of soft fascination.

An accordionist began to play, somewhere near the hotel, filling the air with romance.

“_Monsieur_, your crème caramel.”

The return to reality was jarring.

“_Merci_,” said Draco, instead of _sod the fucking crème caramel._

Granger was eating her dessert, blissfully unaware of Draco’s reverie, thank the gods. He decided to blame the wine for making him such a daft, moon-eyed cretin tonight. That and too few recent shags, clearly, if he was going to faff off and daydream about Granger, of all of the witches in his life.

It would help if she didn’t look like a lovely Grecian dryad tonight, about to join Artemis’ retinue.

Since when was Granger beautiful?

What an aggravating development.

“Are you all right?” asked Granger.

“Why?” asked Draco, injecting some irritation into the syllable, to sound Absolutely Normal.

“You’ve hardly touched your dessert,” said Granger, gesturing to Draco’s crème caramel with her spoon. “Rather uncharacteristic.”

There were other things going on that were rather uncharacteristic, but if that was the only one that the Brain was catching on to, that was fine by Draco.

“I’m savouring it,” said Draco. He took a slow bite to demonstrate. 

*Did he just lick lips?* Surely not but as Draco belaboured the spoon towards his mouth Hermione's eyes suddenly fixated on the glint of sun on his pale lips.

Granger’s eyebrow twitched. “Stop that.”

“Stop what?” asked Draco.

Hermione's stomach dropped in the way that she mad become maddeningly familiar with around Malfoy. Thankfully the sarcasm she used to deal with this feeling was becoming almost second nature. 

“Being indecent with the spoon.”

“I am using the spoon. Anything else is a figment of your imagination.”

Hermione narrowed her eyes at him. She'd learned that looking was rarely helpful in these situations, as it usually just resulted in her fight or flight disengaging usually just resulted with a small flush of her cheeks that she so despised. As Hermione cast around for another response Draco took another slow bite, maintaining an obnoxious level of eye contact. This time a small shudder ran through Hermione in... repulsion. Right? Hermione looked away as her mind immediately replayed the moment she had just seen. Draco's darting out his mouth catch a bit of caramel leaking down his lips. This had to be on purpose, Draco was never that careless with his food.

“Now you aren’t eating yours,” pointed out Draco.

Finally Hermione's mind provided a useful thought. The image of Draco's tongue was quickly supplanted with with one of the most disgusting Hermione knew, Ron and Lavender snogging. Now Hermione's stomach actually started to churn.

“I’ve quite lost my appetite, watching you snog the cutlery.” 

“You aren’t going to finish?”

“No. Do you want it?” Hermione started to reach for her plate to hand it to him, readying her Ron and Lavender based mental barrier for the coming test.

“I’d rather you choke it down and have strength for the monastery. If the nuns get shirty, tomorrow could be rather strenuous, magically speaking.”

Hermione started to examine this thought. Draco wasn't wrong, it was definitely going to be a strenuous day, but she doubted that the desert would be all that helpful. The sugars in the desert would only give her a short term burst of energy, followed by a small crash. If she wanted to catch up on the curse-breaking book she would need to study right after dinner and this would not be helpful. Of course sugar was seemingly also an important part of casting magic. Magical strength was definitely not drawn from the same place as physical strength but there were some similarities. Hermione had long hypothesized that the glucose in sugar was a major part of the equation and that things like wizard chocolate were extra laden with it. But this was neither a wizard desert nor was she any where near a state of magical exhaustion, and the extra sugar from this desert would be almost completely removed from her system by tomorrow. No there was no point in eating this desert she would just leave it. It wouldn't be rude she had obviously tried it and payed for it. 

Hermione went to push her plate away when she noticed it was empty and that she was currently carrying the last bite her mouth.

*Drat*

Draco found himself observing Hermione now with as she now enthusiastically finished her créme caramel. When he had first met her, in long-ago January, he had been struck by the exhausted thinness that had made her face severe and gaunt. It seemed to him that she had a slightly healthier mien, now – but only slightly. She was a little less bony, a little rosier in the cheeks.

Granger gestured to the waiter for the bill. “_L’addition, s’il vous plaît._”

Her raised arm made Draco realise that her dress had left her arms bare, something that Granger’s choice of attire normally trended against. And now, precisely because it was trying not to catch his attention, her left forearm caught his attention – there was a Notice-Me-Not charm there.

He deliberately looked at the table next door, allowing Granger and her arm to slip into his peripheral vision. There: a blur across the skin of her inner arm.

He realised what the glamour was covering with a sickening plummeting sensation in his stomach. A vivid memory returned, of Bellatrix’s handiwork, stark against Granger’s skin. Of Granger, limp and wrought-out, lying like a dead thing on the drawing room floor. Of the blood oozing out of the fresh-carved letters.

Draco had never used the word Mudblood again, after that.

Now there was something terribly sorrowful in Granger’s habit of wearing long sleeves. In the discreet glamour that she’d cast to be able to wear a pretty dress. Draco hid his own inner arm shame from the world, but he would’ve thought that Granger, of all people, would’ve been able to heal hers away. Clearly, she still bore the mark of Bellatrix’s knife.

“Malfoy?”

Draco blinked. “Hm?”

“You’ve gone quiet.” 

Granger had settled the bill with Muggle money. She was rising from her chair.

Draco rose with her. “Just thinking about tomorrow.”

Hermione wondered if he had also been contemplating the underpinnings of magic on a biological level. As she reached for her normal money she realized how stupid this thought was. *He doesn't even know glucose's molecular structure you dolt.*

As Draco followed Hermione out he returned to what he had actually been thinking about: a distant yesterday, when this witch had been mutilated in the halls of his home. She still bore the scar, and she hid it, from him, and from everyone, but it was still _there_. A daily reminder for her, of cruelty and sick hate. Of how close she’d come to death. Of how near their world had come to a point of no return.

He wished to say something to her – words of sorrow, or of apology – but such words did not come easily to him, and he couldn’t see such a conversation go anywhere but difficult, awkward places.

As they weaved their way through tables back off the wharf, Draco concluded that this was not quite the moment. But, watching the blur of the glamour brush against her skirts as she walked, he determined that there would be A Moment, and he would find the words. Not tonight, but some night.

The sun was finally setting, languidly, lazily, on this gorgeous evening, Midsummer less a day.

Granger was looking wistfully along the rocky beach. “There’s meant to be a marker along there, where the Magdalene would’ve first set foot in France.”

“I suppose that was on your itinerary?”

“It was, but I ran out of time.”

“Let’s go,” said Draco.

Granger looked at him in surprise. “You’d come?”

Draco gave her his most nonchalant shrug. “I fancy a walk.”

Granger’s surprise turned to a prudent kind of delight. “All right, it’s about a fifteen minute ramble, that way. So the guidebook said, anyway.”

They clambered and slid down large boulders to the rocky beach, where they found a kind of coastal path. Granger led Draco along, pointing out features of geological or historical interest as they went. The views became progressively more dramatic as they left the shallow bay that the hotel was nestled in and made their way around the headland.

The tide began to come in. Draco rolled up his trousers and his shirtsleeves (ensuring, on the latter point, that his own glamour was in place), then tied his shoes together, and slung them over his shoulder. Granger carried her sandals hooked through her fingers. They splashed through salty rock pools, as warm as bathwater. The sound of the accordion on the wharf faded away; now it was only the heart-pulse of the waves.

They meandered into a flock of hundreds of seabirds, which took off around them and unravelled into the skies in a whirr of wingbeats and sea-cries. It was a startling moment of sublimity that took a bit of their souls with it. Granger watched the birds’ disappearance into the blue with a soft sigh, her fingertips on her collarbone, her lips parted.

Granger said, “Beautiful,” and Draco said, “Yes,” but they were not talking about the same thing.

They continued. The marker for the Magdalene’s point of arrival was a modest stone, half-buried in sand, at the tip of the headland. A few cut flowers were scattered about, as well as candles gamely fighting to stay lit in the breeze.

Granger furnished Draco with a great many details about the legend of the Magdalene’s expulsion from the Holy Land, and what disciples were with her, and when she had reached this shore. Draco cared little for the details, but he was glad of the excuse to keep his attention on her, on the way the wind wended her plait hither and thither, on her bare legs trickling with seawater. At one point, she almost lost her balance on the wet stones and her fingers touched his arm. They were quickly withdrawn.

Draco said he supposed that there were worse places to land than Provence. Granger said she thought so, too. Draco asked whether the Magdalene would’ve eaten marzipan-stuffed dates when she was here. Granger fancied that she was the one who had brought the recipe over from the Holy Land, in the first place. Draco said that stealing the credit for such a sublime culinary creation was a classically French thing to do. Granger agreed.

Then they lapsed into silence and they stood where the land met the sea, and breathed the sweet air, and were tickled by the salt breeze. Little waves strained to reach past their knees before atomising into brine.

Draco found a seastar. Hermione was delighted by the discovery and squatted down to look at it. She started to interrogate him on what species it was, but Draco said he hadn’t a sodding clue. Hermione was really only asking to be polite. She had already saved the image away in her mind and resolved to research it later. At this point, this was practically second nature. She had been surrounded by Ron and Harry for so many years that she had given up on other people having her desire for knowledge and understanding, but Draco had surprised her so far. She still didn't expect it of him but she couldn't deny that he had been a pleasure to talk to intellectually. He was by far the most experienced arithmancer and curse-breaker she had worked with at length, but he also thought through any problem quite logically and opinionatedly. Hermione was used to this in the Muggle world, but the closest thing she had to peers in the magical world were her grad students. None of the other professors in King's Hall were even close to her level of scientific understanding, and the fact that the magical world was entirely based on intuition and not math or logic made it hard to discuss disagreements and work towards solutions. Progress in the magical world was made almost purely by individuals. Hermione and her small group of researchers were quite unique. Hermione supposed that Draco's problem solving ability must come from dueling and his Auror work. This had never worked for Harry or Ron but Hermione had always thought that dueling and tactics worked the same part of the brain as solving a scientific question, and Draco seemed to be able to make that leap. His understanding of the Muggle world was almost as non-existant as Mr. Weasely's was misconstrued, but he was still able to offer up options and critique's or her plans.

They turned to walk back to the hotel, splish-splashing through the warm tide pools, wavelets clinging foamily at their ankles. Their hands brushed a time or two, and they said sorry, and stepped away from each other, and kept walking, and then their elbows brushed, by accident, because they’d drifted together again.

The large boulders near the wharf presented more difficulty for Granger on the way up than down; she stood, irresolute, grasping the wand in her pocket, but there were Muggles about, and her plans to Transfigure a stairway were interrupted.

Draco came up behind her and lifted her in one smooth motion, and received an indignant squeal and a face-full of sandy skirts for his troubles. Her waist felt narrow and taut between his palms, and warm.

He didn’t need her help to clamber up behind her, but he nevertheless accepted the small hand she reached towards him and took amusement in the serious effort she put into her pull.

They meandered back towards the hotel.

The sun poured gold across the horizon. With the brightness behind her, Granger looked like she was wearing nothing but light.
