#### [[The myth of black criminality began years before the war on drugs]]

White southerners used [[black codes]] to convince White northerners that black people were violent criminals, uncapable of living in modern society.
This involved films like #TO/DO/FIND (the one that reintroduced the Ku Klux Klan) and actually imprisoning and enslaving freed black people through
[[debt peonage]] and [[convict leasing]].

explained by:: [[Slavery became much cheaper after the Civil War]]
