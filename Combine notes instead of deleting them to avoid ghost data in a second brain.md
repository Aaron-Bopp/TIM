#### [[Combine notes instead of deleting them to avoid ghost data in a second brain]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`


[[Nodes in the second brain are made up of impermanent data and permanent metadata]] discusses how nodes metadata can last longer than their data. One way this happens is when you do not delete all links to a note before you delete a note. Instead of doing this, it is often possible to combine the note with another similar note, and let all the links be converted to that note. This can save a lot of [[friction]] when trying to delete your notes: [[The more mistakes you've fixed the more bad decisions you can afford#An experienced note taker know when to just delete a note]]
