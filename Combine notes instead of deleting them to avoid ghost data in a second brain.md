#### [[Combine notes instead of deleting them to avoid ghost data in a second brain]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Nodes in the second brain are made up of impermanent data and permanent metadata]] discusses how nodes metadata can last longer than their data. One way this happens is when you do not delete all links to a note before you delete a note. Instead of doing this, it is often possible to combine the note with another similar note, and let all the links be converted to that note. This can save a lot of [[friction]] when trying to delete your notes: [[The more mistakes you've fixed the more bad decisions you can afford#An experienced note taker know when to just delete a note]]

The main benefit to combining over deleting is that any links to that note should be replaced with a similar note, but this can result in a different kind of mistake, where you may change the meaning of a note when it changes to the new note. So it may be useful to look through backlinks and see where you need to completely remove the link, remove the link but leave the text, change the link to something else or let it be merged with a new note.
