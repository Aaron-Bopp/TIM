#### [[Why we'll never see anything like The Lord of the Rings trilogy again ]]

**Summary**:: [[The Lord of the Rings]] movies will never be matched again in budget, production, or artistry again. From the budget and shooting schedule which are still not relatively matched to this day, to the insane 26 weeks of pre-production that the movies went through, to the multiple pieces of [[technology]] that we pioneered or invented for these films, these movies captured [[energy]] and people that will likely never be caught again.
