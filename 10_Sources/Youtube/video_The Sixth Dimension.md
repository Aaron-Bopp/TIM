**Summary**:: Adding two more dimensions to our understanding of [[physics]] allows us to solve for a [[cosmological constant]] that isn't zero. We can model these [[dimensions]] as an egg that sits at every point on [[spacetime]]. The only one of the major forces that reaches these dimensions is [[gravity]] which could explain the extremely small positive cosmological constant that we need to solve [[general relativity]].
