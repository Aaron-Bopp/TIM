##### [[video_The I don't dream of labour trend needs to be destroyed]]

**Creator**:: [[Kidology]]
 
**Source**:: [The "I don't dream of labour" trend needs to be destroyed . - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpkiXoG4azE)

**Summary**:: "I don't dream of labor" is a term often thrown around in [[leftist]] spaces, but the people who are saying are not embodying leftist, and specifically [[anti-capitalist]] ideas. While they are not focused solely on the accumulation of capital, they are using the [[neo-liberal]] capitalist system in order to allow themselves to not work. While many do this do have anti-capitalist attitudes, the actions they are taking primarily benefit themselves and don't promote [[class solidarity]]

**Covers**:: [[capitalism]], [[Marxism]], [[communism]], [[neoliberalism]], [[liberalism]], [[labor]], [[passive income]], [[internet]]
