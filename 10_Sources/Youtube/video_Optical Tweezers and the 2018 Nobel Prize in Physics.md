**Summary**:: Video details [[optical tweezers]] and how they can be used to measure extremely small things such as [[DNA]]. These work by refracting light through a small thing that can refract light in such a way that it stays in one spot. They can then measure the light coming out to determine if there was any movement. These are sensitive enough to detect [[gravity]] on a really tiny scale. It also covers a way of making optical pulses of light by splitting light into different wavelengths, slowing down certain frequencies and then recombining in such a way that it creates and incredibly short pulse.
