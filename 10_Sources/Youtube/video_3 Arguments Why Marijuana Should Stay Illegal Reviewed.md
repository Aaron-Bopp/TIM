**Summary**:: 1. [[Cannabis]] is a strong drug. Just like how [[hard liquor]] became much more popular during [[prohibition]], the amount of [[THC]] has increased in marijuana over recent years, while the amount of [[CBD]] has decreased. This could lead to an increase in [[Psychosis]], although this has not been shown. 2. Gateway drug. Not only are there bigger gateway drugs (cigarettes). Prohibition has not been shown to increase addiction + [[Portugal]] example. [[Marijuana]] is addictive for about 10% of users. This is an increasing problem correlated with increase in [[THC]]. 3. Marijuana is harmful. We still don't fully understand the harmful effects of Marijuana, but they are likely no more worse than alcohol or cigarettes. If we legalize we can explore these more easily. Overall, the conclusion is to legalize and regulate.
