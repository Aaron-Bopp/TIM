#### [[video_Aesop didn't know about Meta-Irony]]
**Creator**:: [[TimmyM]]
 
**Source**:: [Aesop didn't know about Meta-Irony. - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yso4rK3x5ow)

**Summary**:: This video discusses the negative affects of meta-[[irony]], and how it has contributed to a loss of [[self]] among young people. This type of irony is vital to the [[internet]], as it's ability to mask it's true meaning allows for people to hear what they want to hear.
