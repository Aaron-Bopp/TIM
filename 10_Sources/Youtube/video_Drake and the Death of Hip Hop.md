#### [[video_Drake and the Death of Hip Hop]]

**Creator**:: [[F.D Signifier]]
 
**Source**:: [Drake and the Death of Hip Hop - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtBPXjEoW54) 

**Summary**:: More than just criticizing Drake's music or persona, this video explores the way in with the rise of the [[internet]] has impacted [[Hip Hop]] both for the better and for the worse. The increased mobility of the internet has allowed for up and coming artists to have more control and less involvement with corporate [[media]], it has also meant that the "gatekeepers" of Hip Hop have not been able to keep it as black centered as they could before. When viewing Hip Hop as a way of black art this is pollution. 

**Covers**:: [[art]], [[BIPOC]], [[Black Americans]], [[music]]
