### [Healing from Festered Emotions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXGhT4pJcj8)

- There is the emotional mind, the intellectual mind and the [[subconscious]]
    - if you don't know who you are where does your sense of [[self]] come from --> others
    - one function of [[subconscious]] is to compare
    - #Ref/DrK "[[subconscious]] is when the sense of [[self]] comes from the outside"
- #TO/PONDER/ME  Is my vacuum of [[self]] filled with my intelligence?
-  [[Alexithymia]] - someone who is colorblind to emotion
    - Men are socially developed to suppress emotions except for anger
        - anger is the only thing men understand
        - all other emotions are not developed
- #Ref/DrK "There is evidence that having an internally consistent way of viewing the world is a good way to find peace and [[happiness]] and to build resilience"
    - What is the way I am viewing my life and existence?
- Ways to find **_[[There aren't any downsides to working through trauma]]_**
    - Experiential route
        - ex find masculinity/what it means to be a man inside yourself
    - philosophical route
    - Dreams and nightmares
[[Dual Nostril Breathing Meditation]]
- Everytime you bring your mind back from wandering its a mental pushup
    - [[ADHD]] is your mind ==wandering without any [[purpose]]== ([[ADHD is primarily an executive function disorder]])
- #Ref/DrK "We are going to pyschologically traumatize our kids no matter how much we [[love]] them" [YT](https://youtu.be/sXGhT4pJcj8?t=2602)
