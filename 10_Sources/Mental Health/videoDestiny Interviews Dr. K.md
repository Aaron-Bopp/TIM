    - [[Reincarnation]] is just one aspect of this.
    - Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.
    - Some of things in this life come from before the consciously observable life of an individual
- Dharma is the moral opposite of [[karma|Kharma]]
- #TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH  Evidence based alternative medicine
- #Ref/DrK Between your emotional and logical mind is the hum ghar or [[subconscious]] which activates to protect you from negative emotions and bullies your intellectual mind into coming up with justifications
- #TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH  MDMA and Pcysolibin might be a telescope to new topics
