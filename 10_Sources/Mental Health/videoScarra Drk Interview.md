- #TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH cognitive [[empathy]]
-  [18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB8g3n10_Z8#t=1085.282509721527)
	- [[happiness]] there is a difference between contentment and momentary happiness
### working on [[empathy]] and chasing [[happiness]]
- Empathy vs solutions
- always chase happy vs 
- loving to win vs hating to lose
- fix things vs listening
### logic vs empathy
- Scarra had frustration with people not being able to just do it
- cognitive [[empathy]]
- "when you say that the rationalization is the best way it's because that's what you're the best at"
### low self-worth
- Admits that he has very low [[self-worth]], but then immediately goes and says that's normal, when [[Dr. K]] pushes he admits that he is being more vulnerable than he likes 
- "Logic is your shield and you constantly work on yourself but that feeling of worthlessness doesn't go away"
- "the more you work and that feeling doesn't go away what do you conclude"
- scarra feels like he is incapable of certain and things but deals with that by saying that he can never be perfect, [[Dr. K]] pushes back by saying you can never be perfect but saying that in response to your own feelings engenders [[hopelessness]] i.e Your someone that could do something but won't 
### how does [[Dr. K]] approach 
- Recognizes verbally that something will be difficult
- mirrors why patient rationalizes but pushes back against the [[purpose]] of that [[rationalizations|rationalization]]
- asks basic questions like "What did you say in response this question" and lets the patient work through it 
- stops [[rationalizations]] before they fully start and calls out that they are being too logical 
	- circles back later because he cut them off 
- after a moment vulnerability pushes for self reflection "When you look in the mirror what do you see"
	- this question is asked multiple times throughout and prompts a more in-depth answer each time
- doesn't immediately call out things he notices like microexpressions but brings them up later after he has prepared them to accept it
- doesn't ask some questions because they will bring up emotions, "Some questions don't need to be asked"
