#### Terms
- [[Karma Fal]]
- [[Bhagavad Gita]]
## Notes
- [[Bhagavad Gita]] some consider it to be the bible of [[Hinduism]] but it is a central text
	- [[Krishna]] talking to [[Arjuna]] on the brink of great battle
		- [[Krishna]] is believed to be an incarnation of [[God]]
### [[You can't control what happens you can only control what you do]]
- [[Karma Fal]] - [[karma]] = action + Fal = fruit
	- You don't deserve any fruit from your actions you only deserve the action itself
		- this isn't a natural way of thinking but being outcome oriented leads to a lot of [[suffering]]
	- You need to commit your self to action
		- if you commit yourself to the outcome then you are invested in your failure/success 
			- [[Buddhism is the study of happiness through detachment]]
		- devoting yourself to action leads to [[success]] brings peace
			- [[The most reliable path to success is repeatedly trying to succeed]]
	- ex: getting in shape is not an action you can take
	- ex: you can't save a life but you can try
