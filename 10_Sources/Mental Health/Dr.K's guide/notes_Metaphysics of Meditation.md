#### Terms
- [[Brahman]]

## Notes
- [[Yogi]]s believed that everything came from a sea of formless [[conscious|consciousness]] called [[Brahman]]
	- [[Consciousness is the fundamental unit of existence]]
	- when [[Brahman]] coalesces to become [[energy]] and energy coalesces to become [[matter]]
	- [[Karma is based in the law of cause and effect]] through the conservation of matter
- This belief was opposed to other [[belief systems]] that relied on higher powers ([[hierarchy]]). Instead of an all powerful god it was simple cause and effect
	- [[Yoga|Yogic]] tradition is a scientific tradition
- [[mantra]] oscillations in [[Brahman]] creates a particular thing
	- this loosely relates to [[String Theory]]
- [[quantum mechanics]]
	- If you can describe a quality [[Brahman]] is not that, it is never a manifestation it is the potentiality
