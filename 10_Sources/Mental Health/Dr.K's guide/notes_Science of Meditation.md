## Notes
#### [[Meditation regulates your hormones and stress physiology]]
- Studies have found [[meditation|meditating]] for at least 20 minutes every day or every other it will affect you
	- This is because of [[Stress]] physiology
		- [[Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal (HPA) Axis]]
			- stress starts in [[hypothalamus]] which travels to [[Pituitary Gland]]
			- [[Pituitary Gland]] produces [[Cortisol]] 
			- [[Cortisol]] affects [[adrenal]] glands
		- 20 minutes is what is needed to turn off [[Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal (HPA) Axis]]
	- A [[hormone]] is a body wide affect
		- [[Cortisol]] gets your entire body ready for a stressful environment  ^574aea
			- [[Our brains are built around survival]] [[Cortisol]] is what helps us keep us alive
		- [[Cortisol]] will make [[ADHD]] worse [[ADHD is not a lack of attention it is a misplacement of attention]]
		- [[Cortisol]] also affects our [[immune system]] (it wants to get ready to heal)
		- high stress worsen auto-immune diseases
	- [[Eustress]] is the perfect amount of [[stress]] to bring out our best stress
		- [[flow state]] is the state of optimal activity (good [[hormone|hormonal]] balance)
#### [[Meditation helps us regulate our nervous system]]
- [[ANS]]
	- Yin and yang is an ancient study of the body
		- there are times when our body is prepped and ready to go and times when our body is relaxed
	- [[Sympathetic Nervous System]]
		- mode of activity where you are prepped for [[fight-or-flight response]]
		- increases [[heart rate]], [[blood pressure]]
	- [[Parasympathetic Nervous System]]
		- Blood goes away from limbs to our stomach
		- decreases [[blood flow]] to certain parts of our brain
		- causes food coma
	- [[meditation]] can regulate the [[ANS]] be activating the [[Sympathetic Nervous System]] or [[Parasympathetic Nervous System]]
		- [[Dual Nostril Breathing Meditation]] either nostril will affect either the [[Sympathetic Nervous System]] or [[Parasympathetic Nervous System]]
#### [[Meditation helps us gain control over our emotions]]
- Maturity is governed by the [[Frontal Lobe]] 
	- Part of your brain responsible for [[maturity]], [[impulse]] control, & [[executive function]]
- [[Limbic System]] is where [[emotions]] come from
	- sometimes there is a war between your [[Frontal Lobe]] and [[Limbic System]] or your emotions or logic
- As you meditate, your [[Frontal Lobe|Frontal Lobes]] gain control over your [[Limbic System]] to help you control and regulate your [[emotions]]
- [[Meditation helps us develop empathy]]
	- there is cursory evidence for this
#### [[Meditation helps us detach negative attachments]]
- [[Association Cortices]] attach meaning to certain events
	- as we meditate we separate out from our [[Association Cortices]]
