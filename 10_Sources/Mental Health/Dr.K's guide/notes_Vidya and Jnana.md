	- [[knowledge]] has two types [[Vidya]] and [[Jnana]]
	- [[Vidya]] == information, objective, transmissible
		- facts
	- [[Jnana]] == understanding, subjective, non-transmissible
		- [[realization]], [[conversion]], understanding, experience
	- common answers for how to change your life include [[motivation]], [[discipline]], laziness
	- People who are successful don't describe their [[motivation]] they describe their [[realization]]
	- [[Yogi]]s believe closest you can come to [[truth]] is through [[Jnana]]

			- [[Jnana]] removes this concept
