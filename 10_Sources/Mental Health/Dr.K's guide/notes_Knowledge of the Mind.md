#### Notes
- [[Ayurveda]] helps us [[structure]] our day
- Our [[unconscious]] is our [[Citta]]
- When trying to study
	- if you're lucky everything will sink into the [[unconscious]], but usually you have to read it multiple times
- [[Yogi]]s believe all [[knowledge]] comes from within
	- When we study the lightbulb going off is us discovering that knowledge in our [[mind]] 
		- is this just connection of neurons? [[Nodes in the second brain are an abstraction of our first brain]]
	- [[How to read to understand]]
		-  we need to read and study at a time when our [[conscious]] is calm
	- [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]]
	- [[What is the difference between creation and recreation]]
	- [[We learn by transforming information into understanding]]
- the more active our [[mind]] the less we will be able to absorb
- why we should study in the [[Brahmamuhurtha]]
	- [[Dr. K]] started studying in the [[Brahmamuhurtha]] when his mind was less active
		- this allowed him to absorb better in class and not have to force himself to study after class
		- One think to note is that [[Dr. K]] is very good at self study and has strong [[Vata]] this may not work for everyone 
	- Waking up early
	- visual acuity is higher (we see more shades of green) at dawn and dusk, we have evolved to be more active and dawn and dusk [[Humans are a product of evolution]]
	- [[Brahmamuhurtha]] will probably not work for teenagers as they're [[circadian rhythm]] is shifted forward a couple hours
	- we can also adjust what we are [[senses|sensing]] ([[Indriya]]), by lighting certain incense listening to music 
- this is why [[spaced repetition]] is valuable. working memory gets locked down into our permanent memory in the [[Hippocampus]] while we [[sleep]] 
- if we create boundaries around or time our [[mind]] will start to respect those
	- [[Meditation is a practice to gain control over your thoughts]]
	- contrasts [[Better tools allow us to be less disciplined and more productive]] because this [[discipline]] actually makes our [[mind]] a better tool 
- How to study depending on your [[Dosha]]
	- [[Kapha]] slower to start but once they get into they can go for a very long time
	- [[Pitta]] can study for long period but needs break at the end of the day
	- [[Vata]] brief periods with breaks
- [[knowledge]] is called from our [[unconscious]] to our [[conscious]] [[mind]]
