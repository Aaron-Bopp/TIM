## Notes
prev:: [[notes_Karma Fal]]
- How to live in the present instead of looking towards the future
- We base our value on success and outcomes because of [[society]] ex: new years resolutions
- Our brain is incredibly good at reinforcing actions
	- We set really abstract goals like stay sober for a year, but our mind pushes us to instant gratification
	- Success comes from focusing on actions not outcomes
		- [[You can't control what happens you can only control what you do]]
- Break down problems into very small things
	- imagine you are writing a program for a computer to follow
