## Notes
Our mind tends to deal with anxiety in four ways:  

1.  Distraction 
	- allows us to temporarily avoid [[anxiety]] it temporarily reduces our [[suffering]]
	- distraction isn't necessarily bad, but there are more healthy ways to bring our [[mind]] to the present
2.  Control uncertainty via avoidance
	- we lose control of our life to [[anxiety]]
3.  Remove uncertainty via reassurance
	- leads to us to be dependent on other people
	- reassurance does not necessarily lead to [[confidence]]
		- if reassurance leads us to take the risk, then that can lead to [[confidence]]
			- [[Confidence comes when you are more capable of handling diverse outcomes]] 
4.  Fighting the anxiety
	- we can push through our [[anxiety]], but we are still going to deal with that anxiety in the future and it will exhaust us
[[Anxiety prevents us from living in the present]]
