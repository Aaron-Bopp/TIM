For context see 
prev:: [[notes_What is achievement]]

## How to reorientate your attitude for achievement

- How to live in the present instead of looking towards the future
- We base our value on success and outcomes because of [[society]] ex: new years resolutions
- Our brain is incredibly good at reinforcing actions
	- We set really abstract goals like stay sober for a year, but our mind pushes us to instant gratification
	- Success comes from focusing on actions not outcomes
		- [[You can't control what happens]]
- Break down problems into very small things
	- imagine you are writing a program for a computer to follow

## Surround yourself with a [[community]] that will motivate you

- building the right kind of [[community]] will shape your thinking in the correct way
- you can take an action without having a thought before hand
	- [[Right kinds of thoughts lead to right kinds of actions]]
- thoughts come from outside [[Indriya]]/[[senses]]
	- or thoughts come from within
	- [[Indriya]] creates [[Samskara]]/memories
- What effect does community have?
	- What are the affects on your actions when you interact with a certain group
		- ex: PArents tell you how much potential you have
			- you could do it if you just tried
			- kid feels stupid and shameful because they feel like it should be easy
		- ex: gamers who keep eachother in mediocrity
	- A community may feel good but have bad results on your life or a group can feel bad but have good effects on your life
- [[How to develop a meditation practice]]
	- a good [[meditation]] practice requires a good [[Sangha]]
		- Prompts you to practice
		- teach you principles of [[meditation]]
		- help you through struggles

## Cleanliness

- [[Shuddhi]] or cleansing for when you are feeling brain fog
	- [[mind-body complex]] can't run optimally unless [[body]] and [[mind]] are clean and pure
	- step in [[Raja Yoga]]
- Why do we feel better after we shower?
	- correlation between messiness of room and [[depression]]
		- [[feedback loop]] of a little bit of cleaning leads to a little bit of [[happiness]] which leads to more cleaning
			- [[Insecure material conditions increase cognitive load and reduce outcomes]]
			- opposite [[Hierarchy of needs]]
- top-down thinking
	- order from [[cerebral cortex]] to get [[body]] in line
- [[bottom-up stimulus]]
	- [[Indriya]] distract us
	- this is why we can't study in a loud environment
- sleep clears out [[Adenosine]] which is a waste product
	- herbs can help our brain clear these out
	- [[Ashwagandha]] is [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] herd that helps with [[Dementia]], [[Parkinson's Disease]], [[Alzheimer's Disease]], [[Mad cow disease]]
- [[Psychotherapy]]
	- [[trauma]] is emotional junk that creates [[bottom-up stimulus]] that our brain has to avoid if it want to get anything done
		- [[Our ego is our subconscious defense of our self]]
	- patients feel clean after this process of emotional catharsis
- current [[Neuroscience]] research points to same things
- this is why going for walks, candles, cleaning your room, brushing your teeth all have such big impacts

## Personal [[philosophy]] for achievement

- [[Yama]] are [[society|societal]] observances
- [[Niyama]]s are personal observance
	- [[meditation]] is a spiritual regimen
		- helps with mental health
- [[Yoga is a wholistic philosophy of self-improvement]]
- [[Satya]]
	- Practice: go as long as you can without telling a lie
		- this focuses us on the present moment because it is cognitively expensive to aware of your thoughts and words
	- If you commit to this it will change your actions
	- helps you detach
		- open yourself up to the consequences of your actions
		- when you let go of lying to let go of the consequences of your actions
- [[Neuroscience]] of [[meditation]]
	- increasing awareness of current moment
- Yoga isn't about faith it's about experimentation
- [[Niyama]]s aren't about morality, they are about action
