#### Terms
- [[Pratyahara]]
- [[Indriya]]

#### Notes
- If we can learn how to populate our mind with helpful thought that will lead to helpful actions
- Thoughts from the outside come from the [[Indriya]]s
- [[Pratyahara]] is the way to gain control of your sense organs, create a window (with movable curtains) between you and the world
- Thoughts can also come from the inside through [[Samskara]]s, these are emotions or learnings that have sunk into our [[subconscious]] [[mind]]
