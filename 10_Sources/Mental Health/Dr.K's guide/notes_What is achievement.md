#### Terms
- [[Karma Fal]]
- [[Bhagavad Gita]]
## The core problem is a misunderstanding of motivation
- We aren't taught what motivation is or where it comes from
	- [[desire]] and [[motivation]] are very different things
		- Despite desire people don't act in their own self interest
		- motivation helps you overcome your habits
			- habit is automatic thought, and motivation is intentional thought
	- [[Yogi|Yogis]] realized motivation is just keeping one thought in mind over a long period of time
		- other people will perceive this as motivation
		- [[Meditation is a practice to gain control over your thoughts]]
		- [[Meditation increases our ability to influence the world]]
		- [[The most reliable path to success is repeatedly trying to succeed]]
- [[Dharana]] is training to keep your mind focused on one point
	- our [[mind]] doesn't know how to focus
		- our mind is a lightbulb but we need to make it a laser beam
	- Our actions are cultivated out of our thoughts
	- The most [[success|successful]] people keep their mind focused on one thought
## [[Karma Fal]] is a mindset to reframe the process of achievement
- Side note on [[history]]
	- [[Bhagavad Gita]] some consider it to be the bible of [[Hinduism]] but it is a central text
		- [[Krishna]] talking to [[Arjuna]] on the brink of great battle
			- [[Krishna]] is believed to be an incarnation of [[God]]
### [[You can't control what happens]]
- [[Karma Fal]] - [[karma]] = action + Fal = fruit
	- You don't deserve any fruit from your actions you only deserve the action itself
		- this isn't a natural way of thinking but being outcome oriented leads to a lot of [[suffering]]
	- You need to commit your self to action
		- if you commit yourself to the outcome then you are invested in your failure/success 
			- [[Buddhism is the study of happiness through detachment]]
		- devoting yourself to action leads to [[success]] brings peace
			- [[The most reliable path to success is repeatedly trying to succeed]]
	- ex: getting in shape is not an action you can take
	- ex: you can't save a life but you can try
