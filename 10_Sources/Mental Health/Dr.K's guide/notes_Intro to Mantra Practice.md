#### Terms
- [[Dharana]]
- [[Dhyana]]
- [[Samadhi]]
- [[mantra]]

## Notes
- [[mantra]] can be in your [[language]] and have personal meaning but should have specific sounds that give them power
- [[mantra]] isn't about the power of positive thinking (implanting positive thoughts into the mind) because it isn't putting thoughts into your mind, it's about taking things out of your [[mind]]
- a [[mantra]] should be given to you by a guru
	- How to find a guru? rely on your [[karma]] and a guru will prevent themselves
### [[Meditation is a practice to gain control over your thoughts]]
- This what our active mind looks like: I. the outer senses ([[Indriya]]), II. [[conscious]] mind, and III. [[unconscious]] ([[Citta]])
	- ![[Pasted image 20211231162517.png]]

	- First stage is to clear out the [[mind]]

	- There is a relationship between implanting stuff in the [[subconscious]] and the calmness of the [[conscious]] i.e. if your brain is full of thoughts when studying nothing will stick in your longterm memory

	- A [[mantra]] gets implanted in the [[unconscious]], and then can be used to calm the [[conscious]] (sort of like a positive [[Samskara]]?)

### [[Meditation is a practice to develop a stronger conscious]]
- You first use [[mantra]] as a [[Dharana]], then as you reach [[Dhyana]] it will implant itself in the [[subconscious]], where it's power grows and can help you achieve [[Samadhi]]. 
- There is scientific evidence for [[mantra]] as [[Dharana]] and [[Dhyana]] but not as [[Samadhi]] as that is a much more [[spirituality|spiritual]] concept
- Once you reach [[Samadhi]], your [[mantra]] becomes a way to affect reality.
- [[mantra]] helps you channel the [[Brahman]] like really really advanced [[manifestation]]
	- [[Belief pulls you forward into life]]
- [[Japa Meditation]]
