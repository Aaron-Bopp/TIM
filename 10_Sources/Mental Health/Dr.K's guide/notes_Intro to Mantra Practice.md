#### Terms
- [[Dharana]]
- [[Dhyana]]
- [[Samadhi]]
- [[Mantra]]

#### Notes
- [[Mantra]] can be in your [[language]] but don't have to be
- [[Mantra]] isn't about the power of positive thinking (implanting positive thoughts into the mind) because it isn't putting thoughts into your mind, it's about taking things out of your [[mind]]
- This what our active mind looks like: I. the outer senses ([[Indriya]]), II. thoughts, and III. thought generators ([[Samskara]]])
