## Notes
- [[Default Mode Network (DMN)]] Gives us the capacity of [[self-awareness]]
	- Humans are separated by our ability to observe our thought
- In [[depression]] [[Default Mode Network (DMN)]] becomes hyperactive
	- you get stuck thinking about yourself
- [[mind]] pushes away external stimuli
- if we can turn off the [[Default Mode Network (DMN)]] we can get rid of [[depression]]
	- [[Ketamine]] causes us to [[dissociation]] from ourselves
	- [[Ketamine]] shuts of our [[Default Mode Network (DMN)]] within hours
		- when the [[Ketamine]] wears off it gets turned off again
	- [[meditation]] also shuts down the [[Default Mode Network (DMN)]]
- [[Vairagya]] is [[detachment]] and similar to shutting off the [[Default Mode Network (DMN)]]
	- people can again happiness this way because they can take a step back and realize the scale of their problems
		- [[Buddhism is the study of happiness through detachment]]
