## Notes
prev:: [[notes_Metaphysics of Meditation]]
- [[Suffering]] comes from not being able to understand yourself - [[Yogi]]
- Am I my body? no, my body changes but I am still me
- Am I my [[mind]]? no, there is a you-ness that transcends emotion
- Am I my [[identity]]? no, identity can change
- These are what we are taught we are, but they are untrue. In the absense of understanding yourself we develop the [[ego]]
- [[ego]] is what you identify with
- connection to your identity leads to [[suffering]]
	- you get attached to your identity and when that is challenged it hurts us more
- [[Consciousness is our capacity to introspect]]
	- Our capacity to witness is constant throughout our the lives
	- Ground yourself in the observer
