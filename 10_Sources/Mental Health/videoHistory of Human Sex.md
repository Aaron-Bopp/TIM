## [History of Human Sex](https://www.livescience.com/7088-history-human-sex.html)
- Cave paintings show that sex was on the mind of young humans 10k-35k years ago
- It is impossible to tell whether humans enjoyed sex less or more in the past
- Cultural restraints have had the biggest impact
	- The idea that sex is taboo goes farther back than the story of Eve
	- 1800s was a watershed moment for sexuality in the west
	- Birth control massively accelerated sex drives for [[women]] in the 1960s to current day
	- > An informal 2005 global sex survey sponsored by the [condom](https://www.livescience.com/3805-spain-catholic-church-backs-condoms.html) company Durex confirmed Buss' views. Just 3 percent of [[America|Americans]] polled called their sex lives "monotonous," compared to a sizable 26 percent of Indian respondents. While 53 percent of Norwegians wanted more sex than they were having (a respectable 98 times per year, on average), 81 percent of the Portuguese were quite happy with their national quota of 108 times per year.
