#### Notes
- Heritability
- Adaptation
- [[hormones]] and [[Neurotransmitter]]s are like a lock and a key
- [[proteins]] are the workhorses of what have cells.
	- made up of Amino acids
		- amino acids relationships with water determines how they fit together and the shape of the protein
	- [[DNA]] coding for a sequence of amino acids create a protein
	- Everything about [[protein function is about shape]]
		- also about when their shape can change
- [[enzymes]] are [[catalyst|catalysts]] 
	- enzymes fit things together pull them apart,
		- make this happen faster
	- enzymes are usually proteins
- [[Retro viruses]] are when [[RNA]] get's turned back into [[DNA]] by an enzyme
	- This discovery was significant because it disrupted the flow of information that was accepted pre-1970s, i.e DNA is always the source of truth
