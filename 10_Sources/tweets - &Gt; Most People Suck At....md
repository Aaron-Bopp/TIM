see this is a nice opportunity to shill my book but 
1. I'm still working on it and 
2. I still don't feel 95% confident + assured in my conscience in saying "this will help you". I'm at like 65% confidence. I expect to get to ~80% as I finish it, then the responses will tell

I hope to be Seen for this class of restraint, because it's very easy to just be brazenly overconfident about everything and then sell to the most clueless people with overblown bravado
but I'm still not sure about the book, that's the truth and I try to be honest
