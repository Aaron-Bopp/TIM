your mind springs up all kinds of random shit all the time - just take a look at the last dream you had.
you are not your mind. you cannot choose or control your thoughts, what you do choose is how you respond to them. (if you need an example, google the white bear problem)

tw - specific thoughts of violence + suicide
whenever i am waiting for a train, my brain tells me to jump in front of it.
this doesn't mean i want to jump in front of a train.
thoughts are just thoughts. they are not wants or emotions, they are literally just thoughts.
