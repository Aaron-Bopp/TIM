I'm saying, for me, the reason i got off of that island in the way that i was experiencing it, is because, in order to m an the foundational truths of christianity i was, i it became impossible for me to maintain those truths and some other truths that i felt like have become inescapable. And so i find myself in this bridge between those two things. But when o finding is that's a really interesting place to live. And there's a lot of people who've been living there for a very long time, throughout history. I'm talking about a couple of contemporary people. One of the things that maria talks about, she's so well read, i and, you know, in her book, figuring, which i just started reading, which is like, you know, i go in terms of how long the audible book is versus how many pages there are, but it's 21 hours. So this is where you buckle up, buttercup, you know, san s what a lot of figuring a.
