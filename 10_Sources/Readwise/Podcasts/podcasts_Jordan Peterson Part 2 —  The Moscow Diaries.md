The Holocaust denial pipeline and Nazi propaganda
Summary:
The economic wonder of not germany is a knotsy propaganda myth. Hitler's many aggressive foreign policy actions and his accelerating persecution of the jews during the second half of the 19 thirties were partly intended as distractions from the poor economy. M peterson uses a false narrative of concern with health and cleanliness to argue that hitler, in 19 33, initiated mass tuberculosis screenings which actually turned out to be a good thing. Screenings were not a good thing, but were used to identify people deemed unworthy of life.
Transcript:
Speaker 1
he does this thing where he's like, you know, obviously hitler was a monster. Obviously atrocities, but you know, you have to give him credit for saving the german economy in the 19 thirties. You know, you might not like his policies, but, you know, there were some good things about the regime as well. Thiss. This is what harret says, the economic wonder of not germany is a knotsy propaganda myth. Economic problems were rife already by late 19 34, this is a year after hitler came to power, and only got worse from there. Hitler's many aggressive foreign policy actions and his accelerating persecution of the jews during the second half of the 19 thirties were partly intended as distractions from the poor economy. It's not true that, like, you have to give, you have to give it to hitler on this one. Like, you really don't actually

Speaker 1
anything. He also does this fake, like, hard truth's thing, like, you got to admit about the notses being elected. Like, you know, hitler was elected. And, like, no, in the last free and fair election that they had in germany, he got 37 % of the vote, totally. This is another one. M peterson uses a false narrative of concern with health and cleanliness to argue that hitler, in 19 33, initiated mass tuberculosis screenings, which actually turned out to be a good thing. So, again, we're in the lie. One got to admit hillher did some good stuff, it says, but no such massive screenings for the benefit of public health occurred. The notes considered tuberculosis a sign of racial inferiority, and often referred to jews as racial t b infecting the body. Politics. Holy mother fucking shane. Screenings were not a good thing, but were used to identify people deemed unworthy of life. Tuberculosis was effectively used as a biological weapon in the ghettos and concentration camps during the war. Holy fuck. Again. It's like he's never really leaned in to, like, where this stuff goes. But these are the kinds of arguments that get people curious about this stuff, right? And get people in this frame of like, well, maybe the main stream media isn't telling the full story about the noses, right?
