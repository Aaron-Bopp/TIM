Theoreticians Are Just People Who Runt Experiments in Their Head
Summary:
"My curiosity is bigger than my ego. That's sometin i have to think about, cause you always struggle about the role of ego in life," he says. "If the curiosity one is bigger, then a ego will do just fine and make you a fund to talk to." 'As long as that happens, i can, i canom,' he adds.
Transcript:
Speaker 1
So my cure is so i have, you know, like everybody, ego problems. But my curiosity is bigger than my ego. So as long as that happens, i can, i canom.
Speaker 2
That is so powerful. You just dropping so powerful. I so curiosity is than ego. That's sometin i have to think about, cause you always struggle about the role of ego in life. And ah, thats that's so nice to think about. Don't think about the size of ego, the absolute size of ego. Think about the relative size of ego to the other, the other horses pulling at you. If the curiosity one is bigger, then a ego will do just fine and make you a fund to talk to.

Asteroid Belt
Summary:
On earth, at the formation of earth, interaction of chemicals and molecules in vironment gave selection. You could think about in chemistry, we coun have an infinite number of reactions happen but they don't o all the reactions allowed to happen don't happen. So there must be some things called catalists out there, or there are bits of minerals that lowers the energy barrier for the reaction,. And so you get one reaction over another, a series of possibilities occurring that makes a particular molecule. Before you know it, almost these waves as discreet reactions work together, and you start to build a machinery that that tt is run by existence. There's no such thing as 'productive selection

universe. But if you look in the asteroid belt, selection, if er objects are being ked in and out the asteroid belt. Er those trajectories are quite complex. You don't really look at that as productive selection, because itis not doing anything to improve its function. But is it theas asteroid belt has existed for some time, so there is some selection going on, but the functionality is somewhat limited. On earth, er, at the formation of earth, interaction of chemicals and molecules in vironment gave selection, and then things could happen becase. You could think about in chemistry, we coun have an infinite number of reactions happen, but they don't o all the reactions allowed to happen don't happen. Why? Because they're energy barriers. So there must be some things called catalists out there, or there are bits of minerals that, when two molecules get together on that mineral, it lowers the energy barrier for the reaction, and so the reaction is promote. So so you get one reaction over another, a series of possibilities occurring that makes a particular molecule. And this keeps happening in steps, and before you know it, almost these waves as discreet reactions work together, and you start to build a machinery that that tt is run by existence. So as you you go forward in time, the fact that a molecule s the bonds are getting there are more bonds in a

What is a von norman kind of constructor?
Summary:
i think von normann constructors, hew wanted to conceive of a minimal thing, autonomar, that could build itself. And what would those rules look like in the world? i'm really fascinated by that, although it's probably not exactly what happened er, it's a nice model. Because, you're just part of the universe,. a creating its memory, designing exactly, rewriting history, rewriting exactly imperfectly. I don't know why anywhere if he didn't come up with it, he probably came up with itdan rado, there was a couple of people did at the same time, and then conway, orversy took it on. And then wolfram

And
Speaker 2
i think, why anywhere if he didn't come up with it,
Speaker 1
he probably did come up with itdan rado, there was a couple of people did at the same time, and then conway, orversy took it on. And then wolfram loves c a. There is his fabric of the universe. And what i think he imagined was that he wasn't satisfied. And this may be incorrect on but so a lot of what i say is going to be kind of, you know, just
Speaker 2
way out of my yerly. You're just part of the universe, a
Speaker 1
creating its memory, designing exactly, rewriting history, rewriting exactly imperfectly. So, but what i mean is, i think he wouldhe like this idea of thinking about er, how could a chewing machine literally build itself without chering chine? It's like, literally, how did state machines emerge? And i think that von normann constructors, hew wanted to conceive of a minimal thing, autonomar, that could build itself. And what would those rules look like in the world? And that's what a von norman kind of constructor looked like, lik it's a minimal hypothetical object that could build itself, self, replicate and er. And i'm really fascinated by that, because i think that er, although it's probably not exactly what happened er, it's a nice model.

Replication As E Overnight, When You Have Bonds
Summary:
I think replication, replicating molecules are rare. On 20 ther dose as trawethers, there's about more than 18 mills of water in there. So much of the possibilities i universe are just broken back into atoms. I had one of the reasons i started doing inorganic chemistry and making rust based on a thing called malibdinum.

Speaker 2
I
Speaker 1
think it's really, really easy. Walkehead, did not expect that. I think it's really, really easy. Well, let's take a step back. I think replication, replicating molecules are rare. But if you say, you know, i was saying on i've probably got into trouble. On 20 ther dose as trawethers, there's about more than 18 mills of water in there. So one mole of water, six point zero two, two times ten to 23 molecules. That's about the number of stars in the universe, i think, of the order. So there's three universes worth, but betwee one. And somebody corrected youanty as ive. I'm always being corrected. It's ha, great ut. But there's a lot of molecules in the water here, and so and so there's a lot of so although it's, for you and me, really hard to conceive of if existence is not the default for a long period of time, because what happens as the molecules get degraded? So so much of the possibilities i universe are just broken back into atoms. So you have this er, this kind of er destruction of the molecules, b chemical reactions. So you only need one or two molecules to become good at copy themselves for them suddenly to then take resources in the pool and start to grow. And so them. Replication as e overtime, when you have bonds, i think, is much simpler and much easier. And i even found this in my lab u years ago. I had one of the reasons i started doing inorganic chemistry and making rust, making a bit of rust based on a thing call malibdinum.

What Is Assembli Theory?
Summary:
assembly theory is a theory. Goes back a few years now. And my struggle for maybe almost ten years, when i was going to origin of life conferences and artificial life conferences,.

So,
Speaker 1
assembly theory is a theory. Goes back a few years now. And my struggle for maybe almost ten years, when i was going to origin of life conferences and artificial life conferences, where i thought that everybody was dancing around a the problem of what life is, what it does. But i'lltel ou about what assembly theory is ease, the thing is easier. So assembly theory literally says, if you take an object, any given object, and you are able to break that object into parts very gently, so just maybe tet's say, take a piece of very intricate chinese porcelain, and you tap it just with a hammer, ir the nail at some point, and it will fragment into many parts. And if that object is able to fragment into many and you count those those parts, the different parts, they're unsymmetrical. An assembli theory says the the larger the number of parts, unsymmetrical parts, that object has, the more likely it is that object has been created by an evolutionary or information process, especially if that object is not one off, you've got an abundance of them. And that's really important, ye arbund ant i and i so because if you what i'm literally saying about the abundance, if you have a one off object and you break it into parts, and it has lots of lots of

Is There Something Fundamental That Allows Us to Feel Free?
Summary:
In assembly theory, if we're thinking about free will, where does the little bit of freedom come from? What is the eye they can decide to be a wrapper what? Why? Is there something fundamental that allows us to feel free, to be free? That's the question i want to answer. I would say that i don't take the stants of sam harris, cause i think sam harris almost thinks himself out of existence, right? Bsio, because do you know what i mean? Ye. Well, oh, he has different views onconsciousness. Is f fe will.
Transcript:
Speaker 2
You're, you're really operating in a world of constraints that are constrained by the memory of the trajectory, of the chemistry that led to who you are, ok? But, ah, you know,
Speaker 1
even just a tiny bit of freedom,
Speaker 2
even if everything, if everywhere you are in cages, if you can move around in that cage a little bit, you're free. I
Speaker 1
agree.
Speaker 2
And so the question is, in assembly theory, if we're thinking about free will, where does the little bit of freedom come from? What is the eye they can decide to be a wrapper what? Why? What is that that's a cute little trick we've convinced each other of so we can do fun tricks at parties, or is there something fundamental that allows us to feel free, to be free?
Speaker 1
I think, tat, that's the question that i want to answer. I know you want to answer it, and i think it's so profound, i let me go at it. I would say that i don't take the stants of sam harris, cause i think sam harris, when he says the way he says it, is almost, it's really interesting. I'd love to talk to him about it. Sam harris almost thinks himself out of existence, right? Bsio, because do you know what i mean? Ye. Well, oh, he has different views onconsciousness. Is f fe will.

Free Will Is a Complex Interaction Between Your Conscious and Your Unconscious
Summary:
Some people out source their free will to ther unconscious brain, and some people try and overthink free will in the conscious brain. I would say that sam harris has realized his conscious brain doesn't have free will, but his unconscious brain does. And it makes me more radical, if you like. You know, as er that i get to explore more fto state space. And i'm like, i'm going to try and affect the world now. That's one of my favorite things about being a writer.
Transcript:
Speaker 1
why. I think free will is actually very complex interaction between your conscious your unconscious and your conscious brain. Andth, i think the reason why we're arguing about it so so interesting in that, and weve just, some people er out source their free will to ther unconscious brain, and some people try and overthink free will in the conscious brain. I would say that sam harris has realized his conscious brain doesn't have free will, but his unconscious brain does. That's my guess, right? And that he can't have as the unconscious er. And that's kind of annoying. And, but then, so he's just, he's
Speaker 2
going to, through meditation, come to acceptance oth that fact,
Speaker 1
yes, fishes may be ok, or maybe. But i do think that i have the ability to make decisions, and i like my decisionsn mean, thit is an argument i havewither some people that, er, some days i feelthat i have no free will, and it's just an illusion. And this is one. And it makes me more radical, if you like. You know, as er that i get to explore more fto state space. And i'm like, i'm going to try and affect the world now. I'm really going to ask the question that maybe i dare not ask, or darenotor do the thing i dare not do.
