What does carbon neutral actually mean
Summary:
A net zero energy system means every hour of the day you are not relying on fossil fuel. It is better than nothing, and it is not enough," he says. "We have to do what we canDo now, and we also have to push to do much more"

electricity, you call that net zero. But it's not actually not relying on fossil fuels at all. Because almost definitely, what you are doing is producing those hundred kilowats during some portions of the day, but not all portions of the day. So you are selling some of the energy that you produce back to the grid. And then at night time, when there isn't solar electricity being generated, you are still relying on fossil fuel powered energy. So then you have a third thing that's called 24 seven, a net zero. And that means every hour of the day you are not relying on fossil fuel. All these things do different things. All these things encourage different a innovation a in so if you are doing 24 seven, you're enovating in battery as well as in solar. And and other renewables. If you are not doing 24 seven, you're ennovating in lik grid management, and youre ennovate. And if you are also doing offsets, then you're ennovating and carbon capture. So all these things do different things, but they are all definitely better than not doing anything. Right? Was
Speaker 1
that half an hour? I wasn't quite half an hour a so i appreciate your relative pitbut i think that, i think, but i think those are all really important points. It is better than nothing, and it is not enough. Ar, those are going to be some of the catch phrases for the next ten years. We have to do what we can do now, and we also have to push to do much more.
Speaker 2
Ye. I mean, i should say that 24 seven, a carbonless energy, wasn't for a large scale operation. You know, you could obviously do this if you had an off grit home or something. But, you know, that's a lot, that's a goal that a lot of, like, bigger, specifically tet companies, have now. And it was not like, five years ago, it was not something you could even aspire toward, like that
