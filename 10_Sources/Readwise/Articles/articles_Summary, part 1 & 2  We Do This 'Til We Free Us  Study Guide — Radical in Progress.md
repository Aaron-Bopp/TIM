###### ^212884722q

For Kaba, prison abolition goes far past just abolishing prisons, surveillance, and policing; it is a complete overhaul of how society is structured, what roles institutions play in society, and how we manage conflict and harm.

###### ^212884910q

While these steps provide a more general overview, Kaba also covers what immediate steps can be taken to work towards prison abolition: 
1. “Organizing for dramatic decreases of police budgets and redirecting those funds to other social goods (defunding the police)” (p. 13). 
2. “Ending cash bail” (*ibid*).
3. “Overturning police bills of rights” (*ibid*).
4. “Abolishing police unions” (*ibid*).
5. “Crowding out the police in our communities” (*ibid*).
6. “Disarming the police” (*ibid*).
7. “Creating abolitionist messages that penetrate the public consciousness to disrupt the idea that cops = safety” (*ibid*).
8. “Building community-based interventions that address harms without relying on police” (*ibid*).
9. “Evaluating any reforms based on these criteria” (*ibid*).
10. “Thinking through the end of the police and imagining alternatives” (*ibid*).

The system isn't broken it is working exactly as intended  

###### ^212885456q

People (mostly white) will often be upset and start to argue that the policing system is broken and needs to be fixed through strategies like more racial bias training, more positive interactions between young Black children and the police, and more body cams to avoid these killings in the future.

###### ^212885717q

Criminality and Blackness have become synonymous and police are responsible for upholding the idea that Black people are dangerous and need to be controlled

###### ^212888918q

Kaba states, “I always tell people, for me, hope doesn’t preclude feeling sadness or frustration or anger or any other emotion that makes total sense. Hope isn’t an emotion, you know? Hope is not optimism” (p. 26). Kaba views hope as something you practice, a philosophy that is essential in the sustained fight for prison abolition.

###### ^212892693q

Kaba is the co-founder of an organization called Survived and Punished that focuses on **criminalized survivors**. Criminalized survivors are people (often Black women) who are charged with a crime, even though they were protecting themselves from sexual, physical, or mental violence

###### ^212893660q

Cyntoia specifically explained that it was survival sex work that led to her situation, yet the media was quick to change the narrative that Cyntoia was a child sex slave. Kaba critiques this changing of narrative, mentioning **how important it is to use the same language as the victims and how sensationalist coverage erases many of the nuances and complexities that go along with being involved in the sex/street industries**

###### ^212893709q

Additionally, the system does not bring justice to survivors. In fact, it often just retraumatizes survivors as they are forced to go through the trial and prosecution of their abusers. Real justice for survivors could look like therapy, monetary redistribution, and/or safe places to live away from where the abuse happened. Real consequences for perpetrators could look like public apologies, therapy, loss of jobs, and/or the inability to hold high positions
