###### ^217372340q

###### ^217372341q

##### ^217372342

  


###### ^217372342q

##### ^217372343

  


###### ^217372343q

> obliviousness about white advantage, like obliviousness about male advantage, is kept strongly inculturated in the United States so as to maintain the myth of meritocracy, the myth that democratic choice is equally available to all
