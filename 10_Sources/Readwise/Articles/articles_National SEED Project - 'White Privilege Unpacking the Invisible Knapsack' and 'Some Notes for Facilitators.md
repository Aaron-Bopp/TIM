# Highlights
##### ^217372324
  
> men’s unwillingness to grant that they are over-privileged, even though they may grant that women are disadvantaged 

##### ^217372325
  
> whites are carefully taught not to recognize white privilege, as males are taught not to recognize male privilege 

##### ^217372326
  
> White privilege is like an invisible weightless knapsack of special provisions, maps, passports, codebooks, visas, clothes, tools and blank checks 

##### ^217372327
  
> After I realized the extent to which men work from a base of unacknowledged privilege, I understood that much of their oppressiveness was unconscious. 

##### ^217372328
  
> I can if I wish arrange to be in the company of people of my race most of the time. 

##### ^217372329
  
> When I am told about our national heritage or about “civilization,” I am shown that people of my color made it what it is. 

##### ^217372330
  
> I can go into a music shop and count on finding the music of my race represented, into a supermarket and find the staple foods that fit with my cultural traditions, into a hairdresser’s shop and find someone who can cut my hair. 

##### ^217372331
  
> I can do well in a challenging situation without being called a credit to my race. 

##### ^217372332
  
> I am never asked to speak for all the people of my racial group. 

##### ^217372333
  
> I can criticize our government and talk about how much I fear its policies and behavior without being seen as a cultural outsider. 

##### ^217372334
  
> I can go home from most meetings of organizations I belong to feeling somewhat tied in, rather than isolated, out-of-place, outnumbered, unheard, held at a distance, or feared. 

##### ^217372335
  
> I can choose public accommodations without fearing that people of my race cannot get in or will be mistreated in the places I have chosen. 

##### ^217372336
  
> I can be sure that if I need legal or medical help, my race will not work against me. 

##### ^217372337
  
> My skin color was an asset for any move I was educated to want to make 

##### ^217372338
  
> We usually think of privilege as being a favored state, whether earned or conferred by birth or luck. Yet some of the conditions I have described here work systematically to overempower certain groups. 

##### ^217372339
  
> I have met very few men who are truly distressed about systemic, unearned male advantage and conferred dominance. And so one question for me and others like me is whether we will be like them, or whether we will get truly distressed, even outraged, about unearned race advantage and conferred dominance, and, if so, what will we do to lessen them 

##### ^217372340
  
> In addition, since race and sex are not the only advantaging systems at work, we need similarly to examine the daily experience of having age advantage, or ethnic advantage, or physical ability, or advantage related to nationality, religion, or sexual orientation. 

##### ^217372341
  
> One factor seems clear about all of the interlocking oppressions. They take both active forms, which we can see, and embedded forms 

##### ^217372342
  
> I did not see myself as a racist because I was taught to recognize racism only in individual acts of meanness by members of my group, never in invisible systems conferring unsought racial dominance on my group from birth 

##### ^217372343
  
> obliviousness about white advantage, like obliviousness about male advantage, is kept strongly inculturated in the United States so as to maintain the myth of meritocracy, the myth that democratic choice is equally available to all
