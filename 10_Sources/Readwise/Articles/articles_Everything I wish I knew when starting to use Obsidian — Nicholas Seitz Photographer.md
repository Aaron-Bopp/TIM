###### ^242106792q

**Gall’s Law; every functional complex system emerges out of a simpler system that worked first.** Put another way, in a phrase that I’ve heard bouncing around (I’m about 80% sure it’s a Nick Milo phrase): you have to earn complexity.

###### ^242106880q

It’s important that you come up with a durable and realistic answer though, because this pile of notes is primarily for you.

###### ^242106930q

The insight happens in *your* brain, but when you share it with others, when that insight propagates, **what is that but fruit?**

###### ^242106934q

So as you have new insights, recognize that that is the desired product of your work

This is not always true for people with hyper fixations  

###### ^242106994q

Taking notes is work. It is always harder than doing nothing

all you need to do to reduce friction is trim the edges. If it feels like more than that you're probably trying to fit a square plug in a round hole  

###### ^242107395q

Pruning is not tearing up the entire plant and starting over.

###### ^242107577q

Understand what **fruitfulness** looks like when using your vault, and continue working at it such that that fruit can actually **grow.** Over time, you will experience the **friction** of unproductive processes. Where there is the most friction, simply **prune** those processes out of your workflow and continue working.
