I think this feeling comes more from the our knowledge of how far technology can take us, and less from it being less transformative than older systems.  

###### ^306125209q

it’s difficult not to be
disappointed, to feel that computers have not yet been nearly
as transformative as far older tools for thought, such as
language and writing.

a
medium creates a powerful immersive context, a context in
which the user can have new kinds of thought, thoughts that
were formerly impossible for them

the term “tools for thought” has
been widely used since Iverson’s 1950s and 1960s
work An account may be found in
Iverson’s Turing Award
lecture, Notation as a Tool
of Thought (1979). Incidentally, even Iverson is really
describing a medium for thought, the APL programming language,
not a narrow tool.

###### ^306125212q

there’s an inherent
inadequacy in writing about tools for thought. To the extent
that such a tool succeeds, it expands your thinking beyond
what can be achieved using existing tools, including
writing. The more transformative the tool, the larger the gap
that is opened. Conversely, the larger the gap, the more
difficult the new tool is to evoke in writing. But what
writing can do, and the reason we wrote this essay, is act as
a bootstrap. It’s a way of identifying points of leverage that
may help develop new tools for thought.

###### ^306125213q

Aspirationally, the mnemonic medium makes it
almost effortless for users to remember what they read.

This would be vital in making learning as easy as thinking  

###### ^306125214q

Is it possible to
design a new medium which much more actively supports
memorization? That is, the medium would build in (and, ideally,
make almost effortless) the key steps involved in memory
