technique for marking more complex text.  

###### ^305310567q

I circle terms which are being defined and write a D for Definition in the margin.
When the author elaborates a model, I put an M or μ in the margin and maybe highlight key terms she uses.
If I spot an argument, I put an A or α in the margin and sometimes draw a vertical line in the margin to designate the passage.
Everytime I find a weakness in the argument or disagree due to a different starting point, I put a bolt glyph in the margin.
