###### ^261781010q

withdrawing from your 401(k) before age 59½ is an option, but consider it a last resort. That’s because early withdrawals incur a 10% penalty on top of normal income taxes.

###### ^261781025q

Consider the consequences of a 30-year-old withdrawing just $5,000 from his 401(k). Had the money been left in the account, it alone would have been worth over $33,000 by the time he turns 60.

###### ^261781029q

you may qualify for what’s known as a [hardship withdrawal](https://smartasset.com/retirement/411-401k-hardship-distributions) and avoid paying the 10% early distribution tax. While the IRS defines a hardship as “an immediate and heavy financial need,” your 401(k) plan will ultimately decide whether you are eligible for a hardship withdrawal and not all plans will offer one.

###### ^261781283q

401(k) loans cannot exceed $50,000 or 50% of the vested account balance. That means if you have $60,000 in your 401(k), you can borrow up to $30,000. And while normal 401(k) contributions are tax-deductible, loan payments are not.
