> With personal knowledge management (PKM), we seek to learn and grow, to understand and communicate, and to influence behavior (especially our own) so that we achieve better outcomes for ourselves and others

###### ^292182860q

> See, crows are actually pretty smart. They knew that whenever people entered those woods they always came out. So, the crows waited for that third dude and when he finally showed up and left the way he came, the crows knew the coast was clear. ... When five guys went in and only four returned, the crows came out of hiding. Evidently, they couldn’t discriminate beyond the level of three units and their perceptual-mathematical ability consisted of a sequence such as one-two-three-*many*.

> When five guys went in and only four returned, the crows came out of hiding. Evidently, they couldn’t discriminate beyond the level of three units and their perceptual-mathematical ability consisted of a sequence such as one-two-three-*many*. ... Now, you might think that a man’s perceptual ability is greater than that of a crow, but as it turns out, it’s not by much: we may hold five or six units at most.

> Now, you might think that a man’s perceptual ability is greater than that of a crow, but as it turns out, it’s not by much: we may hold five or six units at most. ... The next step of the process involves *integration,* wherein we blend similar units into a single new mental entity based on something or several things similar about them.

> Words are the things that transform concepts into mental entities. And even though most words are abstractions, they ultimately represent concretes in reality — the things we perceive directly with our senses: *percepts*.

> A concept is a mental integration of two or more units possessing the same distinguishing characteristic(s), with their particular measurements omitted.

> Finally, we replace the concept with a single, specific, *perceptual* concrete — a placeholder that differentiates it from all other concretes and all other concepts: **a word**. This is the function of language.
