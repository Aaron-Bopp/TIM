Undiscovered Animals
Where most of the discovery work still needs doing is with invertebrate animals, creatures without backbones. Taxonomists have classified only one-fifth of all invertebrate species.
About four million insects have not yet been examined and named. Another half million spiders and their relatives are still unidentified. Plus hundreds of thousands of aquatic creatures, ranging from snails to sponges, remain mysterious.
Unknown Plants
There are still nearly one-fifth of vascular plants left to discover, not including an unknown number of plant algae species. While scientists have documented nearly all the coniferous plants, these make up a tiny fraction of all plant species. Thousands of the world's flower, fern and moss species are new to science and have yet to be recorded.
