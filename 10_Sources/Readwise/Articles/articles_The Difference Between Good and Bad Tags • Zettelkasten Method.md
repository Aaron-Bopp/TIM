There are two different types of tags: 
Tags for topics. You use tags to group notes under a topic. 
Tags for objects. You use tags to group notes around an object, real or conceptual.

Tags linked in the body of my notes are for topics, this note is somehow related to that. Tags linked in the "Topics:": field are for objects, this note is primarily about this topic.

If I use tags for topics I would tag everything that is relevant for the topic of diet with \#diet. A note about carbohydrate intake and insulin sensitivity would definitely fulfill this criterion. If I use tags for objects, I would only tag notes with \#diet when these notes are specifically on the concept of dieting. I would not tag the note on insulin sensitivity with \#diet.
