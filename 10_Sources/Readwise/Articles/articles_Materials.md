> So the ``hint'' describes the context. This is VERY IMPORTANT!
> The context is fresh in your mind when you get the thought! It would take a while to recognize the thought, and then identify the context, if you didn't.
> I used to try to think of every context a thought could fit in, and then try to place it in as many places as I could. WHILE THIS IS THE STRATEGY TO PURSUE WHEN USING A COMPUTER SYSTEM[6](https://users.speakeasy.net/~lion/nb/html/doc005.html/footnotes.html\#000006), this is NOT the strategy to pursue in the paper system!
> Besides, the thought is MOST useful in the ORIGINAL context, 95the time.
> And your hint- that's going to be USED. In some respects, it's EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE THOUGHT ITSELF! Because, as you will see if you do this for a while, it is STRUCTURE and INTEGRATION that is important- the actual contents of the thoughts are far less meaningful. Once you have the structure in front of you, the content because almost obvious..! We'll use that fact in a bit, as we shorten titles to just Speed Numbers. Don't worry about that now, though.
