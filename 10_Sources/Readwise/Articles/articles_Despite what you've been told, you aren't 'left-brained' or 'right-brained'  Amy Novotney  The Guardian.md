## Highlights
  
> "The neuroscience community has never accepted the idea of 'left-dominant' or 'right-dominant' personality types. Lesion studies don't support it, and the truth is that it would be highly inefficient for one half of the brain to consistently be more active than the other"   [View Highlight](https://theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/16/left-right-brain-distinction-myth?__readwiseLocation=0%2F1%2F1%2F11%2F0%2F0%2F0%2F0%2F7%2F0%2F0%2F8%3A0%2C0%2F1%2F1%2F11%2F0%2F0%2F0%2F0%2F7%2F0%2F0%2F8%3A270#:~:text=The%20neuroscience%20community%20has%20never%2Cmore%20active%20than%20the%20other)

  
> "Similar to the [Myers-Briggs test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator) – another widely used personality test with limited scientific evidence – the left-brained/right-brained thinker theory provides us with an explanation for why we are the way we are, and offers insights into where we fit into the world"   [View Highlight](https://theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/16/left-right-brain-distinction-myth?__readwiseLocation=0%2F14%2F0%2F0%2F0%2F0%2F7%2F0%2F0%2F8%3A0%2C2%2F14%2F0%2F0%2F0%2F0%2F7%2F0%2F0%2F8%3A236#:~:text=Similar%20to%20the%20Myers-Briggs%20test%2Cwe%20fit%20into%20the%20world)

  
> "The problems start, however, when the left-brained/right-brained myth becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. When your 12-year-old fills out an online personality test that pegs her as a "right-brainer" and she decides to skip her math homework – because the test told her she isn't good with numbers – the persistence of this false dichotomy starts to become destructive."
