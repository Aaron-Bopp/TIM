###### ^217232860q

literature pits identity blindness (e.g., color blindness) against identity consciousness (e.g., multiculturalism), 

^217232860

##### ^217232861



###### ^217232861q

Color blindness has ego-protective features 

^217232861

##### ^217232862



###### ^217232862q

the literature suggests that, with some exceptions, color blindness has negative implications for interracial interactions, minorities’ perceptions and outcomes, and the pursuit of diversity and inclusion in organizational contexts 

^217232862

##### ^217232863



###### ^217232863q

The research reviewed coalesces to suggest that while multiculturalism generally has more positive implications for people of color, both models have the potential to further inequality.

###### ^217232865q

groups associated with perpetrating racism (e.g., Whites) maintain an egalitarian self-image, because it allows them to believe they are nonprejudiced and are self-presenting as such 

^217232865

##### ^217232866



###### ^217232866q

Whites’ use of color blindness in interracial interaction correlates with exter-nal motivation to control prejudice 

^217232866

##### ^217232867



###### ^217232867q

When threat-ened, White Americans high in social dominance orienta-tion (i.e., preference for group-based hierarchy) use color blindness to defend the status quo 

^217232867

##### ^217232868



###### ^217232868q

Color blind-ness removes the plausibility of racism and, therefore, the opportunity for addressing it. 

^217232868

##### ^217232869



###### ^217232869q

Children in the color-blind condition perceived racism less and recalled events in ways less likely to alert teachers to rac-ism occurring 

^217232869

##### ^217232870



###### ^217232870q

Whites tended to avoid mentioning race when playing with a Black partner, but ironically, the strategy prompted a perception of them as more biased 

^217232870

##### ^217232871



###### ^217232871q

color-blindness-abiding Whites showed more cognitive impairment and less ability to inhibit negative nonverbal behaviors.

###### ^217232872q

If there is evidence of the institution’s commitment to diversity, however, a mes-sage that stresses equal opportunity may be more moti-vating to people of color than one that focuses only on tolerance and diversity efforts, especially when their representation is low

###### ^217721945q

Why is it dif-ficult for some people to embrace multiculturalism? One key factor is threat. 

^217721945

##### ^217721946



###### ^217721946q

Another possible reason relates to belonging. Diversity tends to be associated with non-White groups (Unzueta & Binning, 2010), and Whites can feel excluded by multiculturalism (Plaut, Garnett, Buffardi, & Sanchez-Burks, 2011).

It seems multiculturalism has complex effects on [[society]]  

###### ^217721947q

Some research suggests that support for multicultural ideology relates to less stereotyping (Hachfeld et al., 2015; Velasco González et al., 2008), whereas other research points to greater stereotyping (Wolsko, Park, Judd, & Wittenbrink, 2000). However, in the latter case, stereotyping does not necessarily link to lower regard for ethnic minorities among Whites or ability to use indi-viduating information. With regard to prejudice, Whites and people of color who endorse multiculturalism show lower prejudice (Ryan et al., 2007; Wolsko et al., 2006) 

^217721947

###### ^217721948q

Exposure to a multicultural passage temporarily reduces implicit prejudice (Lai et al., 2014) and results in less implicit and explicit prejudice than color blindness 

^217721948

##### ^217721949



###### ^217721949q

Multiculturalism can also have positive implications for interracial interaction, engagement, performance, and detection of discrimination 

^217721949

##### ^217721950



###### ^217721950q

exposure to a multicultural university statement (stressing strength in and embracing diversity) yielded better performance for women of color than a color-blind statement (stressing similarity and that social iden-tities are immaterial; Wilton et al., 2015). 

^217721950

##### ^217721951



###### ^217721951q

Whites exposed to multiculturalism displayed more hos-tility in an interracial interaction after being threatened 

^217721951

##### ^217721952



###### ^217721952q

Highlighting an organization’s diversity initiatives can also undermine detection of discrimination. Their pres-ence can create a deceptive impression of organiza-tional fairness, such that high-status group members are less likely to identify discriminatory behavior against low-status group members (Kaiser et al., 2013). 

^217721952

##### ^217721953



###### ^217721953q

Color blindness, while often heralded as a remedy for racism, can foster negative outcomes for people of color (e.g., interper-sonal discrimination). Moreover, color blindness serves to reify the social order, as it allows Whites to see them-selves as nonprejudiced, can be used to defend current racial hierarchies, and diminishes sensitivity to racism. 

^217721953

##### ^217721954



###### ^217721954q

Multiculturalism can provoke threat and prejudice in Whites, but multicultural practices can positively affect outcomes and participation of people of color in differ-ent institutional arenas. Yet it also has the potential to caricature and demotivate them and mask discrimina-tion.
