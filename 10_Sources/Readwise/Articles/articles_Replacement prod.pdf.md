> literature pits identity blindness (e.g., color blindness) against identity consciousness (e.g., multiculturalism), 

##### ^217232861
  
> Color blindness has ego-protective features 

##### ^217232862
  
> the literature suggests that, with some exceptions, color blindness has negative implications for interracial interactions, minorities’ perceptions and outcomes, and the pursuit of diversity and inclusion in organizational contexts 

##### ^217232863
  
> The research reviewed coalesces to suggest that while multiculturalism generally has more positive implications for people of color, both models have the potential to further inequality.

> groups associated with perpetrating racism (e.g., Whites) maintain an egalitarian self-image, because it allows them to believe they are nonprejudiced and are self-presenting as such 

##### ^217232866
  
> Whites’ use of color blindness in interracial interaction correlates with exter-nal motivation to control prejudice 

##### ^217232867
  
> When threat-ened, White Americans high in social dominance orienta-tion (i.e., preference for group-based hierarchy) use color blindness to defend the status quo 

##### ^217232868
  
> Color blind-ness removes the plausibility of racism and, therefore, the opportunity for addressing it. 

##### ^217232869
  
> Children in the color-blind condition perceived racism less and recalled events in ways less likely to alert teachers to rac-ism occurring 

##### ^217232870
  
> Whites tended to avoid mentioning race when playing with a Black partner, but ironically, the strategy prompted a perception of them as more biased 

##### ^217232871
  
> color-blindness-abiding Whites showed more cognitive impairment and less ability to inhibit negative nonverbal behaviors. 

##### ^217232872
  
> If there is evidence of the institution’s commitment to diversity, however, a mes-sage that stresses equal opportunity may be more moti-vating to people of color than one that focuses only on tolerance and diversity efforts, especially when their representation is low 

##### ^217721945
  
> Why is it dif-ficult for some people to embrace multiculturalism? One key factor is threat. 

##### ^217721946
  
> Another possible reason relates to belonging. Diversity tends to be associated with non-White groups (Unzueta & Binning, 2010), and Whites can feel excluded by multiculturalism (Plaut, Garnett, Buffardi, & Sanchez-Burks, 2011). 

##### ^217721947
It seems multiculturalism has complex effects on society  
> Some research suggests that support for multicultural ideology relates to less stereotyping (Hachfeld et al., 2015; Velasco González et al., 2008), whereas other research points to greater stereotyping (Wolsko, Park, Judd, & Wittenbrink, 2000). However, in the latter case, stereotyping does not necessarily link to lower regard for ethnic minorities among Whites or ability to use indi-viduating information. With regard to prejudice, Whites and people of color who endorse multiculturalism show lower prejudice (Ryan et al., 2007; Wolsko et al., 2006) 

##### ^217721948
  
> Exposure to a multicultural passage temporarily reduces implicit prejudice (Lai et al., 2014) and results in less implicit and explicit prejudice than color blindness 

##### ^217721949
  
> Multiculturalism can also have positive implications for interracial interaction, engagement, performance, and detection of discrimination 

##### ^217721950
  
> exposure to a multicultural university statement (stressing strength in and embracing diversity) yielded better performance for women of color than a color-blind statement (stressing similarity and that social iden-tities are immaterial; Wilton et al., 2015). 

##### ^217721951
  
> Whites exposed to multiculturalism displayed more hos-tility in an interracial interaction after being threatened 

##### ^217721952
  
> Highlighting an organization’s diversity initiatives can also undermine detection of discrimination. Their pres-ence can create a deceptive impression of organiza-tional fairness, such that high-status group members are less likely to identify discriminatory behavior against low-status group members (Kaiser et al., 2013). 

##### ^217721953
  
> Color blindness, while often heralded as a remedy for racism, can foster negative outcomes for people of color (e.g., interper-sonal discrimination). Moreover, color blindness serves to reify the social order, as it allows Whites to see them-selves as nonprejudiced, can be used to defend current racial hierarchies, and diminishes sensitivity to racism. 

##### ^217721954
  
> Multiculturalism can provoke threat and prejudice in Whites, but multicultural practices can positively affect outcomes and participation of people of color in differ-ent institutional arenas. Yet it also has the potential to caricature and demotivate them and mask discrimina-tion.
