> e semantic embedding of a document is a set of spatial coordinates, a finite list of numbers which indicate its location in space. Notably, this is not a physical space, and the document coordinates are not related to latitude and longitude. Rather, documents live in a *semantic space*, a space of possible meanings, with way more than three dimensions. Clever statistical models take on the task of *projecting* individual documents onto semantic space automatically, providing the actual coordinates. The semantic embedding of a document is strictly a function of its contents, with nothing else influencing its location. As dimensions of meaning are expressed as dimensions of space, documents which mean similar things are to be found close to each other in semantic space.
