> If choice is present, its cousin named “opportunity cost” will be there, too. That means that if you follow one link, you didn’t follow another. If you have the intention to come back from the referenced note to the linking note you are more inclined to not follow a link that leads you further away from the “source note”. This might not seem like a big deal to you. However, if you reach a stage of complexity with your Zettelkasten in which it develops its true productivity, choice and accompanying opportunity cost will be a major factor.
