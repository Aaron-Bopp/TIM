## Highlights
  
> "*Turing machine*: a single, universal programmable computing device that Turing argued could perform any algorithm whatsoever."

> "Is there a (single) universal computing device which can efficiently simulate *any* other physical system?"

> "you wouldnâ€™t need to rely on informal, heuristic arguments to justify your notion of algorithm, as Turing had done. You could use the laws of physics to prove your device was universal."

> "a *quantum computer*. Those quantum computers can do everything conventional computers can do, but are also capable of efficiently simulating quantum-mechanical processes. And so they are arguably a more natural computing model than conventional computers"   [View Highlight](https://quantum.country/qcvc?__readwiseLocation=3%2F27%2F1%2F1%2F3%3A197%2C5%2F27%2F1%2F1%2F3%3A235#:~:text=a%20quantum%20computer.%20Those%20quantum%2Ccomputing%20model%20than%20conventional%20computers)
