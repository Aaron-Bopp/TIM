> "**Transformative justice**, as Kaba defines it, is “a community process developed by anti-violence activists of color, in particular, who wanted to create responses to violence that do what criminal punishment systems fail to do: build support and more safety for the person harmed, figure out how the broader context was set up for this harm to happen, and how that context can be changed so that this harm is less likely to happen again” (p. 59)."

Punishment of an individual does nothing unless it discourages other perpetrators  
> "Nassar was ultimately given over 100 years in jail, with the judge presiding over the case famously stating at the end of the trial “I just signed your death warrant.” Kaba challenges how successful this trial really was,"   [View Highlight](https://radicalinprogress.org/kaba-2021-3?__readwiseLocation=0%2F8%2F0%2F0%2F0%2F0%2F1%2F1%2F3%2F3%2F1%2F5%2F1%3A182%2C0%2F8%2F0%2F0%2F0%2F0%2F1%2F1%2F3%2F3%2F1%2F5%2F1%3A404#:~:text=Nassar%20was%20ultimately%20given%20over%2Csuccessful%20this%20trial%20really%20was%2C)

  
> "Instead of focusing on arresting killer cops, Kaba argues for the direction of energies to go towards “collective strategies that are more likely to be successful in delivering healing and transformation and to prevent future harms. Families and communities deserve more than heartbreak over and over again each time the system declines to hold itself accountable”"   [View Highlight](https://radicalinprogress.org/kaba-2021-3?__readwiseLocation=2%2F10%2F0%2F0%2F0%2F0%2F1%2F1%2F3%2F3%2F1%2F5%2F1%3A1%2C2%2F10%2F0%2F0%2F0%2F0%2F1%2F1%2F3%2F3%2F1%2F5%2F1%3A366#:~:text=Instead%20of%20focusing%20on%20arresting%2Cdeclines%20to%20hold%20itself%20accountable%E2%80%9D)

[[Healing and repair is the alternative to punitive justice]]  
> "Kaba challenges punitive impulses and instead argues for a shift to healing and repair. In a case like Nassar’s, healing and repair would mean:
> 1. Believing the survivors the first time they spoke up,
> 2. Seeking to understand what it is that caused the acts of violence in the first place,
> 3. Maintaining the humanity of the perpetrator,
> 4. Getting to the root of the issue such as critiquing the way the USA gymnastics team handled allegations and dismantling the misogyny and sexism that lead to sexual assault."
