Likely the best way to achieve this is on a platform with shortform introductory content that can then funnel you to high quality longform content.

It goes without saying that looking for incepting (or just highly extending) material is a high-risk strategy. It’ll be topics you’re not already interested in so you won’t know if you could be, and you won’t know how to separate the wheat from the chaff either. ... A recommendation engine for reading that could reliably supply enjoyable inceptive experiences would be a marvel.
