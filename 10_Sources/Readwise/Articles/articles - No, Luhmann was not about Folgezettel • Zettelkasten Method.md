###### ^273533338q

Should you copy a method just because Luhmann used it? I certainly don’t. Luhmann dealt with the flaws of a physical Zettelkasten and developed techniques to actualize a principle. As a user of a digital solution, we have other, even better, choices.

###### ^273533380q

I am not entirely against categories. In fact, I find them quite useful. I use tags extensively because of that. Tags include the functionality of categories but not the other way around. I have a good chunk of Zettel written on the idea of *metabolic flexibility*. All the Zettel I have written on that topic have this tag. This way I end up with something that works exactly like a *metabolic flexibility* category, only without the limitations of a hierarchical system of strict categories.

###### ^273533420q

How you realize a principle, that is which technique you use, does not make any difference from a bird’s eye perspective.
