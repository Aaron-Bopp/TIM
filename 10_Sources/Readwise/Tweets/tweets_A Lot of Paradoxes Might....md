> a lot of paradoxes might be best resolved with a sense of humor 
> (eg: dicking around can be productive, but if you're anxious about *being* productive, that typically ruins the whole thing)
> the conflict creates a vortex that can be anxiety-inducing, until you see the joke

> once you see the joke and you can laugh about it, you can often "step outside" the vortex of the paradox, and navigate it as you see fit, either steering into or out of it as you wish, choosing a side based on the context, playing both sides at once, neither, etc
