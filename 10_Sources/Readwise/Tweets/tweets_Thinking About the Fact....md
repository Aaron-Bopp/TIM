> Thinking about the fact Autistic people are pattern seekers. Then how education is very prescriptive and linear. It’s designed entirely for people who need less information to succeed, and completely ignores those who need more. In my case it definitely destroyed me.

> I’ve been trying to work out why I managed to learn math through Khan Academy when I couldn’t learn it at school. Then I looked at what I did modules in. Turns out it was learning heaps about the subject to learn the underlying rules. I need access to lots at the same time.

> In school I got told off for reading ahead. I got told off for referencing stuff in other subjects. I got told off for not applying information in the designated prescriptive way. I’ve also realise that’s why video games helped me to excel, I made up all deficits in games.

> I need to be immersed in information to understand something. There needs to be signposts too - completely uncommented code for example is a nightmare - but random access learning and trial and error is the fastest way I learn on my own, and I prefer it. Then I share.

> I’m a ping pong ball learner, because in many ways that is how my brain works. It’s random webs of information loosely held together in abstract categories. It’s not a neatly organised system. It’s ordered chaos. I basically constantly run down dead ends until I succeed.
