> Thinking about the fact Autistic people are pattern seekers. Then how education is very prescriptive and linear. It’s designed entirely for people who need less information to succeed, and completely ignores those who need more. In my case it definitely destroyed me.

> I’ve been trying to work out why I managed to learn math through Khan Academy when I couldn’t learn it at school. Then I looked at what I did modules in. Turns out it was learning heaps about the subject to learn the underlying rules. I need access to lots at the same time.

##### ^247739597
  
> In school I got told off for reading ahead. I got told off for referencing stuff in other subjects. I got told off for not applying information in the designated prescriptive way. I’ve also realise that’s why video games helped me to excel, I made up all deficits in games.

##### ^247739598
  
> I need to be immersed in information to understand something. There needs to be signposts too - completely uncommented code for example is a nightmare - but random access learning and trial and error is the fastest way I learn on my own, and I prefer it. Then I share.

> I’m a ping pong ball learner, because in many ways that is how my brain works. It’s random webs of information loosely held together in abstract categories. It’s not a neatly organised system. It’s ordered chaos. I basically constantly run down dead ends until I succeed.

> Of all the things I’ve been addicted to in my life. Knowledge is the strongest one. I just want to know anything, as long as it’s interesting. I just have trouble accessing it conventionally due to an unconventional mind. The potential my teachers saw was held back by delivery.

> I’m not an autodidact because I want to be different, I’m an autodidact because it’s the only way I can learn.

> There’s another thing I do that seems to hack my brain. In Beat Saber the fastest way for me to make progress wasn’t to do stuff linearly according to difficult, it was to constantly do stuff miles outside my range, then drop back. Like complexity makes simplicity for me somehow.

> Learning the fundamentals isn’t how you teach me, you keep dropping me in the deep end, then I trace my way back to get there as soon as I can. This is the only way I can really explain it.

> I remember reading the entire Redwall series when I was 10 when I was behind at this point (due to undiagnosed dyslexia). I had to have a dictionary with me all the time, but in intermediate it was more than self directed learning, I just needed the right tools. That librarian.❤️

> Then teachers, other students, and family members kept mocking me when I said words incorrectly but used them in the right context. Pronunciation was always hard for me. Reading out loud was hard due to word issues and [[judgement]].

##### ^247906191
  
> My dyslexia is not that much of an issue anymore except in very specific circumstances. Accessibility stuff like auto check for spelling and typing made it easy. I can’t do anagrams unless letterboxed (the first and last character need to be the same, then spatial form is intact)

##### ^247906192
  
> But yeah, all my learning disabilities now I realise I got over and I mean all of them, by giving me more complexity - not less. I found the simplicity inside the complexity. Which means school was not ever the right way for me to learn.

##### ^247906193
  
> It sucks too. I wasted my teenage years and early 20s basically believing I sucked at learning stuff - the one thing it did ‘teach’ me is that I was stupid, and I shouldn’t try. 😥

##### ^247906258
  
> Thank god for passive learning in games. Seriously. I keep coming back to games. Because they basically sustained my ability to gain knowledge and stretched that muscle till I started trying again.
