"Many people with ADD have noticed that a strange drowsiness may come over them in the midst of some emotionally charged situations, as, for example, during a conflict with a spouse. All of a sudden, they start yawning and their eyelids grow heavy.

Their partners naturally believe that the drowsiness is a sign of boredom and a lack of caring.

There's also the reverse of this. Where extreme anxiety is triggered, the main premise of this part is that distraction is marked by significant signalling of under or over arousal (over arousal is anxiety).

"An example in the classroom may be a young pupil with ADD in whom the gruff commands of a perhaps well-meaning but authoritarian teacher trigger anxiety. The child will become overaroused and will not “pay attention,” which raises the teacher’s ire."

It so often feels like everything to do with ADHD involves doing the exact opposite of what society deems logical.

“Marty would do much better if he would only learn to concentrate,” the teacher will write in his report card. Yet in another class with a teacher whose personality style he finds encouraging instead of intimidating, Marty does well."
This book is just my life at this point.😭

I just... school... it just ruined me. Once my second set of term exams was up (I did really well in the first) all my teachers changed, I was put in a new class with a new timetable. Most teachers hated me. A few liked me but I changed all my teachers twice in a single year.

Then every year after this it was "oh Rory eh, heard about you" then instantly vigilance triggered, chance of success nil.

When I was super sensitive to outside opinion of me, and also attuned to people's feelings (and bullied by peers), school just became impossible except if the teacher liked me - and treated me with respect. I started having more time off due to the fear, a downward spiral.

"He may have ADD, but his attention skills are not set according to some inflexible gauge. He is a “person in context.” The problem for him in this context is not attention as such, but his difficulty regulating his internal emotional environment.

It is all too easily discombobulated by the roughness his sensitive nervous system picks up in the teacher’s tone of voice."
I got so used to my name being used angrily. I always knew when I was disliked - this book seems to line up with my experience (this is just arousal)

This could also explain the utter exhaustion I feel from being over aroused when I know I am around really derogatory people who's views I don't agree with but can't challenge due to "social etiquette".

Most of my social withdrawal comes from being put in situations where I had to violate my own beliefs in order not to "make trouble" and to "be polite". I was always told to "respect my elders". "When you get older you'll understand". No guess what racism still sucks.

TW / abuse
I remember now why ADHD books that tackle tough origins and mediating factors are hard to read.. There's a section here on how children blame themselves for their abuse - "I was a difficult child", but we wouldn't say that if we saw it happen to someone else.

Understanding one of the reasons body doubling might work. We need emotional attachment to feel safe.

The book is Scattered Minds by Gabor Maté. It’s not for everyone some of it seems to be pure speculation with not many references.
