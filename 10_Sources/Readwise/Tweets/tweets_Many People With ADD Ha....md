> "Many people with ADD have noticed that a strange drowsiness may come over them in the midst of some emotionally charged situations, as, for example, during a conflict with a spouse. All of a sudden, they start yawning and their eyelids grow heavy.

> "An example in the classroom may be a young pupil with ADD in whom the gruff commands of a perhaps well-meaning but authoritarian teacher trigger anxiety. The child will become overaroused and will not “pay attention,” which raises the teacher’s ire."

> I just... school... it just ruined me. Once my second set of term exams was up (I did really well in the first) all my teachers changed, I was put in a new class with a new timetable. Most teachers hated me. A few liked me but I changed all my teachers twice in a single year.

> When I was super sensitive to outside opinion of me, and also attuned to people's feelings (and bullied by peers), school just became impossible except if the teacher liked me - and treated me with respect. I started having more time off due to the fear, a downward spiral.

> "He may have ADD, but his attention skills are not set according to some inflexible gauge. He is a “person in context.” The problem for him in this context is not attention as such, but his difficulty regulating his internal emotional environment.

> It is all too easily discombobulated by the roughness his sensitive nervous system picks up in the teacher’s tone of voice."
> I got so used to my name being used angrily. I always knew when I was disliked - this book seems to line up with my experience (this is just arousal)

> This could also explain the utter exhaustion I feel from being over aroused when I know I am around really derogatory people who's views I don't agree with but can't challenge due to "social etiquette".

> Most of my social withdrawal comes from being put in situations where I had to violate my own beliefs in order not to "make trouble" and to "be polite". I was always told to "respect my elders". "When you get older you'll understand". No guess what racism still sucks.

> TW / abuse
> I remember now why ADHD books that tackle tough origins and mediating factors are hard to read.. There's a section here on how children [[blame]] themselves for their abuse - "I was a difficult child", but we wouldn't say that if we saw it happen to someone else.
