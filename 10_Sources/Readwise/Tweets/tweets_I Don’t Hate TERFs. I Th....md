> I don’t hate TERFs. I think for the most part they are lonely, scared people, often traumatized, and they are trying to alleviate their pain by lashing out at a safe target, which is something hurt people often do. But that doesn’t mean that I accept or excuse their behavior.

> I can have compassion for most anyone. The vast majority of people are simply doing their best with the knowledge and tools they possess. Even those who do gleeful harm. It is possible to sympathize and even forgive while still setting strong boundaries around them.

> For me, keeping this view of people to the fore improves my view of the world. Instead of seeing people as assholes I try to see them as hurt people lacking knowledge and self-awareness. I get that because I am also that. But I don’t let my empathy blind me to the harm they do.
