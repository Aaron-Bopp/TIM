If your kid looks guilty or shameful after doing something bad. That is actually using the same brain receptors that physical pain show up in. Punishing them on top of it excessively is counter intuitive. If you insist, negotiate the punishment. Also tell them you love them.

A hypothesis for my life is that I actually listen to people far more than they realise and have internalised a lot of instructions I was given on a core level. I think scarily when autonomy was removed I outsourced control. I also got it back. A thread üßµ

If you struggle to work out if you are hot or cold sometimes, need to go to the bathroom, what emotions you are feeling, when you need to eat or drink. These are all related to interoception. This guide has been recommended.

The double empathy problem is a failure of logical capacity in emotional reasoning btw.

Individually, sometimes no (especially for those without).
Systemically, always - but it does depend on the larger international system.
The scarcity myth is one of Capitalism's greatest tools for keeping people in terrible conditions. https://t.co/JerHERKPfF

Just finishing up ‚ÄòMindsight‚Äô by Daniel Siegel. I know why it has been so hard to find my core. Feels like trying to construct a self when you are T-1000 in lava.

My brain constantly impulsive solves problems when I‚Äôm doing other things. 
‚ÄúIntrusive solutions‚Äù are one of my most common features.

The higher my stress in a social situation = the worse my recall
The lower my stress alone = weird as hell super creative and usually correct answers I haven‚Äôt been thinking about.

I think the second I stop stressing my brain often releases solutions to me. This explains why I solve a lot of problems in the shower or just as I am going to sleep. It‚Äôs a very frustrating thing.

@mykola You can get it back with proper fostering of intrinsic motivation, but yeah I had this same thing too. If you disarm the fear and shame responses, you need to do it in tandem with building up self-belief. This is why I think coaching helps for a lot of people.
