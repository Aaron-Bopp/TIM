it’s startling sometimes what people will reveal without intending to. here’s an example of a person who was traumatised, and partially knows it (“severely isolated”), but hasn’t yet connected the dots and faced the full pain and horror of it

it reminds me of something similar I once encountered a couple of years ago that sent shivers down my back: a woman arguing desperately that she knew what she was getting into with her rapist, that she was in control, not like all those other stupid girls who didn’t know better

it’s so easy to find ways to mock or insult people like this, especially when their broken methods of dealing with their trauma involves them shitting on other innocent people
but when you really see what’s going on it’s so sad. mockery doesn’t help at all

thinking now also about older folks who need to insist that they were unharmed by their own parents’ beatings and abuse, and snap about how soft kids these days are, etc… there’s a similarity in the patterns

people who were punished for crying seem to get *especially* uneasy when they see other people crying. they can’t just scroll past. they have to get involved to remind themselves how strong and brave they were for not crying
