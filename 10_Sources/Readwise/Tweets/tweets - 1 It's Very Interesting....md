1/ It's very interesting and useful I think to apply the MVP model of product development to personal development.

2/ I spent maybe a decade, maybe more of my time trying to improve myself by accumulating information, which is the base of the pyramid

3/ A: It's tiring, endless& ungratifying. Applies to all sorts of habit building. I focused wrongly on the bottom layer.

4/ What you want is get to the peak as fast as possible. Energy/willpower is a VERY limited resource early on. Hit the peak, unlock energy

5/ what is the peak? In writing, it's shipping/publishing sth and getting feedback from others, changing your identity / self-perception

6/ In cooking, it's making a dish, eating it, smiling and realizing that you liked it. You want to get to that point ASAFP.

7/ In fitness, it's breaking a sweat, getting an elevated heart rate, going home and showering and feeling the endorphins. CRITICAL.

8/ Counter-intuitively, this means you should do the minimum research possible. Because more research = inertia, time-cost, expectations

9/ I don't mean "go unprepared/uninformed". I mean that going for a walk is 100x more helpful than researching nuances of biomechanics

10/ The critical lever might be identity/belief. What's the smallest/fastest thing you can do to change your identity? That's real leverage.

11/ For me personally, "I'm a picky eater / don't know how to cook / have food issues" was a big part of my identity. Today I cooked eggs.
