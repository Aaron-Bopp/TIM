It seems to me that it is a manifestation of hyperfocus. We expend a lot of time and energy on honing our focus on something and struggle to change focus to something else as a result. E is for Erin drew this 7 years ago and it's a great illustration : /6

This is where it ties up with executive dysfunction, ADHD and even dyspraxia. A perfect storm develops of not knowing what needs to be done next, not being able to do it anyway, and then forgetting it ever needed to be done. This is a pretty disastrous combination. /10

Autistic inertia is the name we give to the peculiar phenomenon of autistic people (on the whole - as with all else, this is not entirely universal) struggling to change task, direction, focus. Even when we want to. /2
