people might have to hear you repeat yourself a dozen times in different ways over 5 years before they get what you‚Äôre saying, and this has nothing to do with you

People who inherit their models from some in-group are especially subsceptible to this. In-groups often have sacred truths that cannot be questioned - violate this and you get excommunicated. It‚Äôs actually quite rational for people to prioritise group loyalty over model accuracy

Anyway so let‚Äôs review
1. I have a very feral knowledge graph that goes wide and deep
2. I get singled out a lot, so I‚Äôm forced to learn to be comfortable with everybody‚Äôs eyes on me
When people talk about being afraid of public scrutiny, I can‚Äôt relate. I was raised in it

Is [[community]] gated behind social ability for certain people?  

###### ^252025209q

Which is why I put in so much effort into making friends, into being kind, into building a rigorous social graph of people who care about me. To me it‚Äôs abt survival. I don‚Äôt have a social safety net. Have you read history? People get displaced and cast out, just like that https://t.co/GwpfnTFHjC

4. Social reality is a Game Of Signals. I grew up very averse to this game, but have learned that there‚Äôs no way to opt-out, so we might as well get good at it. Everything we do or say (or not-do or not-say) is a signal https://t.co/p5zp6oOJHd

@shiraeis Emerson called it almost 200 years ago
too many people are living their lives with dead eyes, as an ordeal, an obligation
what the world "needs" is people who have come alive, who are joyful, who love living
everything else is downstream of that

whatcha think about this: "there are two primary ways to facilitate a change of heart: tears, and laughter. these deep, rumbling vibrations create cracks in the fortified walls that confine the heart. Cracks, that, as Leonard Cohen put it, allow the light to get in."
