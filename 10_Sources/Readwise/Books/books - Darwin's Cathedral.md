###### ^287471877q

Organisms are a product of natural selection. Through countless generations of variation and selection, they acquire properties that enable them to survive and reproduce in their environments. My purpose is to see if human groups in general, and religious groups in particular, qualify as organismic in this sense.

The author starts his argument with an acknowledgement of the difficulty of the question, his own biases, and then a definition of his terms. I think this an effective way to approach an issue in a way that both sides cam read on  

###### ^287471878q

I regard human evolution as a rapid and ongoing process, made possible by mechanisms loosely described as cultural, which means that human nature will never be set in stone, for better or for worse.

Fifty-one billion is how many tons of greenhouse gases the world typically adds to the atmosphere every year. Although the figure may go up or down a bit from year to year, it’s generally increasing. This is where we are today.

This the core inquiry of this book, and does not exclude primarily religious or primarily scientific thinkers. Religious people can aproach it from the view point of the affects of sin and their fight against sin, while scientific people can view from the point of natural selection and reciprocal altruism. Both of these viewpoints deal heavily with human interaction, the social order, and social progress.  

###### ^292550146q

What is the nature of human society? Is it a collection of self-seeking individuals, or can it be regarded as an organism in its own right? These questions have been pondered by inquiring minds throughout the ages, with no more agreement today than 500 or 2,000 years ago.

One reason that I admire some aspects of religion is because I share some of its values. I have not attempted to hide this fact, and I hope that it has not intruded upon my science. Nor have I attempted to conceal my own basic optimism that the world can be a better place in the future than in the past or present—that there can be such a thing as a path to enlightenment. Being a scientist does not require becoming indifferent to human welfare.

There can be no doubt that a tribe including many members who, from possessing in a high degree the spirit of patriotism, fidelity, obedience, courage, and sympathy, were always ready to aid one another, and to sacrifice themselves for the common good would be victorious over most other tribes; and this would be natural selection. —Darwin 1871, 166

The term “for the good of the group” was used as freely as “for the good of the individual.” Then, starting in the 1960s, adaptation at the level of groups was rejected so strongly that the ensuing period could be called the age of individualism in evolutionary biology.

A well-organized attacking army seems more like a single predator than a passing boulder, but the class of beggars has no organ-like function in society, although it may be explained by functionalist thinking at a lower level, such as individual greed resulting in an unequal division of resources. Thus, social groups are a nebulous and heterogeneous category with respect to the concept of adaptation.

Darwin’s theory is so simple that it can be explained in a single paragraph, but its implications are so profound that the study of life was transformed, enabling the great geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky (1973) to say: “Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.”

###### ^288878740q

When we compare the fitness of callers and noncallers within each group, we see that callers are the losers in both cases. However, the group with more callers fares better than the group with fewer callers. This is the classic group selection scenario that began with Darwin.

What are the three steps to apply group selection?
1. Identify the relevant groups
2. Compare fitness of individuals within groups
3. Compare fitness of groups in the total population
By combining these we can see what evolves.  

###### ^305945983q

One noncaller has a survival probability of 100 percent and nine have a survival probability of 50 percent for an average of 55 percent. One caller has a survival probability of 25 percent and nine have a survival probability of 75 percent for an average of 70 percent. ... Employing this procedure for our bird flock example, the groups are flocks, callers are less fit than noncallers within flocks, but flocks with more callers are more fit than flocks with fewer callers. When the variation among groups is as extreme as in my example (one caller in the first group and nine callers in the second group) group selection is by far the strongest evolutionary force and the calling behavior evolves despite its selective disadvantage within groups.

it has become increasingly certain that evolution also takes place along a different pathway: by social groups becoming so functionally integrated that they become higher-level organisms in their own right. One of the first to propose this radical new theory was Lynn Margulis (1970), who claimed that eukaryotic cells—the nucleated cells of all organisms other than bacteria—are actually symbiotic communities of bacteria whose members led a more autonomous existence in the distant past. Now it appears likely that similar transitions, from groups of organisms to groups as organisms, have occurred throughout the history of life, right down to the origin of life itself as social groups of cooperating molecular reactions

Returning to the “selfish gene” that replicates rather than contributing to the common good of the cell, this problem can be solved by linking all the genes together into a chromosome that replicates as a unit.

Victor Turner ([1969] 1995) analyzed religious ritual in terms of two key concepts: communitas and structure. Structure is the system of roles related to age, sex, and status that people in a community occupy. Communitas is a conception of the community as an egalitarian unit in which all members, from highest to lowest, have a moral claim. The purpose of structure is to implement the spirit of communitas.

The question “Why do these particular fruit flies have this particular phenotype?” has two answers. First, every phenotype is caused mechanistically by genes that interact with each other and their environment during development. Second, the phenotype exists because of a history of selection for that phenotype, coupled with heritable variation. These two explanations are usually labeled “proximate” and “ultimate” respectively, and there is a sense in which the latter is more fundamental than the former.

Today there are more than two dozen types of plastics, and they range from the kind of thing you might expect—the polypropylene in yogurt containers, for example—to more surprising uses like the acrylic in paint, floor polish, and laundry detergent, or the microplastics in soap and shampoo, or the nylon in your waterproof jacket, or the polyester in all those regrettable clothes I wore in the 1970s. All these different types of plastics have one thing in common: They contain carbon. Carbon, it turns out, is useful in creating all sorts of different materials because it bonds easily with a wide variety of different elements; in the case of plastics, it’s usually clustered with hydrogen and oxygen.

One approach is to take recycled carbon dioxide—possibly captured during the process of making cement—and inject it back into the cement before it’s used at the construction site. The company that’s pursuing this idea has several dozen customers already, including Microsoft and McDonald’s; so far it’s only able to reduce emissions by around 10 percent, though it hopes to get to 33 percent eventually. Another, more theoretical approach involves making cement out of seawater and the carbon dioxide captured from power plants. The inventors behind this idea think it could ultimately cut emissions by more than 70 percent.

Major elements of the God-person relationship in Calvin’s catechism are listed in table 3.2. God is portrayed as an all-powerful being who created man in his own image. Instead of worshiping God with fitting gratitude, man arrogantly placed himself above God and had to be deprived of all glory to recognize its true source. All people share this original sin and are born thoroughly depraved. By themselves they have no free will to choose between good and evil; they are bent on evil. Their only path to redemption is to become convinced of their corrupt nature and the certain horrible fate that awaits them if they do not earnestly seek God. Then, however, they have opened “the first door into his Kingdom” by overthrowing “the two most harmful plagues of all, carefree disregard of his vengeance and false confidence in our own capacity.”

Calvin attempted to implement a high degree of social control in Geneva. Families were visited once a year to have their spiritual health examined. Church attendance was required, and playing a game of skittles on Easter Sunday was sufficient to send the son of a prominent family to prison.

We have seen that Calvinism fostered a degree of mutual criticism, differences of opinion, and the internal checks and balances that are required for a group to make intelligent decisions and to prevent subversion from within. However, dissension from outside the church elicited another kind of reaction altogether. A menacing placard placed in the pulpit of St. Peter’s cathedral led to the arrest of one Jacques Gruet, a friend of the powerful Favre family. Gruet confessed under torture, and a search of his house revealed more incriminating evidence.

Gruet, says Roget, was a free thinker and a liberal in the modern sense. He distinguished between offences against God, with which the magistrate need not concern himself, and offences against society, which ought to be repressed. As Choisy has pointed out, Calvin could not understand the distinction.

Calvin evidently believed to the depth of his soul that Christ’s return to earth was imminent, requiring urgent preparation on the part of the church. Similar beliefs in imminent events have arisen repeatedly in religions around the world and have a clear latent function (motivating action) that differs from their manifest function. ... The beliefs that motivate religious people to behave as they do in their own minds (the manifest functions) often depart from the adaptive consequences that ultimately sustain the beliefs (the latent functions).

people who stand outside of religion often regard its seemingly irrational nature as more interesting and important to explain than its communal nature. Rational thought is treated as the gold standard against which religious belief is found so wanting that it becomes well-nigh inexplicable. Evolution causes us to think about the subject in a completely different way. Adaptation becomes the gold standard against which rational thought must be measured alongside other modes of thought. In a single stroke, rational thought becomes necessary but not sufficient to explain the length and breadth of human mentality, and the so-called irrational features of religion can be studied respectfully as potential adaptations in their own right rather than as idiot relatives of rational thought.

At the summit of a volcano on the island of Bali stands an immense temple for the worship of Dewi Danu, goddess of the waters that are thought to emanate from the volcano’s crater lake. The temple is inhabited by twenty-four priests, chosen as children by a virgin priestess to be lifelong servants of the goddess. The high priest is called the Jero Gde and is thought to be an earthly representative of the goddess herself. The Jero Gde is always dressed in white and wears his hair long. By day he offers sacrifices on behalf of the farmers who rely on water to irrigate their rice crops. By night he receives guidance from the goddess in his dreams. ... The rain that falls on the mountain tumbles down to the sea in rivers that cut deeply into the soft volcanic rock. To use the water for irrigation, the Balinese have created a vast system of aqueducts, often running through tunnels a kilometer or more in length, that shunt the water from the rivers to the rice terraces, also sculpted by human labor from the steep mountain slopes. Below the grand temple of the crater lake stand smaller temples at every branch of the irrigation system, ending with the smallest temples where the channels empty onto the fields. ... In addition to the water temples there are other temples, large and small; in houses, market places, villages, palaces, throughout the island of Bali, whose deities are drawn from the original indigenous religion and from the more recent religions that arrived by trade, migration, and invasion.

the Jero Gde resolved a dispute between a downstream Subak that destroyed the dam of an upstream subak to increase their share of water. Another example involved a village that wanted to start a new subak by building a channel from a newly discovered spring (80–81). The temple priests inspected the spring before granting permission to see if the project was feasible and if it would reduce water flow to the existing subaks. They then provided practical advice for the construction of the new irrigation system and fields.

Our big brains might allow us to play the social game better than other creatures, but we are playing the same game.

I find it highly plausible that we are endowed with an innate psychology that is crudely approximated by the adaptive rules of the evolutionary models ... We have an innate capacity for altruism, selfishness, retaliation, forgiveness, contrition, generosity, commitment, saintliness, and vengefulness.2 More, we are endowed with a set of if-then rules for when to employ these traits.

Forgiveness is often valued and retaliation devalued in everyday thought, especially Christian thought. For the moment, we need to suspend these value judgments. In the context of evolutionary models, retaliation is absolutely essential to keep the wolves of selfishness at bay. To retaliate can be divine.

A behavior is selfish when it increases the fitness of the actor, relative to other members of its group. A behavior is altruistic when it increases the fitness of the group, relative to other groups, and decreases the relative fitness of the actor within the group.

[[Evolutionary Psychology]]  

###### ^292550153q

The term “evolutionary psychology” should refer broadly to the study of psychology from an evolutionary perspective. Unfortunately, the term has become associated with a rather narrow school of thought that is controversial even among evolutionary biologists interested in psychology.

complexity can have profound effects on variation and heritability, the two prerequisites for natural selection. ... See Wilson (1992), Swenson, Arendt, and Wilson (2000), and Swenson, Wilson, and Elias (2000) for fuller discussions of the issues in the context of selection at the level of biological communities and ecosystems.

Idealized religion is close to what one expects on the basis of pure group selection, or so I claim. Religion as practiced often deviates from the ideal, but these deviations tend to be regarded as “corruptions” rather than as a part of the religion itself. It is useful to retain this distinction ... The idealized form was designed to establish an organismic community, and the realized form partially succeeded.

I feel the only explanation is that the highly functional system of today is survivor of many less functional systems of the past. In the past non religous groups of farmers where outcompeted by religious groups untilt he the religious system over took the whole mountain. Judt as the religous system dealt with pests it could have dealt with other groups that ran against its interests and eventually out survive them

The process of selection that gave rise to the water temple system of Bali is currently less well understood than the functionality of the system itself.

Based on immigration alone, Judaism is at a large disadvantage compared to proselytizing Christian and Islamic religions, which accounts in part for its minority status. Despite its disadvantage with respect to immigration, however, Judaism has persisted on the strength of the other factors that contribute to demographic growth (high birth rate, low death rate, and low emigration).
