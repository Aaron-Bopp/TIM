anesthesia doesn’t just work on your brain, or on your mind. It works on your consciousness. By altering the delicate electrochemical balance within the neural circuitry inside your head, the basic ground state of what it is to “be” is—temporarily—abolished.

Why do we experience life in the first person?

###### ^308153754q

I can replace your brain with a machine that is its equal in every way, so that from the outside, nobody could tell the difference. This new machine has many advantages—it is immune to decay, and perhaps it will allow you to live forever. But there’s a catch. Since even future-me is not sure how real brains give rise to consciousness, I can’t guarantee that you will have any conscious experiences at all, ... since your machine-brain leads to identical behavior in every way, when I ask new-you whether you are conscious, new-you will say yes. But what if, despite this answer, life—for you—is no longer in the first person?

###### ^308153750q

you exist, but the notion that there is a single unique conscious self (a soul?) that persists over time may be grossly mistaken. Indeed, one of the most compelling aspects of the mystery of consciousness is the nature of self. Is consciousness possible without self-consciousness, and if so, would it still matter so much?

###### ^308153751q

a science of consciousness should explain how the various properties of consciousness depend on, and relate to, the operations of the neuronal wetware inside our heads.

I use the word “wetware” to underline that brains are not computers made of meat. They are chemical machines as much as they are electrical networks.

###### ^308153753q

The essence of selfhood is neither a rational mind nor an immaterial soul. It is a deeply embodied biological process, a process that underpins the simple feeling of being alive that is the basis for all our experiences of self, indeed for any conscious experience at all. Being you is literally about your body.

###### ^308344259q

our conscious experiences of the world and the self are forms of brain-based prediction—“controlled hallucinations”—that arise with, through, and because of our living bodies.
