The boy being God is a main theme of this book. The boy does not posses any godlike features except the most important one, the ability to fuel belief. Without the boy, the man would not be able to believe that there are people out there, that those people might be worth saving, and that there is a reason for their suffering.

> Then he just knelt in the ashes. He raised his face to the paling day. Are you there? he whispered. Will I see you at the last? Have you a neck by which to throttle you? Have you a heart? Damn you eternally have you a soul? Oh God, he whispered. Oh God.

> You promised not to do that, the boy said. What? You know what, Papa. He poured the hot water back into the pan and took the boy’s cup and poured some of the cocoa into his own and then handed it back. I have to watch you all the time, the boy said. I know. If you break little promises you’ll break big ones. That’s what you said. I know. But I wont.

> The one thing I can tell you is that you wont survive for yourself. I know because I would never have come this far. A person who had no one would be well advised to cobble together some passable ghost. Breathe it into being and coax it along with words of love. Offer it each phantom crumb and shield it from harm with your body. As for me my only hope is for eternal nothingness and I hope it with all my heart.

> The hundred nights they’d sat up debating the pros and cons of self destruction with the earnestness of philosophers chained to a madhouse wall. In the morning the boy said nothing at all and when they were packed and ready to set out upon the road he turned and looked back at their campsite and he said: She’s gone isn’t she? And he said: Yes, she is.

The man isn't refering to the boy as god, but the author does write it in such a way that it almost sees that way

> God, he whispered. He reached and shook the boy, keeping his eyes on the road.
