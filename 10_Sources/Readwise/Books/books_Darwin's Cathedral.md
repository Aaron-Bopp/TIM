###### ^287471877q

Organisms are a product of natural selection. Through countless generations of variation and selection, they acquire properties that enable them to survive and reproduce in their environments. My purpose is to see if human groups in general, and religious groups in particular, qualify as organismic in this sense.

The author starts his argument with an acknowledgement of the difficulty of the question, his own biases, and then a definition of his terms. I think this an effective way to approach an issue in a way that both sides cam read on  

###### ^287471878q

I regard human evolution as a rapid and ongoing process, made possible by mechanisms loosely described as cultural, which means that human nature will never be set in stone, for better or for worse.

This the core inquiry of this book, and does not exclude primarily religious or primarily scientific thinkers. Religious people can aproach it from the view point of the affects of sin and their fight against sin, while scientific people can view from the point of natural selection and reciprocal altruism. Both of these viewpoints deal heavily with human interaction, the social order, and social progress.  

###### ^292550146q

What is the nature of human society? Is it a collection of self-seeking individuals, or can it be regarded as an organism in its own right? These questions have been pondered by inquiring minds throughout the ages, with no more agreement today than 500 or 2,000 years ago.

One reason that I admire some aspects of religion is because I share some of its values. I have not attempted to hide this fact, and I hope that it has not intruded upon my science. Nor have I attempted to conceal my own basic optimism that the world can be a better place in the future than in the past or present—that there can be such a thing as a path to enlightenment. Being a scientist does not require becoming indifferent to human welfare.

There can be no doubt that a tribe including many members who, from possessing in a high degree the spirit of patriotism, fidelity, obedience, courage, and sympathy, were always ready to aid one another, and to sacrifice themselves for the common good would be victorious over most other tribes; and this would be natural selection. —Darwin 1871, 166

The term “for the good of the group” was used as freely as “for the good of the individual.” Then, starting in the 1960s, adaptation at the level of groups was rejected so strongly that the ensuing period could be called the age of individualism in evolutionary biology.

Functionalist and nonfunctionalist ways of thought are so different from each other, and so useful in some contexts but misleading in others, that they may actually have evolved as separate cognitive skills (Hauser and Carey 1998; Tomasello 1999).

A well-organized attacking army seems more like a single predator than a passing boulder, but the class of beggars has no organ-like function in society, although it may be explained by functionalist thinking at a lower level, such as individual greed resulting in an unequal division of resources. Thus, social groups are a nebulous and heterogeneous category with respect to the concept of adaptation.

###### ^292550149q

Darwin’s theory is so simple that it can be explained in a single paragraph, but its implications are so profound that the study of life was transformed, enabling the great geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky (1973) to say: “Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.”

###### ^288936970q

it has become increasingly certain that evolution also takes place along a different pathway: by social groups becoming so functionally integrated that they become higher-level organisms in their own right. One of the first to propose this radical new theory was Lynn Margulis (1970), who claimed that eukaryotic cells—the nucleated cells of all organisms other than bacteria—are actually symbiotic communities of bacteria whose members led a more autonomous existence in the distant past. Now it appears likely that similar transitions, from groups of organisms to groups as organisms, have occurred throughout the history of life, right down to the origin of life itself as social groups of cooperating molecular reactions

He goes on to explain this via the difference between a genetic trait (mutation in a gene) to a cultural trait (belief or practice). I see the major frame shift as realizing that cultural traits are not only passed on via reproduction, but through communication. This is a major change I think, but does not mean the evolutionary model can't be applied

It is unfortunate that evolution is so often associated with genetic evolution, a slow process that gives the impression of an incapacity for change over the time scales that matter most to living people struggling with their problems. When we expand our view of evolution to include all Darwinian processes, we can begin to see how religions actually can produce transformative change, even from a purely evolutionary perspective.

Superficially, large-scale human societies appear much less egalitarian than hunter-gatherer groups, but the apparent inequities can be interpreted in two very different ways. On the one hand, social control mechanisms are probably strongest in small groups in which everyone knows and depends on everyone else. Many inequities that exist in large-scale societies are therefore exactly what they seem—some individuals profiting at the expense of others within the society. ... On the other hand, purely from the group-level functional standpoint, societies must become differentiated as they increase in size. ...

Second, the phenotype exists because of a history of selection for that phenotype, coupled with heritable variation.
