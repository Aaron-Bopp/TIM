### CHURCH AS ORGANISM



###### ^287471877q

> Organisms are a product of natural selection. Through countless generations of variation and selection, they acquire properties that enable them to survive and reproduce in their environments. My purpose is to see if human groups in general, and religious groups in particular, qualify as organismic in this sense.

##### ^287471878

The author starts his argument with an acknowledgement of the difficulty of the question, his own biases, and then a definition of his terms. I think this an effective way to approach an issue in a way that both sides cam read on  


###### ^287471878q

> I regard human evolution as a rapid and ongoing process, made possible by mechanisms loosely described as cultural, which means that human nature will never be set in stone, for better or for worse.

###### ^287471880q

> One reason that I admire some aspects of religion is because I share some of its values. I have not attempted to hide this fact, and I hope that it has not intruded upon my science. Nor have I attempted to conceal my own basic optimism that the world can be a better place in the future than in the past or present—that there can be such a thing as a path to enlightenment. Being a scientist does not require becoming indifferent to human welfare.

###### ^288296631q

> There can be no doubt that a tribe including many members who, from possessing in a high degree the spirit of patriotism, fidelity, obedience, courage, and sympathy, were always ready to aid one another, and to sacrifice themselves for the common good would be victorious over most other tribes; and this would be natural selection. —Darwin 1871, 166

###### ^288296632q

> The term “for the good of the group” was used as freely as “for the good of the individual.” Then, starting in the 1960s, adaptation at the level of groups was rejected so strongly that the ensuing period could be called the age of individualism in evolutionary biology. 
  [^288296632]

[^288296632]: https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00DQMWSUY&location=108




###### ^288296633q

> Religion returns to center stage, not as a theological explanation of purpose and order, but as itself a product of evolution that enables groups to function as adaptive units—at least to a degree.

#### ADAPTATION AND FUNCTIONALIST THINKING



###### ^288296634q

> Thinking about an object or an organism as if it has a purpose can be called functionalist thinking. Functionalist thinking can be highly effective when applied to things that actually have a purpose, but in other contexts it can be misleading.

###### ^288296637q

> A well-organized attacking army seems more like a single predator than a passing boulder, but the class of beggars has no organ-like function in society, although it may be explained by functionalist thinking at a lower level, such as individual greed resulting in an unequal division of resources. Thus, social groups are a nebulous and heterogeneous category with respect to the concept of adaptation.

#### DARWIN’S SOLUTION TO THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM



###### ^288633669q

> There can be a population of groups (many tribes of humans, many flocks of birds) that vary in their phenotypic properties (standard of morality, warning cries), with consequences for survival and reproduction (intertribal warfare, avoiding predators).

###### ^288633670q

> First, just because groups can evolve into adaptive units doesn’t mean that they do. The days of axiomatically thinking of groups as adaptive units are gone forever. Special conditions are required that may or may not be satisfied in the real world.

##### How to see group selection



###### ^288878740q

> When we compare the fitness of callers and noncallers within each group, we see that callers are the losers in both cases. However, the group with more callers fares better than the group with fewer callers. This is the classic group selection scenario that began with Darwin.

###### ^288936969q

> we do not want to return to the days when groups were axiomatically assumed to function as adaptive units. The point is to achieve a middle ground in which the importance of the various levels of natural selection are examined on a case-by-case basis, using a procedure that allows group selection to be seen where it exists.

#### MAJOR TRANSITIONS OF LIFE



###### ^288936970q

> it has become increasingly certain that evolution also takes place along a different pathway: by social groups becoming so functionally integrated that they become higher-level organisms in their own right. One of the first to propose this radical new theory was Lynn Margulis (1970), who claimed that eukaryotic cells—the nucleated cells of all organisms other than bacteria—are actually symbiotic communities of bacteria whose members led a more autonomous existence in the distant past. Now it appears likely that similar transitions, from groups of organisms to groups as organisms, have occurred throughout the history of life, right down to the origin of life itself as social groups of cooperating molecular reactions
