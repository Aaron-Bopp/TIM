###### ^301593485q

This is a central point of this book—we don’t hate violence. We hate and fear the wrong kind of violence, violence in the wrong context. Because violence in the right context is different.

you can’t begin to understand things like aggression, competition, cooperation, and empathy without biology; ... you’re just as much up the creek if you rely only on biology; ... it actually makes no sense to distinguish between aspects of a behavior that are “biological” and those that would be described as, say, “psychological” or “cultural.”

the visual spectrum is a continuum of wavelengths from violet to red, and it is arbitrary where boundaries are put for different color names ... If the color-name boundary in that person’s language happens to fall between the two colors, the person will overestimate the difference between the two. If the colors fall in the same category, the opposite happens.

when you think categorically, you have trouble seeing how similar or different two things are. If you pay lots of attention to where boundaries are, you pay less attention to complete pictures.

###### ^301731326q

In the mid-1960s, a rightist military coup overthrew the government of Indonesia, instituting the thirty-year dictatorship of Suharto known as the New Order. Following the coup, government-sponsored purges of communists, leftists, intellectuals, unionists, and ethnic Chinese left about a half million dead.9 Mass executions, torture, villages torched with inhabitants trapped inside. ... they would, incongruously, bring along a traditional gamelan orchestra. ... Why? Why would you possibly do that? The man looked puzzled and gave what seemed to him a self-evident answer: “Well, to make it more beautiful.”

Is “aggression” about thought, emotion, or something done with muscles? Is “altruism” something that can be studied mathematically in various species, including bacteria, or are we discussing moral development in kids?

Macleans Triune Model  

###### ^301731328q

Layer 1: An ancient part of the brain, at its base, found in species from humans to geckos. This layer mediates automatic, regulatory functions. If body temperature drops, this brain region senses it and commands muscles to shiver. ... Layer 2: A more recently evolved region that has expanded in mammals. MacLean conceptualized this layer as being about emotions, ... Layer 3: The recently evolved layer of neocortex sitting on the upper surface of the brain. Proportionately, primates devote more of their brain to this layer than do other species. Cognition, memory storage, sensory processing, abstractions, philosophy, navel contemplation. Read a scary passage of a book, and layer 3 signals layer 2 to make you feel frightened, prompting layer 1 to initiate shivering.

Caveats of the triune model  

###### ^301731329q

Anatomically there is considerable overlap among the three layers ... The flow of information and commands is not just top down, from layer 3 to 2 to 1. ... Automatic aspects of behavior (simplistically, the purview of layer 1), emotion (layer 2), and thought (layer 3) are not separable. The triune model leads one, erroneously, to think that evolution in effect slapped on each new layer without any changes occurring in the one(s) already there.

for a rat, emotion and olfaction are nearly synonymous, since nearly all the environmental stimuli that elicit emotions in a rodent are olfactory. Peace in our time. In a rodent, olfactory inputs are what the limbic system most depends on for emotional news of the world.

The limbic system’s regions form complex circuits of excitation and inhibition. It’s easier to understand this by appreciating the deeply held desire of every limbic structure—to influence what the hypothalamus does.

All of this is automatic, or “autonomic.” And thus the midbrain and brain-stem regions, along with their projections down the spine and out to the body, are collectively termed the “autonomic nervous system.”*

The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) mediates the body’s response to arousing circumstances, for example, producing the famed “fight or flight” stress response.

###### ^301731160q

the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) arises from different midbrain/brain-stem nuclei that project down the spine to the body. In contrast to the SNS and the four Fs, the PNS is about calm, vegetative states. The SNS speeds up the heart; the PNS slows it down. The PNS promotes digestion; the SNS inhibits it (which makes sense—if you’re running for your life, avoiding being someone’s lunch, don’t waste energy digesting breakfast).

###### ^301731161q

So the limbic system indirectly regulates autonomic function and hormone release. What does this have to do with behavior? Plenty—because the autonomic and hormonal states of the body feed back to the brain, influencing behavior (typically unconsciously).*

The cortex and limbic system are not separate, as scads of axonal projections course between the two. Crucially, those projections are bidirectional—the limbic system talks to the cortex, rather than merely being reined in by it.

cortex is not a smooth surface but instead is folded into convolutions. The convolutions form a superstructure of four separate lobes: the temporal, parietal, occipital, and frontal, each with different functions.

if you asked amygdala experts what behavior their favorite brain structure brings to mind, “aggression” wouldn’t top their list. It would be fear and anxiety.9 Crucially, the brain region most involved in feeling afraid and anxious is most involved in generating aggression.

the hypothalamus consists of a bunch of different nuclei, each receiving a unique orchestration of limbic inputs and equivalently distinctive outputs to various midbrain/brain-stem regions. And while each hypothalamic nucleus has a different set of functions, they all fall under the general rubric of autonomic regulation.

In one study subjects in a brain scanner played a Ms. Pac-Man–from–hell video game where they were pursued in a maze by a dot; if caught, they’d be shocked.11 When people were evading the dot, the amygdala was silent. However, its activity increased as the dot approached; the stronger the shocks, the farther away the dot would be when first activating the amygdala, the stronger the activation, and the larger the self-reported feeling of panic.

The core of innate fear (aka a phobia) is that you don’t have to learn by trial and error that something is aversive. For example, a rat born in a lab, who has interacted only with other rats and grad students, instinctually fears and avoids the smell of cats.

The evolutionarily ancient central amygdala plays a key role in innate fears. Surrounding it is the basolateral amygdala (BLA), which is more recently evolved and somewhat resembles the fancy, modern cortex. It’s the BLA that learns fear and then sends the news to the central amygdala.
