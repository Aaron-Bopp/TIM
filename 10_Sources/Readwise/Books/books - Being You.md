anesthesia doesn’t just work on your brain, or on your mind. It works on your consciousness. By altering the delicate electrochemical balance within the neural circuitry inside your head, the basic ground state of what it is to “be” is—temporarily—abolished.

###### ^308153754q

I can replace your brain with a machine that is its equal in every way, so that from the outside, nobody could tell the difference. This new machine has many advantages—it is immune to decay, and perhaps it will allow you to live forever. But there’s a catch. Since even future-me is not sure how real brains give rise to consciousness, I can’t guarantee that you will have any conscious experiences at all, ... since your machine-brain leads to identical behavior in every way, when I ask new-you whether you are conscious, new-you will say yes. But what if, despite this answer, life—for you—is no longer in the first person?

you exist, but the notion that there is a single unique conscious self (a soul?) that persists over time may be grossly mistaken. Indeed, one of the most compelling aspects of the mystery of consciousness is the nature of self. Is consciousness possible without self-consciousness, and if so, would it still matter so much?

At various times in the past, being conscious has been confused with having language, being intelligent, or exhibiting behavior of a particular kind. But consciousness does not depend on outward behavior, as is clear during dreaming and for people suffering states of total bodily paralysis.

“global workspace” ... mental content (perceptions, thoughts, emotions, and so on) becomes conscious when it gains access to a “workspace,” which—anatomically speaking—is distributed across the frontal and parietal regions of the cortex. ... When mental content is broadcast within this cortical workspace, we are conscious of it, and it can be used to guide behavior in much more flexible ways than is the case for unconscious perception.

“higher-order thought” theory, proposes that mental content becomes conscious when there is a “higher-level” cognitive process that is somehow oriented toward it, rendering it conscious. In this theory, consciousness is closely tied to processes like metacognition—meaning “cognition about cognition”—which again emphasizes functional properties over phenomenology

How do conscious experiences relate to the biophysical machinery inside our brains and our bodies? ... The classic formulation of this question is known as the “hard problem” of consciousness. This expression was coined by the Australian philosopher David Chalmers in the early 1990s ... “[E]ven when we have explained the performance of all the functions in the vicinity of experience—perceptual discrimination, categorization, internal access, verbal report—there may still remain a further unanswered question: Why is the performance of these functions accompanied by experience?”

Functionalism is the idea that consciousness does not depend on what a system is made of (its physical constitution), but only on what the system does, on the functions it performs, on how it transforms inputs into outputs. The intuition driving functionalism is that mind and consciousness are forms of information processing which can be implemented by brains, but for which biological brains are not strictly necessary.

A philosophical zombie is a creature that is indistinguishable from a conscious creature, but which lacks consciousness. A zombie Anil Seth would look like me, act like me, walk like me, and talk like me, but there would be nothing it is like to be it, no inner universe, no felt experience. Ask zombie Anil if he is conscious, and he will say, “Yes, I’m conscious.” Zombie Anil would even have written various essays on the neuroscience of consciousness, including some thoughts about the questionable relevance of philosophical zombies to this topic.

In binocular rivalry, a different image is shown to each eye—perhaps a picture of a face to the left eye and a picture of a house to the right eye. In this situation, conscious perception doesn’t settle on a weird face-house chimera. It flips back and forth between the face and the house, dwelling for a few seconds on each. ... conscious perception changes even though the sensory input remains constant. By looking at what happens in the brain, it’s therefore possible to distinguish brain activity that tracks conscious perception from activity that tracks whatever the sensory input happens to be. The brain activity that goes along with the conscious perception identifies the NCC for that perception.

Interesting that we let medical equipment liek this be onfuscated by patents  

###### ^314793665q

brain-based consciousness monitors have been deployed in operating theaters for many years already. The most common is the “bispectral index” monitor. While the details lie hidden beneath patents, the basic concept is to combine a range of electroencephalographic (EEG) measures together into a single continuously updated number, to guide the anesthesiologist during surgery. This is a fine idea, but bispectral index monitors have remained controversial, partly because there have been several instances where their readings have been inconsistent with other behavioral signs of consciousness, such as patients opening their eyes or remembering what the surgeons had been saying during an operation. A deeper problem, when it comes to consciousness science, is that the bispectral index is not based on any principled theory.

Even though we do not directly feel the TMS pulses, Massimini and Tononi found that their electrical echoes could be used to distinguish different levels of consciousness. In unconscious states, like dreamless sleep and general anesthesia, these echoes are very simple. There is a strong initial response in the part of the brain that was zapped, but this response dies away quickly, like the ripples caused by throwing a stone into still water. But during conscious states, the response is very different: a typical echo ranges widely over the cortical surface, disappearing and reappearing in complex patterns.

These departures from “normal” conscious experience are so pervasive that the psychedelic state might represent not only a change in conscious contents, but also a change in overall conscious level.

the classic psychedelics—LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, and dimethyltryptamine (DMT, the active ingredient in the South American hallucinogenic brew called ayahuasca)—work primarily by affecting the brain’s serotonin system.

Psychedelic drugs influence the serotonin system by binding strongly to a specific serotonin receptor, the 5-HT2A receptor, which is found throughout much of the brain.

psychedelic state involves striking alterations in brain dynamics, when compared to a placebo control condition. Networks of brain regions that are usually coordinated in their activity—so-called “resting-state networks”—become uncoupled, and other regions that are usually more or less independent become linked.

Michael Schartner and Adam Barrett calculated the changes in the algorithmic complexity of the MEG signal across many different regions in the brain for all three psychedelic states. The results were clear and surprising: psilocybin, LSD, and ketamine all led to increases when compared to a placebo control.

A brain with all its neurons firing willy-nilly would seem more likely to give rise to no conscious experience at all, just as free-form jazz at some point stops being music.

Conscious experiences are informative because every conscious experience is different from every other conscious experience ... At any one time, we have precisely one conscious experience out of vastly many possible conscious experiences. Every conscious experience therefore delivers a massive reduction of uncertainty, since this experience is being had, and not that experience, or that experience, and so on. And reduction of uncertainty is—mathematically—what is meant by “information.”

Each hemisphere of the cerebral cortex has four lobes. The frontal lobes are at the front. The parietal lobes are toward the back and off to the sides. The occipital lobes are at the back, and the temporal lobes are at the sides, near the ears. Some people identify a fifth lobe—the limbic lobe—deep inside the brain.

Functional MRI (fMRI) measures a metabolic signal (blood oxygenation) related to neural activity—it offers high spatial detail but is only indirectly related to what neurons do. EEG measures the tiny electrical signals generated by the activity of large populations of neurons near the cortical surface. This method tracks brain activity more directly than fMRI, but with lower spatial specificity.

Imagining (and executing) fluent movements activates cortical regions such as the supplementary motor area, while imagining spatial navigation lights up other regions, such as the parahippocampal gyrus. Anatomically, these brain areas are quite distant from each other. Unsurprisingly, both imagery tasks activate regions involved in hearing and in language processing.

Reflective insight is preserved in the rare “lucid dreaming” state, in which dreamers are aware that they are dreaming and can voluntarily direct their behavior. In a remarkable recent study, researchers were able to communicate with people during lucid dreams by using their eye movements as a channel, much like the locked-in patients described earlier. These dreamers were able to correctly answer simple math problems, as well as various yes/no questions.

In this view, the “what-it-is-like-ness” of any specific conscious experience is defined not so much by what it is, but by all the unrealized but possible things that it is not. An experience of pure redness is the way that it is, not because of any intrinsic property of “redness,” but because red is not blue, green, or any other color, or any smell, or a thought or a feeling of regret or indeed any other form of mental content whatsoever.

In a maximally information-rich brain, all neurons would behave independently, firing randomly as if they were completely disconnected. In such a brain, measures of algorithmic complexity, like LZW complexity, would score very high. But this brain—with lots of information but no integration—would not support any conscious states. At the other extreme, a maximally ordered brain would have all neurons doing exactly the same thing, perhaps firing in lockstep together, somewhat like what happens during global epileptic seizures. Algorithmic complexity here would be very low. This brain would also lack consciousness, but for a different reason: lots of integration, no information.

In IIT, Φ measures the amount of information a system generates “as a whole,” over and above the amount of information generated by its parts independently. This underpins the main claim of the theory, which is that a system is conscious to the extent that its whole generates more information than its parts. ... the level of Φ is intrinsic to a system (meaning that it does not depend on an external observer), and it is identical to the amount of consciousness associated with that system. High Φ, lots of consciousness. Zero Φ, no consciousness.
