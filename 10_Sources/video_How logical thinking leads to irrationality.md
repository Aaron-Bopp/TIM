#### Notes

- people assume if they are highly rational they are non-emotional
- emotionality != irattionality and rationality === emotionality
	- [[Reciprocal inhibition]]
- skill in argument does not mean you are making rational arguments
- fallacy:: If I convince someone that means I am correct
- [[emotions]] can hijack you rational mind, if they do this you will be unable to rationally question your own beliefs
	- logic in a human brain is not in a vaccuum
- even if you don't feel your emotions doesn't mean you aren't being emotional, possibly because of [[Alexithymia]] 
	- [[Schizophrenia]] - cause a similar break between these two parts of the [[brain]] that leads to [[flat affect]]
- #TO/EXPLORE/READ [Inhibition of Action, Thought, and Emotion: A Selective Neurobiological Review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2396584/) about inhibatory circuits
	- [[Ventral Medial Prefrontal Cortex]] is inhibiting our [[emotions]] like [[fear]]
	- [[Reciprocal inhibition]]
- If are not aware of [[emotions]] that does not mean they don't exist and if you are aware you are actually more able to rational
	- this is where [[cognitive bias]], [[defense-mechanisms]], [[rationalizations]] come from
- if you are unable to experience the emotions then your [[defense-mechanisms]] are in control 
- to become more rational you need to gain emotional awareness
- [[Humans try really hard to avoid understanding their mistakes]]
- Even recognizing this trait in other people can lead to you falling into it. If you feel superior because other people are being ruled by their [[emotions]], you are being ruled by your emotions: [[Look for understanding before you look for solutions]]
