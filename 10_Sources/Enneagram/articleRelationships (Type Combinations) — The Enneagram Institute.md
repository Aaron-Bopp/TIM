## The Enneagram Type Combinations

No pairing of types is particularly blessed and no pairing is particularly doomed. These type combinations are an overview to help people understand some of the main positive and negative issues that are likely to arise between any two types.

Keep in mind that one can have a relationship with any type if the two people are healthy. Since this is not always the case, knowing the type, the level of health, and the instincts of each person can provide more insight.
