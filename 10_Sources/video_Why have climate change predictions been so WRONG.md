##### [[video_Why have climate change predictions been so WRONG]]
**Creator**:: [[Simon Clark]]
 
**Source**:: [Why have climate change predictions been so WRONG? - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4zul0BuO8A)

**Summary**:: Our predictions on [[climate change]] have actually been mostly correct, but the [[media]] has distorted these claims to serve the interests of [[capitalism]]. Evidence for this is a statistical review of climate predictions over time, and comparing those to measurements in good faith.
