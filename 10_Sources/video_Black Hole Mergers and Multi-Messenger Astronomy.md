**Summary**:: New research facilities have begun to detect more and more instances of [[Black holes]] merging together. They do this by shooting two lasers over four kilometers, having the merge at a perfect right angle, and then measure slight disturbances in the light waves. The mirrors that reflect the lasers are suspended such that the only disturbances can be from [[gravitational waves]]. You can then measure the intersection of these lasers and measure the disturbances, allowing you to detect events that happened over a billion years ago. As we detect more of these [[black hole mergers]], we can compare them and solve equations using [[general relativity]] and modifications of it to calculate the mass of these black holes. We can also detect the merging of [[neutron stars]], (which produces [[electro-magnetic radiation]]) and this could lead to discovering new celestial bodies. There are new observatory's being built across the globe.
