This is a working outline, so I am not going to try and preserve my current understanding as I ingest future chapters. The idea is that these concepts will be present across the book, and can later be abstracted into full fledged [[evergreen notes]]
# Concept Outline
## Modern views of ancient history

### People easily ignore history
 ![[books_The Dawn of Everything#258309232]]
 Most people only think about history to examine why things have gone wrong, they don't look to the history for answers. [[Empathy isn't understanding how you would make the decision it's understanding why they made the decision]] and people are not putting themselves in the shoes of ancient humans
### People frame ancient history to serve their interests

 We do question whether humans are innately good or evil, but those are human concepts
