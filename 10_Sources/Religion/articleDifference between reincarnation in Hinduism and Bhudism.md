**Covers**::  [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[eastern philosophy]]


- [[Hinduism]] believe in a persisting [[soul]] but [[Buddhism]] view [[reincarnation]] as a repeated occurrence of life [^1]


[^1]:  However, in [[Hinduism]], there is [[self]] (_Purusha_), which is permanent, eternal and unchanging. The entire universe is comprised of two things: [[consciousness]] and matter (_Purusha_ and _Prakriti_). Matter is our physical being while [[consciousness]] is part of our karmic results performed by the body (Warner, pars. 7–8). This all simply means that Hindus believe their [[consciousness|conscious]] is separate from their physical being. In Buddhism, however, there is no [[self]]. Buddhism sees rebirth not as the transmigration of a [[consciousness|conscious]] entity but as the repeated occurrence of the process of existence. There is a continuity, a transmission of influence, a causal connection between one life and another. But there is no [[soul]], no permanent entity which transmigrates from one life to another.” (Warner, par. 3).
