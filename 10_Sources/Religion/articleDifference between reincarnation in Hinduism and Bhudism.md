The idea of [[reincarnation]] began in India with the birth of [[Hinduism]]. Mike Oppenheim at _Let Us Reason Ministries_ says, “[[Reincarnation]] seems to be a prevalent view in our society today. Mankind has continually searched for answers about life and the afterlife, and there are various religions that promote differing views. [[Hinduism]], which is one of the oldest in the world, has influenced our culture more than any other…The word [[reincarnation]] means to come again in the flesh, _Re-in_\= to come again, _carnate_\= in the flesh. This is the successive embodiment of the [[soul]] in a series of mortal bodies.” (Oppenheim, pars. 1–5). Another [[religion]] in Asia also embodied the idea of [[reincarnation]], but with different spiritual beliefs about the meaning.

Buddhism began in India when Buddha, also known as Prince Siddhartha Gautama, reached [[enlightenment]] under the bodhi tree and discovered the Four Noble Truths (_Patheos Library_, par. 2) but, as with other religions, the issue of the afterlife needed to be addressed. Because [[Hinduism]] was prevalent during Siddhartha’s life, he adopted the idea of [[reincarnation]] (_Patheos Library_, pars. 2–3).

In both [[Hinduism]] and Buddhism you must reach [[enlightenment]] to obtain Nirvana, or the end of [[suffering]]. [[Hinduism]] views the reaching of Nirvana as having good [[karma]] and dharma in your previous lives (Sullivan, par. 1), while Buddhism holds that once you realize that life is [[suffering]], you can end the [[suffering]] (Bhikshu, par. 6).

 [[Reincarnation]] is where the two religions differ the most in regards to the afterlife. Both follow that lives recycle into new forms, that the cycle will continue and that each life is a goal to reach the end of the cycle (Warner, par. 4). However, in [[Hinduism]], there is [[self]] (_Purusha_), which is permanent, eternal and unchanging. The entire universe is comprised of two things: [[conscious|consciousness]] and matter (_Purusha_ and _Prakriti_). Matter is our physical being while [[conscious|consciousness]] is part of our karmic results performed by the body (Warner, pars. 7–8). This all simply means that Hindus believe their [[conscious]] is separate from their physical being. Their body is simply a container for their [[soul]] until that body dies and their [[soul]] moves on to another body, like a hermit crab outgrowing a shell. Another comparison is, “A man might take off one suit of clothing and put on another. The man remains the same but the suits of clothing are different. In the same way the [[soul]] remains the same but the psycho-physical organism it takes up differs from life to life.” (Warner par. 2). In Buddhism, however, there is no [[self]]. This belief is best explained by Melanie Warner at _BeyondTheNet_, “The Buddhist term for rebirth is _punabbhava_, which means “again existence.” Buddhism sees rebirth not as the transmigration of a [[conscious]] entity but as the repeated occurrence of the process of existence. There is a continuity, a transmission of influence, a causal connection between one life and another. But there is no [[soul]], no permanent entity which transmigrates from one life to another.” (Warner, par. 3).

[[Hinduism]] also teaches that you have an internal [[soul]] that continues in a process of [[reincarnation]] while inheriting [[karma]], which is the sum of a person’s actions and past actions reflecting on your placement in your next life. (Sullivan, par. 3). While Buddhists describe their rebirth as more of one life, a flickering candle, igniting another candle, or another life, and not an actual [[soul]] moving bodies as it does in [[Hinduism]]. (Lane par. 5).

Susan Lane from _AngelFire_ explains the difference between [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[reincarnation]] and Buddhist rebirth as, “[[Reincarnation]] means the assumption of another body by a permanent, eternal [[self]]. Most Buddhists do not believe in a permanent [[self]] but believe human [[conscious|consciousness]] dissolves at death and that only a subtle mindstream remains. The mindstream carries with it karmic imprints from prior lives (but not memories and emotions associated with prior lives) and it is this subtle mindstream that conjoins with a new life-form after death. Thus, rebirth does not mean an identifiable human being assuming a new human body.” (Lane pars. 3–4)

In conclusion, Buddhism regards rebirth as a flow of life from one to the other, while [[Hinduism]] views it as an actual [[soul]] changing the bodies it inhabits. And while these two ideas are vastly different, the idea of rebirth and [[reincarnation]] both include the belief that you will have many lives before you reach the end of [[suffering]] or Nirvana. But Buddhism does not see your [[soul]] shifting bodies, and [[Hinduism]] doesn’t see the mindstream. It seems that Buddhism and [[Hinduism]] beliefs about [[reincarnation]] are more different than alike.
