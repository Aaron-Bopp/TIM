## Summary
### Part One The [[Cognitive Revolution]]
Harari divides this part into four sections, *An Animal of No Significance*, *The Tree of Knowledge*, *A Day in the life of Adam and Eve*, and *The Flood*. Despite the obvious Biblical references, Harari does not discuss [[Christianity]] at all, instead choosing to tackle the fundamental mechanisms behind belief itself. This is only one small part of this first section, as Harari spends most of their time dissecting the path of [[human evolution]].

*An Animal of No Significance* gives an overview of the other species of the family homo, and how they connect to our own [[homo sapiens]]. 

Some of the insights include,
[[Cracking bones and eating the marrow may have been human's first niche]], and
[[Cooking allowed prehistoric humans to spend less energy on digesting]].

This leads into the major topic of the next section, [[Greater cooperation and communication has lead to the success of humans as a species]].

*The Tree of Knowledge* defines and describes the [[Cognitive Revolution]] and it's basis in our [[language]] and how it enables us to understand [[human interaction]] and transmit [[information]] through symbols in ways that no other language can. This leads to Harari's discussion of our [[Imagined reality]].
A spin off of these ideas is [[Social order is built off of a shared belief in an imagined reality]] and Harari also touched on [[Cultural evolution is not confined to the slow process of genetic evolution]].

As Harari gets into the weeds of our evolved [[Biology]] and prehistoric behavior he makes note that [[Biological processes can only give context to behavior not predict it]]. This will be important in the next section (and especially as we relate these topics to [[Evolutionary Psychology]]).

*A Day in the Life of Adam and Eve* starts to discuss how these ancients facts can affect our modern day [[psychology]]. Harari addresses many common beliefs about prehistoric human's such as the [[gorging gene]], and ideas about ancient family structure and behavior. They refuse to reinforce many of the myths that people try to use to justify their [[behavior]], stating that any attempt to reconstruct ancient human's lives from artifacts is extremely problematic as any foraging societies that have survived into modern times have done so in inhospitable areas and have been influenced by modern cultures. 
This leads then to discussing [[Hunter-gatherer societies were very diverse]].

Harari continues to discuss [[foraging]], touching on 
- [[Fishing villages are likely the most ancient human settlement]]
- [[Graves of ancient mammoth-hunters were vastly decorated]]

In the last part of this sections [[books_Sapiens#The Curtain of Silence]], Harari addresses the elephant in the room, how little we are actually able to know about ancient humans. We can guess and theorize all we went, but until we develop [[time travel]] we will have a limited [[understanding]] of ancient human [[society]].

The section of part 1, *The Flood* mainly discusses [[Human caused extinction is prevalent]], but also touches on [[homo sapiens]] ingenuity allowed them to conquer [[Siberia]] more than the better adapted [[Homo neanderthalis]] had, allowed them to travel to [[Australia]], and the Americas (and then then annihilate many of the species there).

### Part 2: The Agricultural Revolution
