How can we understand Earthâ€™s place in the universe? How did the rocks, air, and water that define our existence come to be? How do we explain our continents, mountains and valleys, earthquakes and volcanoes? What controls the composition of the atmosphere or of seawater? And how did the immense diversity of life all around us come to be? Perhaps most important, how are our own actions changing both Earth and life?
