**Hypothesis**:: "Contact theory and research provides a comprehensive conceptual foundation, allied to a range of powerful empirical techniques, for important new advances and practical applications for improving intergroup relations and producing more equitable outcomes across groups." ([John F. Dovidio et al 2017:607](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5PDNPFB?page=2))
  

"Across 713 independent samples from 515 studies, intergroup contact significantly improved outgroup attitudes (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006)" ([John F. Dovidio et al 2017:609](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5PDNPFB?page=4))

"this effect was reliably stronger when Allport's "prerequisite" conditions were met, intergroup contact still improved attitudes in the absence of these factors (mean rs = .29 vs. .20)" ([John F. Dovidio et al 2017:609](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5PDNPFB?page=4))

"Subsequent metaanalyses confirmed the efficacy of cross-group friendships (Davies, Tropp, Aron, Pettigrew, & Wright, 2011) and the effectiveness of contact interventions outside the lab (Lemmer & Wagner, 2015)." ([John F. Dovidio et al 2017:609](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5PDNPFB?page=4))

"contemporary research includes (a) extended, (b) vicarious, (c) imagined, and (d) virtual contact." ([John F. Dovidio et al 2017:609](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5PDNPFB?page=4))

"Extended contact, represents the idea that mere knowledge of an ingroup member's close, positive relationship with an outgroup member can reduce intergroup bias." ([John F. Dovidio et al 2017:609](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5PDNPFB?page=4))

"Furthermore, extended contact positively affects intergroup attitudes over and above the influence of direct intergroup contact" ([John F. Dovidio et al 2017:609](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5PDNPFB?page=4))

"Vicarious contact" ([John F. Dovidio et al 2017:609](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5PDNPFB?page=4))

"Observing the actions of another person, particularly someone with whom one identifies, can influence perceptions of how one should perform and/or expand one's personal knowledge and repertoire of possible behavior." ([John F. Dovidio et al 2017:609](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5PDNPFB?page=4))

"Imagined contact is an indirect form of contact in which individuals actively engage in mental simulation of a positive contact experience (Crisp & Turner, 2009)." ([John F. Dovidio et al 2017:609](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5PDNPFB?page=4))

"Pettigrew and Tropp's (2008) meta-analysis of intergroup contact mediators demonstrated that reductions in group-based anxiety and increases in empathy and perspective taking mediated contact effects more strongly than did enhanced knowledge of the other group." ([John F. Dovidio et al 2017:610](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5PDNPFB?page=5))

"Whether people perceive others as members of an ingroup or an outgroup critically affects how they think about, feel toward, and act toward others" ([John F. Dovidio et al 2017:610](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5PDNPFB?page=5))

"Contact can reduce prejudice by affecting social categorization in two ways, by (a) reducing the salience of group identities (decategorization), or (b) changing the ways people categorize others in the situation (recategorization)." ([John F. Dovidio et al 2017:610](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5PDNPFB?page=5))

"Alternatively, positive intergroup contact, particularly when it involves cooperative interaction or emphasizes shared goals or overlapping identities, can produce recategorization" ([John F. Dovidio et al 2017:610](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5PDNPFB?page=5))

"positive intergroup contact is often less effective at improving outgroup attitudes when it involves outgroup members perceived to be very atypical, rather than typical, of their group" ([John F. Dovidio et al 2017:611](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5PDNPFB?page=6))

"ositive contact tends to more strongly and consistently improve the attitudes of members of advantaged groups toward disadvantaged groups than vice versa." ([John F. Dovidio et al 2017:611](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5PDNPFB?page=6))

"minoritygroup members tend to perceive that they have experienced more discrimination in the past (Tropp, 2007) and anticipate greater prejudice and discrimination on the basis of their group membership (Tropp & Pettigrew, 2005), which can attenuate the impact of favorable intergroup contact." ([John F. Dovidio et al 2017:611](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5PDNPFB?page=6))

"the vast body of contact research shows that contact quality (or favorability) is more influential in changing intergroup attitudes than contact quantity" ([John F. Dovidio et al 2017:611](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5PDNPFB?page=6))

"However, recent research has further demonstrated the adverse effect of negative contact on intergroup attitudes and relations, and the processes underlying this effect (Hayward, Tropp, Hornsey, & Barlow, 2017)—including showing that negative contact increases category salience" ([John F. Dovidio et al 2017:611](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5PDNPFB?page=6))

"In intergroup interactions, members of majority groups seek to be liked and affirmed as moral by members of the minority group, whereas minority-group members are motivated to satisfy needs for respect and empowerment" ([John F. Dovidio et al 2017:612](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5PDNPFB?page=7))

"To achieve truly constructive intergroup relations, it is important that intergroup exchanges meet the psychological needs of both majorityand minority-group members" ([John F. Dovidio et al 2017:612](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5PDNPFB?page=7))

"Related temporal issues include when, developmentally, contact is most effective at improving attitudes (e.g., Wölfer et al., 2016) and whether preconflict contact has positive effects on postconflict attitudes" ([John F. Dovidio et al 2017:612](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5PDNPFB?page=7))

"Implicit attitudes, which are frequently measured using the Implicit Association Test" ([John F. Dovidio et al 2017:612](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5PDNPFB?page=7))

"In general, whereas contact quality tends to be more influential than contact quantity for explicit intergroup attitudes, contact quantity plays a primary role for implicit attitudes" ([John F. Dovidio et al 2017:613](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5PDNPFB?page=8))

"Moreover, whereas explicit attitudes, because they are more malleable, are positively influenced by recent favorable intergroup contact, implicit attitudes are much less affected by these experiences (e.g., Burke et al., 2017; van Ryn et al., 2015)." ([John F. Dovidio et al 2017:613](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5PDNPFB?page=8))

"For individuals belonging to stigmatized groups, stereotype threat (Steele, 2010) can be triggered by the awareness that others view their group as deficient in a particular domain, resulting in anxiety and reduced task performance. Positive intergroup contact, however, weakens the belief that the outgroup holds negative views of the ingroup (Tredoux & Finchilescu, 2010), and consequently intergroup contact— both direct and indirect—can eliminate stereotype threat among members of stigmatized groups (e.g., Abrams, Eller, & Bryant, 2006)." ([John F. Dovidio et al 2017:613](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5PDNPFB?page=8))

"Currently, societies are changing rapidly following unprecedented levels of migration, and these changes involve complicated issues of social identity among members of immigrant groups and members of the host country (Sam & Berry, 2010)." ([John F. Dovidio et al 2017:614](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y5PDNPFB?page=9))
