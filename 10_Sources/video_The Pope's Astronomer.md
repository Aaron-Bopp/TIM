##### [[video_The Pope's Astronomer]]
**Creator**:: 
 
**Source**:: [The Pope's Astronomer - Sixty Symbols - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0DAKaR16cY)

**Summary**:: Interesting discussion of [[religion]], [[science]], [[astronomy]], [[belief]], [[faith]], and their intersection. The astronomer, [[Guy Consolmagno]], offered a relation between faith and science that was not antagonistic, and actually they are working towards the same goal of a continually improving [[understanding]] of the mystery of life. He says that science will always be understandable but a little short of the truth, and that religion offers truths that we will never be able to understand. The opposite of [[faith]] isn't [[doubt]], the opposite of faith is certainty.
