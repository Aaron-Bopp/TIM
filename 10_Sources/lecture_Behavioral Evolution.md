## Notes

- [[biology]] can tell us a lot based off of our skulls
- There is a inevitable logic to how [[biology]] works because of the optimization of [[Evolution]]
- [[sociobiology]] in 1970s -> [[Evolutionary Psychology]]
- Basics of [[Evolution]]
	- Animals have traits
	- Those traits are heritable
	- Some traits are more adaptive than others
	- These traits lead to reproduction
	- This all leads to variance of traits in populations thanks to mutation
- Wynn-Edwards and group selection is the idea of "the good of the species" which is pretty much incorrect and can be explained other ways
- Three building blocks that abstract/replace [[natural selection]] and its derivatives
	- [[individual selection]]
		- behavior is how to preserve ones life and genes through reproduction ("selfish genes")
		- sexual selection would be a subset of this
	- inclusive fitness/[[kin selection]]
		- helping those you are closest related to in any situation
		- the more closely related you are with someone, the more genes you share with them
		- leads to us vs them thinking - [[Humans love to group eachother]]
	- [[reciprocal altruism]]
		- [[Evolution]] can lead to RPS stalemates where each organism has a weakness and a strength and their best interest is to work together
			- happens the most in [[bacteria]]
		- Major part: you aren't putting in more than you are getting
		- Works best in large, long-living, social species
		- selects for cheating, detecting cheating, and cheating in a way where you can get away with it
			- we are better at detecting cheating rather than kindness - [[Humans have decided to take advantage of an unjust world]]
		- lots of rules -> [[game theory]]
			- you scratch my back i'll scratch yours till you cut my back then ill cut yours
			- models to optimize theory i.e. [[Prisoner's dilemma]]
				- Highest payoff -> stab the other in the bad
				- Second highest -> cooperation
				- Third highest, sometimes punishment -> both stab
				- Worst -> you are the sucker
			- How to optimize?
				- Tit for tat
					- Cooperate as long as the other does
					- Forgives if the other person stops cheating
					- Vulnerability -> what if there is noise, where you think the other cheated but they didn't, leads to 50% less cooperation as you seesaw back and forth
						- Forgiving tit for tat 
							- If you seesaw so many times, be forgiving to see if you can get back to cooperation
							- vulnerability -> can be exploited, taken advantage of 
								- Transfer from tit for tat -> ftft once you trust your partner
								- Pavlov is the exploitive strategy
			- Perceived madness/signal noise examples
				- Vampire bats
					- feeding other bats kids
				- Sticklebat fish
					- Fish species changing sex
				- naked molerat
					- cooperative colonies
					- lazy members
						- plug the wholes during reproductive seasons
			- IRL strategies change
				- tournament species vs pair-bonding species/Parental Behavior discussion starting 1:20
					- we are somewhere in the middle

- In the 70s and 80s, we started to realize we weren't the only species that killed for pleasure
	- Infanticide comes from [[individual selection]], specifically lower class males killing other males youngs to free up females for themselves
		- this doesn't happen in families because of [[kin selection]]
		- Females solve for this by going into pseudo-ovulation to trick others in 
	- [[Robert Trivers]], sex ratio fluctuation
	- [[Adelphic polyandry]] happens in cases where you are trying to avoid spliltting up you inheritance and thus your chance of reproductive survival
- [[imprinted genes]] genes that work differently depending on which parent they came from, mainly comes from males and females not having the same reproductive strategy
- [[group selection]] has snuck back into [[ethology]] in the [[founder effect]] ^igzkks
	- this is a way to jump start cooperation in a [[population]]
	- good explanatino at 1:00
- [[books_Darwin's Cathedral]] David Sloan Wilson book about calvinism
- [[natural selection]] is the competition of individual items, whether those be genes, individuals, or groups
- Three main aspects of Behavioral Evolution
	- Heritability
		- this is the piece most attacked by other fields
	- Adaptiveness
		- leads to fallacy that everything is adaptive or selected for
			- sometimes it is hard to see why something is adaptive
			- something may have been adaptive at one point
			- the term for this is [[spandrel]]
				- example: human chins, you can have a shortened muzzle on a primate head without a chin
		- Gradualism
			- [[evolution]] is a tinkerer
			- counter is [[punctuated equilibrium]]
- There has been a [[Marxism|Marxist]] critique of [[Evolutionary Biology]] in that explaining things as "natural"  or a evolutionary selection, often ignores a materialistic analysis
