This study suggests that the greater power observed across loads in the CDL in men is likely the result of larger muscle mass, which contributes to greater strength levels. In terms of velocity, though men produce significantly higher absolute velocity at 30% 1-RM in the current study, women produce higher velocities across all loads when normalized to FFM. These data support the need to properly assess deficiencies in athletes in order to appropriately develop mixed model training programs to enhance muscular power.
