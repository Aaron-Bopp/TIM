### Chapter 1

This chapter concerns itself with orientating the reader to be ready for the rest of the book. This includes dispelling preconceived notions that people familiar with the field have, as well as defining several core concepts.
This book seems to be a rather influential in that it pushed for and re-popularized the power of [[group selection]] (or at least [[David Sloan Wilson]] did) after a period of intellectual vitriol from the scientific [[community]]. 
Wilson doesn't discredit the pushback against [[group selection]] but rather clarifies what it is and how it works.
He does this by finding the relation between social life and biological fitness, in short that even if a trait does not benefit an individual, if it benefits the group that individual is a part of it can survive and even thrive. 

Wilson also provides several caveats and warnings to prevent people from overestimating the influence of [[group selection]] as they did in the past. The first of these is that not every group is an adaptive unit. If there is not competition there is not driving force for [[group selection]] to take advantage of. 
The second is that groups must be defined every trait relative to the context that trait is meaningful in. He claims that every other theory of group selection (one's that rely on [[kin selection]] or [[game theory]]) can be explained using [[group selection]] by properly following these rules ^2db02f

This leads to the conclusions that
[[Functionally integrated social groups become organisms in their own right]] and
[[There is a social element to genetic evolution]].

Wilson then starts to take stabs at [[kin selection]] and [[reciprocal altruism]] in earnest. He claims that if you view history through the lense of human groups as moral communities you will see many behaviors that can only be attributed to [[group selection]]
All throughout this chapter Wilson starts to make reference to the relation of these [[Evolution|evolutionary]] concepts and religion, morality, and the [[human experience]]. 

#### Major concepts
- [[Greater cooperation and communication has lead to the success of humans as a species]]
- [[Evolutionary Psychology is just a framework not a prescription of behavior]]
- [[Biological processes can only give context to behavior not predict it]]
- [[Cultural evolution is not confined to the slow process of genetic evolution]]
