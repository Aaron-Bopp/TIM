##### ^blurb
*Darwin's Cathedral: Evolution, Religion, and the Nature of Society* is a 2002 book by [[David Sloan Wilson]] which proposes that [[religion]] is a multi-level adaptation—i.e., a product of [[cultural evolution]] developed through multi-level selection.

## Summaries
### Chapter 1

#### Church as an organism ^[[[books_Darwin's Cathedral#CHURCH AS ORGANISM]]]
This chapter concerns itself with orientating the reader to be ready for the rest of the book. This includes dispelling preconceived notions that people familiar with the field have, as well as defining several core concepts.
This book seems to be a rather influential in that it pushed for and re-popularized the power of [[group selection]] (or at least [[David Sloan Wilson]] did) after a period of intellectual vitriol from the scientific [[community]]. 
#### [[the fundamental problem of social life]] ^[[[books_Darwin's Cathedral#THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM OF SOCIAL LIFE]]]

> ![[books_Darwin's Cathedral#^288457438]]

#### DARWIN’S SOLUTION TO THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM ^[[[books_Darwin's Cathedral#DARWIN’S SOLUTION TO THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM]]]
His examination of this problem includes looking at Darwin's solution, the reason it became a problem in later years, and then a thorough discussion of how to solve it.

#### EVOLUTIONARY THEORY’S WRONG TURN ^[[[books_Darwin's Cathedral#EVOLUTIONARY THEORY’S WRONG TURN]]]
Wilson doesn't fully discredit the pushback against [[group selection]] but rather clarifies what it is and how it works, in light of the many problems and solutions that came as a result of rejecting [[group selection]].

 ![[group selection#^e8dce2]] 

Wilson then starts to take stabs at [[kin selection]] and [[reciprocal altruism]] in earnest. He claims that if you view history through the lense of human groups as moral communities you will see many behaviors that work much better as a result of [[group selection]] then can be explained as a result of genetic relatives or those who will return the favor.


This leads to the conclusions that
[[There is a social element to genetic evolution]],
[[Functionally integrated social groups become organisms in their own right]] and
[[Social control allows groups to function as adaptive units]]. 

All throughout this chapter Wilson starts to make reference to the relation of these [[Evolution|evolutionary]] concepts and religion, morality, and the [[human experience]]. 
As he does this he starts to expand from [[group selection]] to [[Evolutionary Psychology]] and [[Cultural Evolution]].

Wilson again takes issue with and redefines [[Evolutionary Psychology]] to better reflect it's place in our understanding of [[human behavior]]. He pushes back against the "jukebox" argument that modern behaviors are just choosing records from our ancient [[biology]]. His main argument here is that this oversimplifies and over specifies.
He remarks that [[Evolutionary Psychology is just a framework not a prescription of behavior]], but
his main point is that [[Evolutionary Psychology]] is only being partially applied.
[[Genetic evolution]] does not need to lead to modular traits because
[[Evolution can create systems capable of natural selection]].
^[[[books_Darwin's Cathedral#^292936697]]]

This leads him fully into [[Cultural Evolution]], a process that does not change genes in the slightest and yet is highly adaptive and competitive. He offers four insights from [[group selection]] and then comes back to how human's form into adaptive groups.

![[Cultural Evolution#^68bb63]]

This leads to [[Cultural evolution is not confined to the slow process of genetic evolution]]
and [[Greater cooperation and communication has lead to the success of humans as a species]].


#### THE RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION OF MORALITY ^[[[books_Darwin's Cathedral#THE RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION OF MORALITY]]]

Finally this leads him to start directly connecting these ideas to [[religion]], through the idea that [[Belief can motivate adaptation]] and [[Religion promotes high social control]]

### Chapter 2
Wilson first reviews his reasons for approaching the subject of [[religion]], pointing out the not so obvious connections to [[Evolution]] that people in the social sciences have made. For this reasons he is going to turn and look at religion from their perspective first.
