### Chapter 1

This chapter concerns itself with orientating the reader to be ready for the rest of the book. This includes dispelling preconceived notions that people familiar with the field have, as well as defining several core concepts.
This book seems to be a rather influential in that it pushed for and re-popularized the power of [[group selection]] (or at least [[David Sloan Wilson]] did) after a period of intellectual vitriol from the scientific [[community]]. 
Wilson doesn't discredit the pushback against [[group selection]] but rather clarifies what it is and how it works.
He does this by finding the relation between social life and biological fitness, in short that even if a trait does not benefit an individual, if it benefits the group that individual is a part of it can survive and even thrive. 

 ![[group selection#^e8dce2]] 

This leads to the conclusions that
[[Functionally integrated social groups become organisms in their own right]] and
[[There is a social element to genetic evolution]].

Wilson then starts to take stabs at [[kin selection]] and [[reciprocal altruism]] in earnest. He claims that if you view history through the lense of human groups as moral communities you will see many behaviors that work much better as a result of [[group selection]] then can be explained as a result of genetic relatives or those who will return the favor.

All throughout this chapter Wilson starts to make reference to the relation of these [[Evolution|evolutionary]] concepts and religion, morality, and the [[human experience]]. 
As he does this he starts to expand from [[group selection]] to [[Evolutionary Psychology]] and [[Cultural Evolution]].

Wilson again takes issue with and redefines [[Evolutionary Psychology]] to better reflect it's place in our understanding of [[human behavior]]. He pushes back against the "jukebox" argument that modern behaviors are just choosing records from our ancient biology. His main argument here is that this oversimplifies and over specifies. Genetic evolution does not need to lead to modularity and can instead create an environment capable of complex responses.
His main point being [[Evolutionary Psychology is just a framework not a prescription of behavior]] 
and [[Biological processes can only give context to behavior not predict it]]

This leads him fully into [[Cultural Evolution]], a process that does not change genes in the slightest and yet is highly adaptive and competitive. He offers four insights from [[group selection]] and then comes back to how human's form into adaptive groups.

![[Cultural Evolution#^68bb63]]
This leads to [[Cultural evolution is not confined to the slow process of genetic evolution]]
and [[Greater cooperation and communication has lead to the success of humans as a species]].

Finally this leads him to start directly connecting these ideas to [[religion]], through the idea that [[Belief can motivate adaptation]] and [[Religion promotes high social control]]
