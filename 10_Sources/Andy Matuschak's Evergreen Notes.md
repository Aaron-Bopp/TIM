- [[evergreen notes]]s evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time/projects
	- [[evergreen notes]]s support knowledge, transient notes don't
- [[evergreen notes]]s should be:
	- atomic
	- concept oriented
	- densely linked
	- organically structural
- My reading inbox is  the to(do) structure and my writing inbox is the ever(green) structure [[my TO(DO) and EVER(GREEN) structure]]

So we explore some part of our prior web of notes, which may lead us somewhere unexpected.

- > These are often declarative or imperative phrases making a strong claim. This puts pressure on me to adequately support the claim in the body. If I write a note but struggle to summarize it in a sharp title, that’s often a sign that my thinking is muddy or that this note is about several topics"
- - > "define a new node extensionally (rather than intensionally) by simply linking to it from many other nodes—even before it has any content"
