#### Notes

- Two major points of the course:
	1. Sometimes the stuff that is happening in your [[body]] affects your [[brain]]
	2. Sometimes the stuff that is happening in your [[brain]] will affect the rest of your [[body]]
- This class is about understanding the conclusions that can be drawn from different categories of science and questioning them by looking at the big picture
	- The way we categorize the things affects how we understand them and remember them
		- Strings of numbers are easier to remember when they are arranged as phone numbers 
	- When you are paying to much attention to categories, you will miss how things fall on the edge
		- The way we name colors effects how we perceive them
	- When you pay to much attention to boundaries you don't see the big picture
	- > When you think in categories, you underestimate how different two facts are when they fall in the same category. When you think in categories, you overestimate how different they are when there happens to be a boundary in between them. And when you pay attention to categorical boundaries, you don't see big pictures. Now, what our goal in this class is going to be is think about this big, complex issue of the biology of behavior without falling into thinking in categories.
	- [[Prioritize organization over categorization to avoid cognitive bias]]
- Some of the "greatest" scientists in the last hundred years were completely stuck within their own categories. This lead to things such as lobotomy and eugenics.
