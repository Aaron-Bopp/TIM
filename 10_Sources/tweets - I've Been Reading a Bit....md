I've been reading a bit of Gandhi's autobiography and it's stranger than I expected. He was a weird and severe kid, obsessive-paranoid about morality, talked a lot about shame, cowardice, remorse – even before any significant event or context shaping him in that way

it's more than that, though – I don't know how to convey this – reading about a kid growing up in 1870s India in some respects feels like reading about an alien from another planet. There are some human condition universals, but they only sharpen the differences, for me

which then makes me think – I used to read a lot of old books growing up, and they were all different, too. and... being extremely online and reading contemporary shit all day does have a sort of tunnel-vision effect. the way we live, the way we think, the way we talk...
