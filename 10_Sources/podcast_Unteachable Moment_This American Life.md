Starbucks held national implicit bias training after an incident in one of their stores. This training consisted of a day long employee lead training seminar. Starbucks all accross the country were closed, and there would be more trainings in the coming months. The training did not focus on the specific incident (a black person not being a allowed to use the bathroom because they had not purchased a drink), but rather focused on bias and prejudice in general. While there were some specific references to Starbucks specific scenarios most of it was general. The conversations ranged from how white people react to natural hair, to incidents with black customers, to differences between people. National feedback to this move by Starbucks was mixed, but it was quickly overshadowed by the Roseanne incident. Starbucks CEO was interestingly hostile when the public relations nature of this move was addressed by reporters.
