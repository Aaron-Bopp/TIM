- Is there a way to get rid of the burden of whiteness? -> No
	- teaching intellectual habits
		- acknowledging the situations of your life 
		- set of questions that work in every situation
			- who are you in the room
			- how did you get there
- Difference between addressing race (and [[white supremacy]]) and addressing societal ills ([[prison-industrial complex]])
	- White people are scared to engage in race or if they aren't they do it through political jargon
		- White people have often never had to address their race
	- ?==Is it more comfortable talking about race in homogeneous company or mixed company==?
