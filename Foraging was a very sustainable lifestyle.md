#### [[Foraging was a very sustainable lifestyle]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Foraging]] was the main mode of life for hundreds of millennia of [[human evolution]]. It wasn't until [[Farming outcompeted foraging by allowing for higher populations]] that it dropped from the top spot, and that mainly because [[Farming prevented a return to foraging for early humans]].

The three main aspects that made foraging sustainable were:
- [[Foraging kept populations down]]
- [[Foraging allowed for a diverse diet]]
- [[Foragers suffered less from disease]]
