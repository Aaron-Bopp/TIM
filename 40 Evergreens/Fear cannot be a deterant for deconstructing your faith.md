#### [[Fear cannot be a deterant for deconstructing your faith]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Fear of hell is baked into Christianity]] Another fear people have is fear of social consequences, especially the reaction of [[parents]] who have worked in or attended the church for a long time.

[[Deconstructing your faith is like climbing through a jungle canopy]], and often you can't view [[Christianity]] objectively until you reach the top. Depending on your level of [[indoctrination]] and your continued involvement in the church you may have a more objective view of the [[Christianity]] already, but I don't think you can get rid of the fear of hell, or the fear of judgment, or the fear of "worldlyness" until you get to the top. 

Some people can never truly reach objectivity with [[Christianity]] because they have had legitimate spiritual experiences or have experienced a personal relationship with god. Despite the reality of these things, those experiences are very much real and are often the main reason people stay in the church.

If you can never get to this place of objectivity you may get stuck feeling like you're [[Deconstructing your faith can feel like constructing a puzzle that you haven't seen before | constructing a puzzle you haven't seen before ]]
