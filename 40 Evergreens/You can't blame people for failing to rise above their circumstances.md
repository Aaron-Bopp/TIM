#### [[You can't blame people for failing to rise above their circumstances]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Most humans will not rise above their situation. In fact it could be said that no person does depending on your belief in [[free-will]]. [[modern american culture]] often blames people for not "pulling themselves up by their bootstraps." This widespread belief is mainly due to [[propaganda]] that is spread about [[America]]'s superiority (and thus largely rooted in [[white supremacy]]), but can be seen around the world. People lack the [[empathy]] to understand why other people would make decisions differently than they would, but [[empathy isn't understanding how you would make the decision it's understanding why they made the decision]]. I think a lot of the reliance on this belief is built up because of [[inter-generational trauma]] and because of the [[socio-economic]] situations of the last 50-100 years. 

Blaming people for failing to rise above their situation is not only unfair, it is unsupported by evidence. #TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH
