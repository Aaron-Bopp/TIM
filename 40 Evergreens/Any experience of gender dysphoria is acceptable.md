#### [[Any experience of gender dysphoria is acceptable]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Gender Dysphoria]] does not have to be a strong sense of being completely in the wrong body and completely the wrong [[gender]] with all the wrong body parts. Simlar to [[Any experience of gender is acceptable]], any experience of [[gender dysphoria]] is acceptable and you don't need to dysphoria to be trans. People will experience [[gender]] differently and any inconsistency with other [[transgender|trans]] people does not invalidate their existence. 

[[Gender is both an intrinsic experience and an necessary expression]], so [[gender dysphoria]] can affect many different aspects of your life.

 Dysphoria can be any sense unease or generalized dissatisfaction with life but in [[transgender|trans]] people can develop into [[self-hate]], because [[Self-hatred is born out of dissonance between self-image and self-perception]].
 
 Experiences  of gender dysphoria:
 - [[Gender Dysphoria is based in a intrinsic wrongness of self]]
