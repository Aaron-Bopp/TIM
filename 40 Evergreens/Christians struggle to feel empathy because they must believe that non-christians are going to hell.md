#### [[Christians struggle to feel empathy because they must believe that non-christians are going to hell]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

One of the core belief's or [[Christianity]] is that we have [[free-will]]. This is important for a couple reasons, we must have the [[free-will]] to choose God's [[love]], and we must have the [[free-will]] to choose to sin. This is the basis of the genesis story and our "sin nature." This belief is also the main reason [[Fear of hell is baked into Christianity]]. Hell is allowed to be such a horrible place because you choose to be in it by refusing god's grace.

Because [[free-will]] is so integral to loving god and avoiding punishment, it becomes a core part of the [[Christianity | christian]] [[worldview]], and when they see a non-believer they [[subconscious | subconsiously]] know that person has made the choice to go to hell and judge them for it (this is why [[Worldviews are wrong if they make life seem easy and simple]]) This plays a large part in the drive for evangelism and mission work, but it also changes [[Christianity|Christian]]'s relationships with others. 

How can you love someone you know is condemned to death? How can you bear to live in a world where some people will suffer eternally? How can you bear it?

If christian's were feeling empathy fully for these people that would recieve enternal punishment they wouldn't be able to go on, they wouldn't be able to do anything but evangelize or praise god for allowing them to be spared. Christians that don't do this are experiencing [[cognitive dissonance]], but it has been so ingrained into them that will never acknowledge it [[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]].
