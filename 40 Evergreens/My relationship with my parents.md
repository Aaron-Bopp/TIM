#### [[My relationship with my parents]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

My relationship with [[my parents]] is rocky at best. I think that I broke my dad a little bit when I told him I wasn't a [[Christianity|christian]] anymore. It was the most hateful I had ever seen him, but I know that a lot of it is because of the grief of his dad's death that I don't think he's ever been able to work through. He really needs therapy... 

I think at a certain point you can't teach an old dog new tricks. It's kind of hard for me because I know [[In order to for my parents to love me, they need to admit they might be wrong]]

 -> [[My unfulfilled need for parental validation became a fear of rejection and disregarment of affection]]
