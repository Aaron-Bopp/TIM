We can [[sympathy|sympathize]] with why somebody did something without excusing their actions. This is an important part of [[non-punitive justice]] and why [[Prison abolition]] is possible. We cannot hope for someone if we have [[judgement|judged]] them and if we cannot hope for someone how can we [[human advancement|advance]].
