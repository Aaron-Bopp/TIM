#### [[Identity is your understanding of yourself vs your interaction with the world]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Identity is a sense of self not a pattern of traits or behavior

At the core of [[self]] is how you view yourself ([[self-image]]) vs how the world views you ([[self-perception]]). If you have a weak [[self-image]] then how the worlds views you will completely win, resulting in little to no sense of [[self]] e.g. [[Self-hatred is born out of dissonance between self-image and self-perception]].

Many people will think they have a strong [[self]], but in actuality this [[self]] is just there concerted efforts to conform to society's views. Other's may feel a very strong sense of [[self]] because their in sense of [[self]] is aligned with society's view of them.

Those who think they have a weak [[self]] have either realized that they do not have a sense of [[self]] outside of how other's treat them, or that they do not reveal their inner sense of [[self]] to other people. [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]]

However, [[self]] is more than just an objective viewing of our actions. [[self]] is also impacted by the physical reactions that our bodies go through.   If we feel a certain way during an interaction that will impact our [[self]], either through a [[conscious]] viewing and reflection on that feeling, or a [[subconscious]] reaction to either avoid or pursue that feeling again. [[Complex emotions are intellectual understandings of primal urges]]

If your understanding of the world is impaired that means that your [[self]] will be hard to understand.
