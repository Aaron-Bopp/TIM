#### [[Your anxiety is telling you everything that could go wrong not what will go wrong]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

If you can acknowledge that what your [[anxiety]] is telling you could happen but will not certainly happen you can start to make the judgment on whether you should go through with the thing or not. [[Social anxiety isn't irrational it's just overcompensation]]

Being able to do this requires a very healthy amount of [[mindfullness]], and a large amount of [[self]]-awareness. Once you've achieved these things you're [[anxiety]] can start to be an aspect of your [[mindfullness]] rather than an inhibitor. ([[Anxiety should be a tool at your disposal not an impedance to your life]]) [[Self-hatred is born out of dissonance between self-image and self-perception]]

[[Anxiety]] can be very overwhelming because you are getting a non-stop feed of every negative situation that could happen. () These thoughts can often feel very irrational because we know that not every bad thing will happen, but our [[subconscious]]/[[subconscious]] does not know that. [[We value our biggest insecurities because they protect us from the biggest threats]]

The reason this happens is rooted in [[Neuroscience]]. [[Anxiety]] is at it's core a warning system, which means that it is a big part of [[human survival]]/[[human advancement]]. As we satisfy more and more of the [[Hierachy of Needs]] our need for such an advanced warning system grows less and less. In modern society, our [[anxiety]] can seem like a irrational response, but it is just our brain doing what is has evolved to do. #TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH Is modern over compensation or just the next natural step in human [[Evolution]].

#TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH Is [[anxiety]] purely involuntary or can it come out of obsessiveness/[[OCD]]?

[[Your insecurity is just more avenues for your anxiety to take advantage of]] which is only made worse by the fact [[Your anxiety knows your insecurities better than you do]].
