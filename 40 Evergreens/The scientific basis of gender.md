#### [[The scientific basis of gender]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

> Present evidence seems to suggest that a personâ€™s [[gender]] is established during gestation while the cerebral cortex of the brain is forming

[[Every person has an experience of gender]] but that does not mean gender is not a [[social construct]]. Gender has a very solid basis in [[Behavioral Pyschology]] and there are thousands of mechanisms and that cause gender to exist from generation to generation see [[Our understanding of gender begins at a very early age]].

If your assigned gender does not match your true gender your body will produce biological warnings ([[depression]], [[depersonalization]], [[derealization]], and [[dissociation]]), which are all symptoms of [[gender dysphoria]].
