#### [[Yang's political success was due to his common sense campaign]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Yang's success in the 2020 primary was and always will be of note. As a relative outsider, he was able to gain a large amount of [[grassroot support]] from both sides of the aisle. He did this by identifying problems of the world in an data driven way that did not overtly offend either party. He cast himself as a successful but empathetic [[business]] man who would be able to navigate the political landscape while being still being an outsider. He did this by basing his campaign on policy and technological change. While Yang did not significantly impact the 2020 race, but he did bring [[UBI]] to the forefront of American's mind and gave himself name recognition that put him at the head of the NYC Mayoral race one year later. Unfortunately this is where Yang failed, [[Yang's political failure was due to lack of activism and poltical inneficacy]].

The largest positive effect of Yang's campaign was the way it brought many people into the political progress. His message resonated with people who were disillusioned with politics, by giving the solutions for change. Many of these people have remained politically active and have even become more [[progressive]] than Yang.
