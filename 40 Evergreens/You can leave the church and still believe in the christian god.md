#### [[You can leave the church and still believe in the christian god]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Plenty of people leave the church but still have [[faith]], or are trying to improve church even if they don't have [[faith]]. There's also a really big community of ex-christians who lead all different kinds of spiritual lives. Athiesm is not the only route for [[Deconstruction (Christianity)]] its just the route I took.

While [[Christians struggle to feel empathy because they must believe that non-christians are going to hell]], many [[Christianity|Christians]] have developed a relationship with what they see as a very empathetic god, but when they are confronted with the horrors that the Church has put people through ([[The many transgressions of the christian church]]) they have no choice but to either reconsider their relationship with god or their relationship with the church. Often it is very hard to stay in the church because while you are trying to change and fix the evil things the church is doing, it is pushing back at you.
