#### [[Sadness is enlightenment and happiness is delusion]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

If a person internalizes the narrative that negative emotions are a sign of intelligence, it can warp their [[realism|realistic]] [[perception]] of the world, because [[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]].

<u>[[What is the cognitive effect of living in a unjust world|What is the cognitive effect of living in a unjust world?]]</u>

Once a person has set up this belief that negative emotion is associated with intelligence, you can struggle to find [[happiness]] in bleak situations, and find it easy to find [[sadness]] in neutral situations. Often as your intelligence and knowledge of the world increases, you will find that the only proper reaction is increasing sadness. [[Knowledge of the world is painful]], but [[Accepting responsibility is not only about your actions]].


This way of living your life is [[subconscious|subconsciously]] attractive, because you will think your increasing sadness is a sign of your increasing intelligence, while your fear of the possibility of hope grows stronger.  This [[feedback loop]] leads to inaction, [[depression]], [[pessimism]]

What is the path out?

Once someone has reached this state of "[[enlightenment]]," they will not only find it incredibly hard to be happy, they will see any [[happiness]] they do find as illogical, unnatural, and generally unwarranted, but [[Realism must acknowledge optimism's existence and effectiveness]]. It may be something small, it may be something massive, or they may just get bored of being cynical and come to think [[Happiness is enlightenment and sadness is delusion]].
