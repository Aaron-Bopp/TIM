#### [[McCarthyism is an attack on totalitarianism not communism]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Let us first establish what even an anti-communist like [[Truman]] understands that the [[Communism]] practiced by the [[Russia|USSR]] was, "not [[Communism]] under any circumstances, it is [[totalitarianism]] of the worst brand." ([[McCarthyism sources]], Doc 6) When [[Hoover]] and McCarthy describe [[Communism]] they are inaccurately lumping together actual [[Communism]] with [[totalitarianism]].  [[Hoover]] and McCarthy do not do much to develop any idea of "[[America|Americanism]]" but they speak endlessly of what is un-American. This kind of political double speech is often called a dog whistle and is the tool of White Nationalists and Supremacists. This made clear when [[Hoover]] identifies the antidote to [[Communism]] as, "vigorous, intelligent, old-fashioned [[America|Americanism]], with eternal vigilance." ([[McCarthyism sources]], Doc3) [[Hoover]] and McCarthy's statements are full of fear-mongering such as, "communists have developed one of the greatest [[propaganda]] machines the world has ever known," ([[McCarthyism sources]], Doc 3) when the modern sources reveal that the American Communist Party was never a large or profoundly influential institution([[McCarthyism sources]], Doc 5). They also intro the slander that has been slung at any [[Democratic]] politician remotely liberal for the past 70 years, "being the bedfellow of international [[Communism]]." ([[McCarthyism sources]], Doc 4) Of course, they both provide little course of action against this "dire" threat of political movement that supports, "old-age security, houses for veterans, child assistance" and secures the support of [[Christianity|Christian]] ministers. ([[McCarthyism sources]], Doc 3) McCarthy asks directly that [[Truman]] root out the 57 communists that work in the State Department that had been 205 communists only two days earlier ([[McCarthyism sources]], Doc 4). [[Hoover]] takes a less direct but far more effective root of calling on those who believe they have, "vigorous, intelligent, old-fashioned [[America|Americanism]]" to have "eternal vigilance," which was no doubt an encouragement to any listeners who may have wished to violently oust these dangerous Communists. The only definition of someone who is "American" that I can infer from these documents statements is someone who is willing to protect a document written in the 18th century that has had to be amended thirty-three times in order to provide for basic rights, ([[McCarthyism sources]], Doc 2, [[purpose]] 2) and will do anything to stop Communists from pushing the [[government]] to provide them more rights. The "[[America|Americanism]]" that [[Hoover]] and McCarthy promote is one and the same with the [[white supremacy|cultural homogeneity]] that justified the separate but equal doctrine that was deemed unconstitutional in 1954 (Lecture 19, part 2). 

McCarthy's attack on [[Communism]] is an integral foundation for [[Reagan]]'s presidency and the [[Rise of Modern Conservatism]]. ([[Ronald Reagan invented modern conservatism]]) It also played a large role in vilifying the word [[Communism]] in the eyes of the American public [[American's are scared of the word communism not it's meaning]]
