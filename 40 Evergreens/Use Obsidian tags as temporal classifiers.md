#### [[Use Obsidian tags as temporal classifiers]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

In [[Obsidian (software)]] tags do little more than open a search box with the appropriate search item, and you cannot add any markdown or metadata to them. You can make hierarchies of tags, which I use for my [[my TO(DO) and EVER(GREEN) structure]], which allows for more granularity in what a tag describes, and groups them together in the tag pane. 

This is why I use tags as **temporal classifiers.** 

Tags become much more powerful through the use of various plugins. Tags can be used as the parameter for a [[Dataview]] search, which means that you don't need to store all notes of a certain in a folder. They can also be used with plugins like [[Spaced Repetition (plugin)]] to allow you to review all or your \#evergreen notes. This is why I usually include tags in all of my major note templates ([[Note taxonomy]])
