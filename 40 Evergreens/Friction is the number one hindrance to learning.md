#### [[Friction is the number one hindrance to learning]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

What causes friction?
- A difficult problem 
- Forgetting what you already learned
- [[ADHD]]
- A bad learning environment
- A bad teacher

These force you to keep focusing back on the problem from distractions. Prerequisite knowledge you need, constantly shifting things in and out of your working memory, avoiding and pushing past loud noises or strong emotions, figuring out something you were told is wrong.

Good systems for learning reduce this friction:
- Libraries
- [[Adderall]]
- [[Spaced repetition]]
- Good teachers 
- [[internet| The Internet]]
- [[Obsidian (software)]]
- Knowing your tools
- Breaking down problems into smaller pieces

**We will evolve when we make learning as easy as thinking**
