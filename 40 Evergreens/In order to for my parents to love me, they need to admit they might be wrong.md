#### [[In order to for my parents to love me, they need to admit they might be wrong]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

In order for me to feel like [[my parents]] [[love]] me, I need to see them empathize with me --> which requires them too consider the fact that they might be wrong. 

[[empathy]] requires being able to put yourself in someone else shoes. For [[my parents]] this would mean recognizing that I may be right and that god doesn't exist. The reason this is so important to their [[love]] for me, is because there [[love]] for me is contingent on my being a [[Christianity|Christian]]. 

[[Loving a a non-believer requires loving the fact that they are going to hell]]. For me, the [[Evangelicalism]] interpretation of hell, is so hateful, and destructive, that I cannot believe that the [[love]] [[my parents]] feel for me is real. If they did [[love]] me, they would not be able to live with the belief that I am going to hell. Similarly, [[Christians struggle to feel empathy because they must believe that non-christians are going to hell]]. 

This issue is not black and white, the [[love]] that [[my parents]] feel for me is real, but it is not as real, or as full as if I was a [[Christianity | Christian]]. They may never admit that their [[love]] is not real, but they admit that they do not [[love]] me as much as they would if I was a [[Christianity|Christian]]. I think that may be a thought that they have had.
