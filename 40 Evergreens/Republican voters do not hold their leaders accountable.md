#### [[Republican voters do not hold their leaders accountable]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

 [[Reagan]]'s campaigns were full of unfulfilled promises, but his rhetoric and charm were enough to keep his approval rating high for his entire two terms.

 They still align various political causes with moral imperatives including, "the establishment of a pro-growth tax code," ([[Excerpts from the 2016 Republican Party Platform]], pg 2) and claim that the only way to bring, "safety to [America's] citizens," ([[Excerpts from the 2016 Republican Party Platform]], pg 4) is through a [[Republican]] president. Republicans also continue in his trend of campaigning on things that they put no effort towards doing, including abolishing [[abortion]], opposing tax policies that, "divide [[America|Americans]] or promote class warfare," ([[Excerpts from the 2016 Republican Party Platform]], pg 2) and of course balancing the budget.
