#### [[Self-reppression is the most natural response for trans people in strongly gendered environments]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

Trans people can look at [[Observational learning]] and [[gender schema]]'s and find explanations for why they may have never questioned their gender until late in life. Studies like the Pike and Jennings commercial study in 2005 [^1] show that children as young as 5 and 6 have a gender schema, and it impacts how they learn about the world ([[Children do what they see]]). This means that trans people could observe, imitate, and limit themselves to gendered behavior for their assigned gender without ever performing behaviors for their actual gender, and even if they did, punishment (especially from strongly gendered authority figures ie parents, [[childhood trauma]]) for that behavior would reinforce their gender schema. 

This is why thoughts like [[You're never sure if you're trans]] is so important to deal with and overcome.
