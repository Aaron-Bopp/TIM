#### [[You're not afraid of falling off the cliff you're afraid of jumping off the cliff]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

> people were misinterpreting a safety signal from their brains...In that situation (when you're on a cliff, or a bridge, or driving past an oncoming car), your mind is actually saying, ‘You’re in an unsafe situation—back up from the ledge.’ People...can misinterpret that and think, ‘I must have reacted that way because I wanted to jump...’ People who are more sensitive to symptoms of [[anxiety]]...are more likely to experience HPP [^1] than those who are less sensitive (though this only applies if they’ve never thought about [[suicide]])" [^2]
