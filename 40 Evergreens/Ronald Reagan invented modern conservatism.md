#### [[Ronald Reagan invented modern conservatism]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Reagan]] set the standard for [[Conservatism]] that stands to this day. His three major beliefs were religious [[Conservatism]] ([[Moral majority]]), [[anti-liberalism]], and financial [[Conservatism]] ([[supply-side economics]]). The most impactful of these beliefs is financial [[Conservatism]], which has also been called Reaganomics and [[supply-side economics]].

Much of this belief is based on the incorrect assumption that [[Reagan]] said so plainly in his 1964 speech, "But the truth is that outside of its legitimate function, [[government]] does nothing as well or as economically as the private sector." [^1]  These kinds of beliefs push the idea that the only good [[government]] is a small [[government]], which [[Reagan]] espoused in his 1981 inaugural address, "In this present crisis, [[government]] is not the solution to our problem; [[government]] is the problem." [^2]

 In opposition to these small-[[government]] beliefs, [[Reagan]] pushed for large [[government]] in many other ways. [[Reagan]] aligned the American [[government]] with religious and moral superiority and his enemy (the [[Russia|USSR]]) with secularism and moral inferiority. He used this logic to justify his opposition of the nuclear freeze which aimed to help end [[the Cold War]]. [^3] Some historians point to this and his increase in military spending as reasons for the [[Russia|USSR]]'s collapse, while others cite Eastern European nations and internal issues as factors. [^4]

[[Reagan]] then went back on his word and increased [[government]] spending that helped to bring the [[economy]] back from the 1982 crash.

He also used this moral superiority to justify [[government]] interference in woman's right to choose. ([[Ronald Reagan Evil Empire Speech]])

[[Republican voters do not hold their leaders accountable]]

 Modern republicans have followed this to a tee, but one way they have superseded him is that [[Republicans have become a true opposition party]].
