#### [[How to represent a todo list]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

The only required piece of a [[SecondBrain/OrganizationalNotes/TODO]] list is that it is temporary. The items on your [[SecondBrain/OrganizationalNotes/TODO]] list will get done eventually, but how quickly you expect them to get done is up to you. If you like your [[SecondBrain/OrganizationalNotes/TODO]] list to be a running list of quick task those things may get done quickly. If you prefer your [[SecondBrain/OrganizationalNotes/TODO]] list of items that you would like to do at some point you may be looking at those items for quite a while before they get finished.

The way you represent a [[SecondBrain/OrganizationalNotes/TODO]] note will vary system to system and person to person. The most important thing is that you are able to find the things you need [[SecondBrain/OrganizationalNotes/TODO]] quickly and easily. This can mean having a [[evergreen notes]] where you are your todos whenever you think of them, or a feature like a tag or unique symbol that will allow you to find them easily in other notes. You can also create more narrow representations of [[SecondBrain/OrganizationalNotes/TODO]]'s if the way you will interact is significantly different. Once you have completed a [[SecondBrain/OrganizationalNotes/TODO]], it should be removed from your [[SecondBrain/OrganizationalNotes/TODO]] list.

My [[SecondBrain/OrganizationalNotes/TODO]] list is represented by [[my TO(DO) and EVER(GREEN) structure]]. This works because I am not going to my [[SecondBrain/OrganizationalNotes/TODO]] list as a daily task, so I am okay with items sitting in there for a long time. The ever/green structure is also meant to be permanent because [[evergreen notes]]s are always changing and growing. For to/do tags, once I finish a task I remove the tag which clears up the [[Obsidian (software)]] tag [[SEARCH]] for other tasks.
