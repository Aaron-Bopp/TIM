#### [[my TO(DO) and EVER(GREEN) structure]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

This structure is how I [[Make your inbox into an entry point]] and is deeply entwined with [[Use Obsidian tags as temporal classifiers]] as a part of [[My Second Brain]]. 

I prefer this kind of todo list because I can create it from anywhere in my vault and easily access them from the tag pane. These help organize my todo's so I can do them when I am in a certain mood. 

- **\#TO** tags should be used for specific items, not general tasks	
- **\#TO** tags are not daily todo list they are a way to specify a task inline the to be done in the future. These tags should be temporary, but they are not scheduled 
- **\#TO**
	- **\#TO/DO** 
		- **#TO/DO/WRITE** write a specific item, not used for need to write or expand an evergreen note
		- **#TO/PROGRAM** 
		- **#TO/TEND/CONCEPTUALIZE** the thoughts exist but the need to be written out
		- **#TO/DO/REFERENCE** the source is there but unreferenced
		- **#TO/TEND/REFACTOR** 
		- **#TO/DO/FIND** remeber source but don't have easy access
	- **\#TO/EXPLORE**
		- **#TO/EXPLORE/READ** 
		- **#TO/EXPLORE/WATCH**
		- **#TO/EXPLORE/RESEARCH** 
	- **\#TO/PONDER** ideas or concepts that require deep thought.
		- **#TO/PONDER/ME** 
		- **#TO/PONDER/SOCIETY**
	- Optionally if you enjoy looking back your daily accomplishments modify your tags in this way (leave the last part). You can then order search by last modified
	- **\#TO/DONE** 
	- **\#TO/EXPLORED**
	- **\#TO/PONDERED**

- This structure is both a reference for what kind of note it is, but also an entry point to work on [[evergreen notes]]s
- **\#EVER** see all the [[evergreen notes]] in the [[Obsidian (software)]]
	- These essentially functions as my writing inbox. If it doesn't have a body or links it cannot store for long and I needs to be looked at 
	- **\#EVER/SEED** a seed of thought which could lie dormant or could flower quickly
		- **#EVER/SEED/UNPLANTED** has no links into the [[web of thought]]
		- **#EVER/SEED/WATER** has no body
	- Once I have gotten my initial thoughts out I like to let notes mature for a while (so I can gain clarity and find opportunitys to link them elsewhere) before they become evergreens.
	- **\#EVER/SPROUT** a concept that has information and value, but I have no current intention of expanding
		- **#EVER/SPROUT/WATER** I have source notes or ideas that I want to add 
		- **#EVER/SPROUT/CULTIVATE** needs to looked at in relation to other notes, or requires citation or outside content
	- **\#EVER/GREEN** concept that holds weight, value, and knowledge in the [[second brain]] and needs no immediate work
		- **#EVER/GREEN/GROWING** This is a note that has the solid base of a concept and is interlinked with the [[second brain]], but many of those links need water, or are unplanted. This note is not ever/green because the notes linked within in it are actively changing, and that may require to work on the ever/green
		- **#EVER/GREEN/PRUNE** [[evergreen notes]] that needs to be looked at and rethought through in the context of the [[second brain]]. May include adding and removing connections, separating out distinct concepts into their own notes and removing inaccurate information
