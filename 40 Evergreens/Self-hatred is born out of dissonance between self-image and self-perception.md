#### [[Self-hatred is born out of dissonance between self-image and self-perception]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Self-image]] and [[self-perception]] are very closely related concepts, but they can both be influenced by outside factors and when they don't line up you end up with parts of your body and presentation you don't like.

Hatred for yourself is born when you are unhappy with something in your life. Fundamentally this means that your [[perception]] of yourself is not accurate to what you want to be. The difficult part is that both your [[self-image]] and your [[self-perception]] can be out of step with what will actually make you happy. [[Bhuddism outlines a path and practice to end suffering, but does not promise it]]

[[Self-image]] can be influenced by a longing for something that you have never achieved, and once you achieve it you may realize that you never wanted to be that thing. Perhaps this is because you were emulating people around you instead of who you really want to be. Or because you that that [[self-image]] would be an answer to an unrelated problem.

This is very common among [[transgender]] people because as their authentic [[self-image]] is rebuffed they fall back to stereotypical or examples for how they should present. This is why [[transgender|trans]]-masc people being hyper feminine while in the closet, and [[transgender|trans]]-fem people being hyper-masculine while in the closet is fairly common. They were never presenting as their true selves, so they fixated on the most extreme form of their "correct" [[gender]] presentation instead. [[Gender self-socialization model]]

If your [[self-image]] is correct, your [[self-perception]] may be off. You may have some form of [[body dysmorphia]] that prevents you from seeing your [[self]] accurately, or you may have outside forces that are influencing the way you perceive yourself.
