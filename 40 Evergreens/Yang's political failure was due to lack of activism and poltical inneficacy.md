#### [[Yang's political failure was due to lack of activism and poltical inneficacy]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

[[Yang's political success was due to his common sense campaign]] details the ideas and strategy that catapulted Yang into the mainstream of the political world. However, Yang would also come to discredit some of these things in the months after his campaign.

While Yang's presidential run can be seen to have a net positive effect, his run for NYC Mayor cannot. Yang revealed in this race a certain level of political greed that was not evident in his presidential run, most likely because of the much higher stakes. Yang ran for president as an outsider and an underdog, but as soon as he entered the mayoral race he was the top dog. It is impossible to know if Yang decided to run for Mayor out of genuine care for his city, but many raised suspicion of alterior motives. The motives for a Mayoral run are many: gain political legitimacy, gain powerful connections, and influence a city the size of a small nation. Yang came into the race with enough name recognition and good will to launch him into first place, but once he was the one receiving direct attacks, his lack of political instinct, experience, and poise were revealed. Yang's small mistakes were many, and showed a Yang that was not sincere and down to earth, but one that was falling into the political trap. Yang has always had some questionable [[Conservatism|conservative]] rhetoric, such as pushing for strong [[Americanism]] and the [[model minority myth]], but in his support for [[Israel]] over [[Palestine]] he showed either: a genuine belief in [[Zionism]], an incredible need for Zionist support, or a political misstep of massive proportion. In all cases Yang showed a lack of [[empathy]] for the oppressed people of [[Palestine]] for many, supporter or not, this would be the nail in the coffin of Yang's Political career.

Yang's career was never built off of [[activism]] it was built of ideas. While his ideas and his delivery of these ideas were effective, he struggled to create change because his solutions were built for scales out of his control. He then went on to start his own poltical party, with an idea of creating change. We'll see if it works
