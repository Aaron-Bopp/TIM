#### <s class="topic-title">[[homeostatic property cluster]]</s>

The properties that make something a "thing" if it has enough of them.
^[[[video - Social Constructs Philosophy Tube]]]

> Homeostatic property clusters (HPCs) **occur when mechanisms exist that cause the properties to cluster by ensuring that deviations from the cluster have a low chance of persisting**; the presence of some of the properties in the cluster favors the presence of the others.
^[[Natural Kinds (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/natural-kinds)]

In:: [[social construct]] theory,
these property clusters are the properties around an object that have been agree upon by some section of [[society]].
