#### <s class="topic-title">[[functionalism]]</s>

Functionalism is a [[paradigm]] that looks for the relations and uses of parts in a system.

Functionalism is mainly useful in systems where there is some sort of selection at work that creates an environment where more useful parts are prioritized over less useful parts.

[[David Sloan Wilson]] stressed this in [[Darwin's Cathedral by David Sloan Wilson]], where he contrasted the general view of functionalism in the [[social sciences]] with it's view in [[Evolutionary Biology]].
[[Natural selection]] is a strong biological force, that makes functionalism an applicable paradigm for understanding [[adaptation]]. Understanding how selection promotes traits can help us predict the function of traits in animals.
^[[[Proximate explanation never substitutes for ultimate explanation in Evolution]]]
The problem comes when we try to apply this to [[social behavior]] and especially [[human behavior]], as the impacts of [[natural selection]] are much less clear.
Wilson solves this through a revised understanding of [[group selection]], and stresses how powerful a force this is in [[Cultural Evolution]]. 
^[[[Cultural evolution is not confined to the slow process of genetic evolution]]] ^7e0ca9

This view of functionalism may better be understood in the [[social sciences]] by applying a philosophical understanding of [[Holism]].

> Structural functionalism, or simply functionalism, is "a framework for building theory that sees society as a complex system whose parts work together to promote solidarity and stability".This approach looks at society through a macro-level orientation, which is a broad focus on the social structures that shape society as a whole, and believes that society has evolved like organisms. This approach looks at both social structure and social functions. Functionalism addresses society as a whole in terms of the function of its constituent elements; namely norms, customs, traditions, and institutions.
> 
> A common analogy, popularized by Herbert Spencer, presents these parts of society as "organs" that work toward the proper functioning of the "body" as a whole. In the most basic terms, it simply emphasizes "the effort to impute, as rigorously as possible, to each feature, custom, or practice, its effect on the functioning of a supposedly stable, cohesive system". For Talcott Parsons, "structural-functionalism" came to describe a particular stage in the methodological development of social science, rather than a specific school of thought.

> Biological functionalism is an anthropological paradigm, asserting that all social institutions, beliefs, values and practices serve to address pragmatic concerns. In many ways, the theorem derives from the longer-established structural functionalism, yet the two theorems diverge from one another significantly. While both maintain the fundamental belief that a social structure is composed of many interdependent frames of reference, biological functionalists criticise the structural view that a social solidarity and collective conscience is required in a functioning system. By that fact, biological functionalism maintains that our individual survival and health is the driving provocation of actions, and that the importance of social rigidity is negligible.

> In philosophy of mind, functionalism is the thesis that mental states (beliefs, desires, being in pain, etc.) are constituted solely by their functional role, which means, their causal relations with other mental states, sensory inputs and behavioral outputs. Functionalism developed largely as an alternative to the identity theory of mind and behaviorism.
> 
> Functionalism is a theoretical level between the physical implementation and behavioral output. Therefore, it is different from its predecessors of Cartesian dualism (advocating independent mental and physical substances) and Skinnerian behaviorism and physicalism (declaring only physical substances) because it is only concerned with the effective functions of the brain, through its organization or its "software programs".
> 
> Since mental states are identified by a functional role, they are said to be realized on multiple levels; in other words, they are able to be manifested in various systems, even perhaps computers, so long as the system performs the appropriate functions. While a computer's program performs the functions via computations on inputs to give outputs, implemented via its electronic substrate, a brain performs the functions via its biological operation and stimulus responses.
