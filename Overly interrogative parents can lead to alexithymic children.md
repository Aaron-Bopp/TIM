#### [[Overly interrogative parents can lead to alexithymic children]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

As children, we are often interrogated about our emotional state before we have the ability to understand our [[emotions]]. This may be because our [[parents]] are unequipped to deal with our emotional needs or have not equipped us with proper [[coping-mechanisms]].[^1] Being able to explain the emotions you are publicly feeling will relieve the attention that you are receiving. This couples the reward of moving the attention away from oneself with the reward of "fixing" the emotion, but being able to explain what the emotion was (or lying about what it was[^2]) does not mean we have effectively dealt with the emotion. If this [[feedback loop]] continues, children can develop very strong [[defense-mechanisms]] around sharing their emotions:
[[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]]

[^1]: [[Parents need to model the ability to deal with emotion to their children]]
[^2]: [[Trans children will repress their dysphoria if they have been effectively taught it is unacceptable]]

[[Children in traumatic households expect more love than their parents can give|Parents will not be able to protect their children from every source of trauma]], but parent's can work to equip their children with the tools to succeed in spite of their shortcomings: [[How can parent's best help their children]]

[[We carry our childhood wounds into adulthood]], but there are ways to retrain the [[brain]]'s response to emotion: [[How to process repressed emotions]]
