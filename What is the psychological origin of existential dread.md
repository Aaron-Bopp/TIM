#### [[What is the psychological origin of existential dread]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`



#TO/PONDER/IDEA What is existential dread?

Human's are not unfamiliar to feelings and [[emotions]] that they cannot explain:
[[Human's will find explanations for inexplainable things]]

Having a [[feeling of impending doom]] is a recognized symptom of medications like [[Adenosine]] and often precedes death.
