#### [[Meditation helps us detach negative attachments]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

The [[Association Cortices]] are what make the attachments that we use to survive
^[[[Our brains are built around survival]]]
but they do that by lodging things in our [[subconscious]] called [[Samskara]]. If those attachments are left unchecked it can lead to very bad things 
^[[[Humans are primarily irrational, illogical, emotional beings]]]
but [[meditation]] allows us to gain [[control]] over our [[subconscious]] and [[detachment]] from those [[emotions]].
