#### [[Evergreen notes don't allow for new ideas]]

This 
contrasts:: [[Evergreen notes organize knowledge so that it can grow]]

As I have described this system to people, they sometimes ask, "What if the notes that you keep coming back to are wrong?" I have also heard people refer to reviewing their own notes as, "Succumbing to their personal [[propaganda]]." I understand these concerns as there is a large amount of self reference in [[evergreen notes]]. If you are not being cognizant, a logical fallacy could weave it's way into your notes, effectively poisoning your [[second brain]]. This isn't something I have experienced, but then again, most people aren't aware of the logical fallacies they believe.
^[[[Rationalizations are defense-mechanisms against strong emotions]]]
However, I think that as long as you are ingesting new idea's from outside sources, and going back and reviewing old notes in light of that new [[information]] you are actually going to less likely to fall into this trap than most people. 

If you hold a [[stereotype]], but don't actually interact with that [[stereotype]] very often, you aren't going to think about it. You may have learned new perspectives that contradict that stereotype, but because you never think about it, you have not deconstructed that old idea. When that stereotype does come up, your old ideas will come to the surface, and you may not realize how they contradict your new perspectives. This could lead to [[cognitive dissonance]], and hopefully would lead to you reconsidering that [[stereotype]], but that doesn't always happen: [[Human's have an inability to admit that they are wrong]]

However, if you had put this stereotype into your [[evergreen notes]] (most likely indirectly),
you would have reviewed it as you learned new perspectives, 
and would have given it up much sooner. 
In this way I think evergreen notes would be better for allowing new ideas.
Especially if you are following [[Evergreen notes should be updated over time]]
