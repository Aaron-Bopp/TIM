#### [[Finding Harmony]]

hp fanfic taking place shortly after the war
AU where Ron dies instead of Fred and Ginny is dating Susan Bones.
The fic is centered around Hermione and Harry's journeys to reconcile with their actions in the war, the loss of the friend, the fact that there is no hope of returning to how things were before.

This includes
Harry and Hermione travelling to Australia and finding that Hermione's parents need much more than a simple memory charm reversal.
The process of recovering their memories is complicated by the fact that they have been seeing Hermione in their dreams constantly.

Once in Australia the dynamic is similar to their tent days, as they generate plans for solutions and to attempt solutions on Hermione's parents

#### Ch1
Start off with Ron's funeral
We find Harry and Hermione contemplating their relationship with Ron and realize that the only other person to understand it is each other
Hermione is under the impression that Harry is in a good spot, about to start dating ginny and go to Auror academy, but he reveals that Ginny is seriously dating (Susan or Neville or both)
Hermione has already started to research reversing her parents memories and knows that it will be complicated. Harry sees right through her deflection and offers to accompany her

Haze.

There was a thick haze surrounding the Burrow in late July, brought on by a lack of rain that summer. It felt only natural to Hermione, who had been in her own haze for the last month.
In some ways the war had ended one month earlier with Harry defeating Voldemort. 
The culmination of months of traypsing through the woods, thousands of hours of research and planning, and finally some insane luck.
But in other ways that was just the beginning of end.
The task of killing a man with 7 life lines, one of which being the very of life of your best friend, should have felt like the success of life time, 
but Hermione had been in the Order meetings since that showed it was anything but.
The ministry is practically falling apart,
half of its departments erroded by months of Death Eater meddling,
and the other half suffering from the losses of vital staff members.
Hogwarts was worse.
For years Hogwarts was supposedly one of the safest places on the planet, although that never seemed to help Harry, but Hermione had still never expected to hear the kinds of stories that she did from the students who'd stayed.
Ginny and Neville's bodies were now littered with scars that would never heal. 
Scars that they had taken willingly trying to protect other students.
Half of the student body reportedly had tremors from repeated rounds of Crucio.
Of course, this was all preferable to the most broken thing after the war, families.
Muggleborns and blood traitors had died in droves in snatcher raids and Azkaban. 
Even families who were nominally safe often had a family member taken for extortion that was either returned maimed or dead.

Of course Hermione had her own selection of war wounds. Scars littered her body, her hands still trembled when she got too tired, and of course her wrist was marked by wound that was constantly leaked and scabbed over and never seemed to heal.
But even her body felt undamaged compared to her mind.
Hermione now had three modes, numb, hazy, and panicked. 
Numb was the best in her opinion. 
She could do simple tasks, sometimes even read a bit, but really she didn't feel like she needed to do anything.
Sometimes she would just sit, numb and cold, staring out the windows of Gimmauld place. 
She could sit for hours now, not doing a thing, not feeling a thing, and not thinking. 
Hermione had never really viewed thinking as something she did.
Her mind had never stopped, never been able to stop for as long as she could remember. 
Of course she new that she wasn't normal, that she did more than other kids, and that when she tried to talk at the speed she thought they wouldn't listen to her anymore.
When she was a kid she tried to stop herself. biting her tongue and worrying her lower lip just to try to let other kids get a word in. 
She would try to listen, try to respond, but as soon as she started going again she couldn't stop. 
Now she savored stopping, because if she let her thoughts in the haze would come to.
It felt like wading through a cloud, constantly being smothered but never feeling secure. Desperately reaching for something to grab onto.
But this was still preferable to panicked. 
It would happen after she woke up from a nightmare, or she was triggered.
Her mind would go back into war mode, a river of thoughts rushing through.



And Hermione had saved her parents.

Saved? Right?
