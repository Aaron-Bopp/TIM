#### [[Finding Harmony]]

hp fanfic taking place shortly after the war
AU where Ron dies instead of Fred and Ginny is dating Susan Bones.
The fic is centered around Hermione and Harry's journeys to reconcile with their actions in the war, the loss of the friend, the fact that there is no hope of returning to how things were before.

This includes
Harry and Hermione travelling to Australia and finding that Hermione's parents need much more than a simple memory charm reversal.
The process of recovering their memories is complicated by the fact that they have been seeing Hermione in their dreams constantly.

Once in Australia the dynamic is similar to their tent days, as they generate plans for solutions and to attempt solutions on Hermione's parents

#### Ch1
Start off with Ron's funeral
We find Harry and Hermione contemplating their relationship with Ron and realize that the only other person to understand it is each other
Hermione is under the impression that Harry is in a good spot, about to start dating ginny and go to Auror academy, but he reveals that Ginny is seriously dating (Susan or Neville or both)
Hermione has already started to research reversing her parents memories and knows that it will be complicated. Harry sees right through her deflection and offers to accompany her

Haze.

There was a thick haze surrounding the Burrow in late July, brought on by a lack of rain that summer. It felt only natural to Hermione, who had been in her own haze for the last month.
In some ways the war had ended one month earlier with Harry defeating Voldemort. 
The culmination of months of traypsing through the woods, thousands of hours of research and planning, and finally some insane luck.
But in other ways that was just the beginning of end.
The task of killing a man with 7 life lines, one of which being the very of life of your best friend, should have felt like the success of life time, 
but Hermione had been in the Order meetings since that showed it was anything but.
The ministry is practically falling apart,
half of its departments erroded by months of Death Eater meddling,
and the other half suffering from the losses of vital staff members.
Hogwarts was worse.
For years Hogwarts was supposedly one of the safest places on the planet, although that never seemed to help Harry, but Hermione had still never expected to hear the kinds of stories that she did from the students who'd stayed.
Ginny and Neville's bodies were now littered with scars that would never heal. 
Scars that they had taken willingly trying to protect other students.
Half of the student body reportedly had tremors from repeated rounds of Crucio.
Of course, this was all preferable to the most broken thing after the war, families.
Muggleborns and blood traitors had died in droves in snatcher raids and Azkaban. 
Even families who were nominally safe often had a family member taken for extortion that was either returned maimed or dead.

Of course Hermione had her own selection of war wounds. Scars littered her body, her hands still trembled when she got too tired, and of course her wrist was marked by wound that was constantly leaked and scabbed over and never seemed to heal.
But even her body felt undamaged compared to her mind.
Hermione now had three modes, numb, hazy, and panicked. 
Numb was the best in her opinion. 
She could do simple tasks, sometimes even read a bit, but really she didn't feel like she needed to do anything.
Sometimes she would just sit, numb and cold, staring out the windows of Gimmauld place. 
She could sit for hours now, not doing a thing, not feeling a thing, and not thinking. 
Hermione had never really viewed thinking as something she did.
Her mind had never stopped, never been able to stop for as long as she could remember. 
Of course she new that she wasn't normal, that she did more than other kids, and that when she tried to talk at the speed she thought they wouldn't listen to her anymore.
When she was a kid she tried to stop herself. biting her tongue and worrying her lower lip just to try to let other kids get a word in. 
She would try to listen, try to respond, but as soon as she started going again she couldn't stop. 
Now she savored stopping, because if she let her thoughts in the haze would come to.
It felt like wading through a cloud, constantly being smothered but never feeling secure. Desperately reaching for something to grab onto.
But this was still preferable to panicked. 
It would happen after she woke up from a nightmare, or she was triggered.
Her mind would go back into war mode, a river of thoughts rushing through.



And Hermione had saved her parents.

Saved? Right?


Hermione woke up absolutely exhausted. After being pushed out of her parents minds last night by the pure strength of her own obliviation spell, she was drained on ever single level.

Hermione turned over to look at the other side of the tent, but Harry's cot was empty. In fact, it was perfectly made. Had it even been slept in?

By the time Hermione dragged herself out of bed, showered, and ate it was almost ten and Harry was still nowhere to be seen. She contemplated sending a patronus, something that was always a bit risky, but the fact that they had been interacting with muggles so much recently stayed her hand. Breaking the statute of secrecy may not be as bad as giving information to Death Eaters or alerting your position to snatchers but it certainly involved more paperwork.

Besides, Harry had been with her last night. He had brought her back to the tent, sat with while she sobbed, held her hand and made her tea. Of course he hadn't gone to bed when she did, she was the emotionally drained failure of a daughter not him.

Before Hermione could fall back into her spiral of self-hatred, she heard a whistling from outside the tent, followed by the entrance of extremely chipper looking boy who lived.

"Hey Hermione! How you feeling?"

"Fine, not as good as you I gather."

"Well hopefully that will change soon. Come on let's get the tent."

"Harry we can't just leave after one try!"

"Of course not! Come on we are meeting them at the house in fifteen minutes we need to get going."

"Harry where the hell have you been!" This finally elicited a response as Harry looked at her with a gleam in his eyes. Hermione couldn't remember the last time he had looked like this, actually, had he ever looked this? His whole demeanor was different, shoulders light, body relaxed, walking around the room gathering things like he was dancing on clouds. It was the most Dumbledorish thing she had seen since second year and, wait, are his eyes fucking sparkling?!

"Errands," as he said this his demeanor finally seemed to dim, and there was moment of guilt, loss, sadness, that rushed over Hermione. "Sorry, I shouldn't have left you without a note you've probably been worrying all morning. There's nothing to be concerned about. We're not leaving your parents, we're not giving up, I just secured us some more permanent lodgings."

"Now, they are actually meeting us there on the hour and we should get going. Again, don't worry I will explain everything."

With that they were moving, packing and securing with an efficiency only born out of months on the run together. Hermione was momentarily sated, but her mind was rushing with questions. What the hell kind of errands keep you up all night and leave you with a skip in your step? And what did he mean permanent lodgings? And how long was he planning on staying here?!! Obviously last night didn't go well but she was still hoping that they could clear this up relatively quickly. They hadn't even talked about time frames yet. It was still June and any obligation they had even considered was months away, but permanent??

Still there was something else keeping Hermione at bay. Harry hadn't just walked into the tent with cheeriness, it was confidence. Hermione had seen Harry confident before but it was mainly on the Quidditch pitch and... on the Quidditch pitch. Hunting horcruxes while the entire country was slowly turned against you was definitely not confidence inducing for any of them, and even after killing Voldemort, the most confident she had probably seen Harry was when he was walking to accept his own death.

As they were pulling out the last of tent pegs and magically folding the tent in on itself Hermione made a decision. Whatever the confidence was coming from, it didn't matter. She trusted Harry and knew that when he did put the planning side of his brain to work it usually went well. Besides, confidence looked good on him. 

"Ready?" Harry was offering his hand, the cheeriness fully returned, and maybe just the tiniest hint of a sparkle.

"Yep!" As Hermione grasped his hand there was an instant pull at her navel. The ride was short, and suddenly they were back in her parents neighborhood, but instead of walking towards her parent's house they passed right by it, walking up the front path of the neighbors. Hermione was practically being pulled, her hand still tightly held.

As they approached the door opened and out stepped a tan man with sandy blonde hair. He was wearing a loose fitting short sleeve button down with an interesting but subdued pattern, and there was a wand in his hand. "Goodaye, mate! Welcome to your new home."

"What?" Hermione was trying to stay calm but her voice was far more shrieky than she wanted it to be. She was in shock now and her past resolution to keep her questions to herself was failing.

"Oh a surprise for the missus? Lucky gal. Come on in and we'll get the wards transferred over to you and be on our way. The Auror office will send the rest of the paperwork through the floo. Wand?" Harry quickly handed over his wand and the sandy haired man was off to the living room. Handing his wand over to a brown haired woman who quickly keyed it into the floo before handing it back.

"Harry, I know you said you'd explain everything but I'm starting to doubt that is even possible. How are we in this house? Don't muggles live here?"

"Yep!" There was a slight hint of amusement in his voice but before Hermione could question it, loudly, he had released her hand and was walking over to sandy-hair. Taking his wand they performed a ward transference, and then they were shaking hands. "Thanks for all your help Phil, I really appreciate."

"Of course Mr. Potter. Happy to help."

"Oh please call me Harry, you've more than earned it."

"Well my kid will love to hear that. By the way tell Shacklebolt that Diggerton sends her regards, and that she has a potion that instantly cures international floo sickness." With a wink he was gone, turning to the floo and calling out the name of the Sydney Auror's office. 

The house was quiet. Hermione was gazing intently at the fireplace still questioning everything that just happened as Harry turned to face her.

"Well I suppose I owe you some explanation." There was that sparkle again, and was that grin sly or devious? Why was Harry Potter looking at her with a devious grin!

"That could be the underestimation of the century. I don't even know where to start but...what? how? why?" Hermione couldn't help but throw up her hands and gesticulate wildly. She was more than happy to accept confident Harry, but why did it have to be accompanied by devious and not forthcoming Harry!

"Here let's go to the kitchen I'll start us some tea. I think the why is probably the simplest part. I thought we could use a place to plan that was more comfortable than the tent, and that being close to your parents would offer us some unique chances to observe their behavior. I also took the liberty to request some muggle identities, still British of course but something to help us blend in easier. I think they should hopefully come within the next few d-"

"HARRY!"

"What??" Harry had been animatedly getting the tea going while talking, but was now staring at her startled.

"I'm sorry, but- Harry I know that muggles lived here. Where are they?"

With this his grin was back, and he relaxed again leaning on the counter. "Cruise."

"They just happened to be leaving for a cruise today?"

"Well, I'm sure they were elated to be gifted an all expenses paid summer long worldwide cruise and were eager to get going." Harry was looking a bit sheepish now but at her piercing stare and silence he continued. "Hermione I told you there's nothing to worry about, and you should know. Now that I have full control of my parents vaults money isn't an issue so do-"

"Harry how long have you been working on this?"

"This morning."

"This. Morning." Hermione's eyes were hot, tears brimming at their edges. "You got this all done this morning. Harry, do you even realize what you've done? All expenses paid or not I know there's no way you didn't have to confund them to get them out this quickly. Did you even check to see if they had responsibilities to care to? Businesses to run? Family who will check in on them? Did you really think you could just use magic to get a couple of muggles out of your way after everything we've been working on? The whole damn reason we're here! Besides you need permits for this stuff Harry! You can't just confund any muggle you want, we could get in massive trouble! I know the Auror was here but did you tell him that you just broke international law so you could-"

"Hermione! Stop!" His voice was muffled as he spoke into her curls. His hand wrapped around the back of her head, the other holding her close to his chest.

He had moved so fast. Grabbing her and holding her before she even had a chance to fully fall apart. 

"Why the hell would I not want to help my best friend get a second chance to have a life with her parents?"

Hermione was crying now, sobbing really. Her hands curled into the back of Harry's jumper. "It's too much Harry. You're doing too much." 

"It will never be enough"
