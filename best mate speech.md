First I just want to thank Mr and Mrs Trani. I know that you two have been instrumental in every part of this wedding, as well extremely kind and gracious to everybody in the wedding party.

I am probably an unfamiliar face to most of you here today so allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Aaron and I have know Patrick for approximately, 1431 days. For those keeping track that's around 34 thousand hours, 2 million minutes, or a 123 million seconds

That amount of time takes us all the way back to freshman year of college, where I met Patrick at our Computer Science orientation.

As soo as we met, I remember thinking to myself that this is the kind of person that I could not just get along with
but someone that I could become very close with.

I'm not sure what convinced me of this so early on.
Maybe it was the fact that our similar backgrounds had led shared sense of humor.
Maybe it was the fact that we both had similar goals for the future.
Or
Maybe it was just that out of many computer science students there we were the only ones capable of holding a conversation.

Let me set the stage for freshman year.

For those that don't know, the person sitting to my right is Jarren Jackson and was my roommate freshman year and Patrick and I's roommate for the rest of college.

Jarren and I quickly bonded over the fact that we were generally happy to ignore each other and do our own thing
If our freshman year was a sitcom our pitch would be:
Two introverted roommates living together but separate,
and their squatter, who was in their room for no less than 8 hours a day despite not living there.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we socialize on average only 39 minutes per day.
For Patrick, I would say the average is about four hours.

Patrick has a simple way of making friends,
he's funny, smart, willing to listen and willing to talk, and most important of all he will not leave you alone.
But despite the fact that if given the choice Jarren or I would often choose solitude, once Patrick is there you don't really want him to leave.

Patrick has been gifted with a personality that is hard to hate and easy to love.

%% Now you might think from the situation that we are in and what have heard so far that I met and became friend with Kayla through Patrick. %%
You could list thousands of reasons that Patrick and Kayla got together, but in my eyes there is only one, the person introduced them, myself.

I met Kayla mostly by happenstance, as most college friendships start, two people living in the same dorm, recognizing each other from a game of cards, and sitting together in the cafeteria.
It was here the Kayla first met Patrick.
In the same way that I was instantly drawn in by Patrick's wit and charisma, almost as soon as I introduced Patrick and Kayla I could feel the chemistry.

Very quickly we started to form a tight friend group,
bonding over board games and deep conversation.
But Patrick and Kayla bonded a different way: incessant teasing and competition.
From stolen shoes to coveted blankets to intense rounds of Catan, the sparks were not just flying, but catching.
The inevitability of their relationship was obvious to everyone, and when they eventually told me that they were finally together, I quite literally screamed with joy and ran out of the room in excitement.

Funnily enough, I would have known this fact several hours earlier if Jarren and I hadn't locked Patrick out of our room when he had come to tell us.
The reason we refused to let him in despite his excitement,
he had gotten Chick-fil-a without us...

I still think it was justified.

Over the next few years I got to see Patrick and Kaylas relationship grow 
and also become close with the art department through KaylaKaylaKaylin... and Hannah.

I may be the reason Kayla met Patrick, but she is the reason that I got to spend so much time with this lovely group of people.

Over the years I have gotten to see Kayla from her most energetic to her most weary,
and I have also gotten to see Patrick match her in all of it.
Either to cheer her on, or to take care of her,
Patrick was there, unwilling to leave her alone.

In addition to his fantastic personality,
Patrick is intensely humble. Despite his repeated success in sports, academics, and professional life, he is always willing to admit it that he might be wrong and always willing to try to do better in the future.

Kayla is one of the most lovely people I have had the pleasure of knowing. 
She's ambitious, hard-working, and passionate, and this is all powered by her childlike love for all things precious and beautiful.


I can say that from the very beginning I knew that Patrick and Kayla would go the distance,
and I can say now that I can't see them stopping.
