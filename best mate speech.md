I am probably an unfamiliar face to most of you here today so allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Aaron and I have know Patrick for approximately 1431 days. For those keeping track that's around 34 thousand hours, 2 million minutes, or a 123 million seconds.
-   123,638,400 seconds
-   2,060,640 minutes
-   34,344 hours

That takes us all the way back to freshman year of college, where I met Patrick at our Computer Science orientation.
I was immediately drawn to Patrick.
As we started to chat, I remember thinking to myself that is the kind of person that I could get along with.

I'm not sure if it was the fact that our similar backgrounds had led shared sense of humor
Maybe it was just that out of the few that talked, and the fewer that showered, we were the only ones capable of holding a conversation.

Let me set the stage for freshman year.

Prior to orientation I had done what any responsible introvert would and had signed up for the Tinderesque roommate app so that I could find roommate I could actually get along with.
For those that don't know, the person I found is the other unfamiliar face sitting to my right.
We immediately bonded over the fact 
Two introverts living together, adjusting to the strange new environment of college
and their squatter, who stays in their room despite not living for there for no less than 8 hours a day.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we socialize on average only 39 minutes per day.
For Patrick, I would say the average is about four hours.

Patrick has a simple way of making friends,
he's funny, smart, willing to listen and willing to talk, and most important of all he will take any and all teasing that you throw at him.

Kayla is one of the most lovely people I have had the pleasure of knowing. 
She's ambitious, hard-working, and passionate about her work, but this is all powered by her childlike love for all things precious and beautiful.

Patrick is intensely humble. Despite his repeated success in life he is always willing to admit it when he is wrong and always willing to try to do better in the future
