# What am I trying to get done now?
- Flesh out the second iteration of my note taxonomy => what are the place of term notes/topic notes, what should classified as an evergreen note, what are the kind of things that don't lend themselves well to atomic notes, how interested in a topic do I need to be to bring it into my vault
	- What is the place of studies in my vault, how important is it to find a way to bring them into the vault if I am not doing academic literature?
- Create archiver for twitter threads => trying to create a map of intellectual web of thought twitter and a tool for people to do the same. 
- Work through all of my evergreen notes using [[Spaced Repetition (plugin)]] 
	- <progress max="178" value="84"/>
# What are my long term goals ^1230193
- [[Develop Obsidian plugins|Plugin Ideas]]
- create a custom site for my second brain =>  some kind of AI assistant, being able to import dataview queries, every note has a "tweet me what you think about this note" that will open a tweet with the link to the note
- Find ways to meaningfully contribute to open source/developer communities
- transition
