#### [[What constitutes a decision]] `$=customJS.dv_funcs.evergreenHeader(dv, this)`

part of:: [[Do we have free will]]

[[Mental health is a reaction to one's environment]], and we often make decisions like whether to get out of bed in the morning or workout based on how we feel, blaming [[depression]] or [[ADHD]]. 
If we believe that these really are impacting our ability to do these things, who or what is making the decision when we do decide to do those things.

Is a decision all of the infleunces leading up to an action or is it just the moment of turning one way or the next.
